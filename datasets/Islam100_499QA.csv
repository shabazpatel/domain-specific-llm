100,"If he sets up a waqf for his children and their children, that does not include the children of his daughters","Question My father died, and he had sons and daughters. He made his property a waqf for his sons and daughters, which means that they cannot sell it; rather the money generated from the waqf is distributed monthly to his heirs, both sons and daughters. But before he died, our father wrote a will, as follows: that if one of his married daughters dies, the waqf [in her case] ends, and nothing is to be given to her sons and daughters. On the other hand, if one of his sons dies, the waqf passes to the sons and daughters of the deceased heir. This was signed by the heirs, but not all of them. My mother did not know about this will, because her father – as is written in the will – went to the judge himself, but there is no signature of her father or any witnesses in the will; there is only the signature of the judge. Is this will valid? Is it to be executed? If the will is not valid, then what should we do? Is it possible to contest the will?","Praise be to Allah.It is valid to set up a waqf for one’s offspring, for one’s children, or for one’s children then their children. If someone sets up a waqf for his children, that does not include the children of his daughters. It says in Zaad al-Mustaqni‘: If someone sets up a waqf for his children or for the children of someone else, then for the poor, then it is to be interpreted as being a waqf for his children, both male and female equally, then for the offspring of his sons, but not of his daughters, as if he said it is for the offspring of his children, that is, the offspring of his own loins. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words “but not of his daughters” mean that the offspring of his daughters are excluded, because the offspring of his daughters are not regarded as being his own offspring. If he said: This is a waqf for my children, and he has three sons and a daughter, and these four – the sons and the daughter – died, leaving behind children, then the children of his sons are entitled to the waqf, but the children of the daughter have no share of it. The evidence for this is in the Holy Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females” [an-Nisaa’ 4:11]. The scholars are unanimously agreed that the children of daughters are not included in a man’s children (offspring), because the children of daughters come under the heading of dhawi’l-arhaam (relatives), not his own offspring (from his own loins). The same applies if he says, This is a waqf for my children, and he has children of his sons and children of his daughters; the children of his daughters are not entitled to anything (of the waqf), because they do not come under the heading of his children or offspring. This is clearly mentioned in the Qur’an and it is what is implied by both custom and linguistic usage. The poet said: Our sons are the sons of our sons; as for our daughters, their sons are the sons of men who are not related to us. Even in cases where close relatives are required to pay diyah (blood money), the children of daughters are not expected to contribute. And with regard to guardianship for marriage, the sons of daughters cannot be guardians. Based on that, we say: the children of daughters are not included in a man’s waqf for his children (and offspring). The evidence for that comes from the Qur’an and from linguistic usage. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (11/44). This applies if the one who sets up the waqf spoke in general terms (without specifying further), and said: This is for my children and their children, or for my children then their children. But if he clearly stated that the children of his daughters are not to be included, then that makes it even clearer and more blunt, and leaves no room for dispute. It should be understood that the Hanbalis, who made it obligatory to be equitable in the giving of gifts to one’s children – in contrast to the majority – do not make that obligatory in the case of a waqf, even if the waqf is made for a man’s own children; rather they only regarded that as mustahabb (encouraged or recommended). It says in Daleel at-Taalib (p. 191): It is makrooh (disliked) to give precedence to some of his children over others for no reason; the Sunnah is not to give more to males than females. End quote. Conclusion: The waqf mentioned is valid, as the judge approved it. If anyone has any concerns about it, he should refer to the judge who approved it or to the sharee‘ah court. And Allah knows best."
101,The hadeeth of Tameem al-Daari about the Dajjaal,"Question Is it true that a group of Muslims were on a journey, and they met a man who asked them about the era they were in and about the mission of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he came back and said that this was not the time for him to emerge, and it was said that he was the Dajjaal?.","Praise be to Allah.The story that you mention was narrated in a well known hadeeth which is known as the hadeeth of al-Jassaasah. It is an important hadeeth which was one of the signs of his Prophethood, so we will give you the opportunity to benefit from it and enjoy reading it. It was narrated that Faatimah bint Qays (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I heard the voice of the caller, the caller of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), saying: Al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin), so I went out to the mosque and I prayed with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I was in the women’s row that was closest to the people. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the minbar and he was smiling. He said: “Let each person stay in the place where he just prayed.” Then he said: “Do you know why I called you together?” They said: Allaah and His Messenger know best. He said: He said: “By Allah, I did not call you together for an exhortation or for a warning. I have called you together because Tameem al-Daari was a Christian and he came and swore allegiance and became Muslim, and told me something which agrees with what I was telling you about the Dajjaal (false messiah). He told me that he sailed in a ship with thirty men of Lakhm and Judhaam and they were tossed by the waves of the sea for a month. Then they came to an island at sunset. They sat in a small rowing-boat and landed on that island. They were met by a beast with a great deal of hair and they could not distinguish his face from his back because he was so hairy. They said: ‘Woe to you, what are you?’ It said: ‘I am al-Jassaasah.’ They said: ‘What is al-Jassaasah?’ It said: ‘O people, go to this man in the monastery for he keen to know about you.’ He (the narrator) said: When it named a man for us we were afraid of it lest it be a devil. Then we set off, rushing, until we came to that monastery, where we found the hugest man we had ever seen, bound strongly in chains with his hands tied to his neck and his legs bound from the knees to the ankles with iron shackles. We said: ‘Woe to you, who are you?’ He said: ‘You will soon find out about me; tell me who you are.’ They said: ‘We are people from Arabia who embarked on a ship, but the sea became wild and the waves tossed us about for one month, then they brought us to this island of yours. We took to the rowing-boats and landed on this island. We were met by a beast with a great deal of hair and we could not tell his front from his back because he was so hairy. We said: Woe to you, what are you? It said: I am al-Jassaasah. We said: What is al-Jassaasah? It said: Go to this man in the monastery for he is keen to know about you. So we came rushing to you and we fled from it because we could not be sure that it was not a devil.’ He (that chained person) said: ‘Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baysaan.’ We said: ‘What do you want to know about them?’ He said: ‘I am asking you whether these trees bear fruit.’ We said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Soon they will not bear fruit.’ He said: ‘Tell me about the lake of Tabariyyah’ We said: ‘What do you want to know about it?’ He said: ‘Is there water in it?’ They said: ‘There is a great deal of water in it.’ He said: ‘Soon it will dry up.’ Then he said: ‘Tell me about the spring of Zughar (which is in the south of Syria).’ They said: ‘What do you want to know about it?’ He said: ‘Is there water in the spring and do the people grow crops with the water of the spring?’ We said to him: ‘Yes, there is plenty of water in it and the people grow crops with its water.’ He said: ‘Tell me about the Prophet if the unlettered; what has he done?’ We said: ‘He has left Makkah and has settled in Yathrib (Madeenah).’ He said: ‘Do the Arabs fight against him?’ We said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘How did he deal with them?’ We told him that he had prevailed over the Arabs in his vicinity and they had shown obedience to him. He said to us: ‘Has it really happened?’ We said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘If it is so that is better for them that they show obedience to him. Now I will tell you about myself. I am the Dajjaal and soon I will be given permission to emerge. So I will come out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town but I will stay for forty nights, except Makkah and Taybah (Madeenah). They are both forbidden to me; every time I try to enter one of them, I will be met by an angel with a sword in his hand, who will bar my way, and on every route there will be angels guarding it.’ She said: Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) struck the minbar with his staff and said: “This is Taybah, this is Taybah, this is Taybah,” meaning Madeenah. “Did I net tell you this before?” The people said: Yes. [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:] “I liked the story of Tameem because it agrees with what I used to tell you about him and about Makkah and Madeenah. But he is in the Syrian Sea (Mediterranean) or the Yemeni Sea (Arabian Sea). No, rather he is in the east, he in the east, he is in the east,” and he pointed towards the east with his hand. She said: I memorized this from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh (2942), so it is a saheeh hadeeth. It was also narrated by the scholars in their books, with their isnaads from Faatimah bint Qays (may Allaah be pleased with her). Al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Jaami’ al-Saheeh (2253): This is a saheeh ghareeb hadeeth. End quote. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Istidhkaar (7/338): It is saheeh in its isnaad and transmission. End quote. For more information please see questions no. 8301, 8806 and 32665. And Allaah knows best."
102,Cutting hair to make it all of equal length is permissible so long as one does not resemble the kuffaar,Question What is the ruling on muslim men cutting there hair is there limitaions like it has to be done equall length..Please explain this,"Praise be to Allah. Cutting hair to make it all of equal length, reaching the shoulders or ears is OK, so long as that does not involve resembling the kuffaar. Resembling the kuffaar is haraam even if it is in regard to something that in principle is permitted. With regard to cutting some of the hair and leaving some of it, that is not permitted. This is the hairstyle which was forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and elsewhere. This ruling applies to both men and women. It is OK to cut the hair and make it of equal length so long as that does not involve resembling the kuffaar, or making men resemble women and vice versa. Women should not cut their hair short in a manner that resembles men’s hairstyles."
103,"Meaning of the verse {and [yet], do not forget your share of the world}","Question What is the meaning of the verse {and [yet], do not forget your share of the world} [al-Qasas 28:77]?","Praise be to Allah.There are two famous scholarly views regarding the interpretation of this verse. The first view: is that the meaning is: Do not forget your share of what Allah has permitted to you in this world of food, drink, clothing, housing and marriage, for your Lord has a right over you, your own self has a right over you, and your wife has a right over you.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 6/253). This is the view of al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ibn Jurayj. Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about this verse, and he said: It means living, eating and drinking without imposing unnecessary restrictions on oneself.""(Al-Muntaqa 4/302). This view is supported by the words that precede these: { But seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter} [al-Qasas 28:77]. In other words: use what Allah has given you of this abundant wealth and blessings to obey your Lord and seek to draw close to Him by doing different acts of worship and righteous deeds, through which you may attain reward in the hereafter, yet at the same time do not forget your share of this world. So We do not instruct you to give all your wealth in charity and leave yourself destitute; rather spend for your hereafter and enjoy your life in this world in such a way that will not harm your faith or your hereafter. See: Tafsir at-Tabari (19/625); Tafsir Ibn Kathir (6/253); Zad al-Masir (6/241); Tafsir as-Sa‘di (p. 623). Islam takes a middle course with regard to striving for this world and the hereafter, for both come under the heading of worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, and fulfilling the purpose for which humans were created, within certain conditions. Other religions and ideologies, on the other hand, waiver between focusing solely on materialistic matters, as in the case of modern Western civilisation, whose object of worship is wealth, power, luxury and material prosperity, and scorning material prosperity and worldly enjoyment, as in the case of religions and ideologies that promote monasticism and mortification of the flesh for the purpose of spiritual benefit and discipline in order to attain annihilation of the self or ego death. But in Islam, Allah, may He be exalted, says: {Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire} [al-Baqarah 2:201] {But seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and [yet], do not forget your share of the world. And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters} [al-Qasas 28:177]. Buhuth Nadwah Athar al-Qur’an fi Tahqiq al-Wasatiyyah wa Daf‘ al-Ghulu (p. 400). The second view: is that it means do not forget your share of this world, but use it as a means to attain your goals in the hereafter. This view was favoured by most of the commentators, and it is the view of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him). Ash-Shawkani said: The majority of commentators said that it means striving during the life of this world for the hereafter, and the person’s share [of this world] is his lifespan and his righteous deeds. Az-Zajjaj said: What it means is: do not forget to strive for your hereafter, because a person’s true share of this world is what he uses for his hereafter.""(Fath al-Qadir 4/266). It was narrated that Mujahid said: It is your lifespan, during which you strive for your hereafter.""(Tafsir Ibn Abi Hatim 9/3010). Mujahid also said: Do not fail to strive in this world for the hereafter, so that you may be saved from punishment, because a person’s true share of this world is striving for the hereafter.""(Tafsir al-Baghawi 6/221). ‘Awn ibn ‘Abdillah said: Some people misunderstand the words {and [yet], do not forget your share of the world}, but what it really means is: Strive in this world to obey Allah [and do righteous deeds].""(Tafsir at-Tabari 19/524). At-Tabari said: It means: do not ignore your share in this world, and use your share in this world for the hereafter; strive in this world to do that which will save you from the punishment of Allah in the future.""(Tafsir at-Tabari 19/524). Al-Qurtubi said: There was a difference of opinion concerning it. Ibn ‘Abbaas and the majority said: [It means:] do not waste your life by failing to strive in doing righteous deeds in this world, because the hereafter is something to be striven for. So a person’s share [in this world] is his lifespan and the righteous deeds he does in his life. Hence according to this interpretation, it is a strict kind of exhortation. Al-Hasan and Qatadah said: What it means is: Do not neglect your share in this world, in the sense of enjoying what is permissible and seeking it, and at the same time think of the outcome of your life in this world. According to this interpretation, there is some gentleness in this phrase, and advice to take care of what one desires.""(Al-Jami‘ li Ahkam al-Qur’an 13/314). There is no contradiction between the two views, because the believer should not forget his share of this world, and he may have some permissible enjoyment that will not draw him towards what is prohibited. This type of permissible enjoyment will help him to obey Allah, may He be exalted, and do righteous deeds, so this enjoyment becomes like a kind of refreshment and restoration of his energy. The believer does not forget his share of this world, which is his righteous deeds which will accompany him in his grave. Hence Allah, may He be exalted, praises those who offer the supplication: {Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire} [al-Baqarah 2:201]. Ibn Kathir said: This supplication combines seeking everything that is good in this world and warding off everything that is bad. For what is good in this world includes everything that is desirable in this realm, such as well-being, a comfortable home, a beautiful wife, abundant provision, beneficial knowledge, righteous deeds, an amenable mount, the commendation of others, and other things that the commentators have listed. There is no contradiction between them, because all of that comes under the heading of what is good in this world. With regard to what is good in the hereafter, first and foremost among that is admittance to Paradise and what that includes of being safe from the greatest terror in the arena of judgement, an easy reckoning and other good things in the hereafter.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 1/558). And Allah knows best."
104,"She separated from her first husband by means of khul‘ without his consent and married another man, then she went back to her first husband","Question I was married to my husband islamically and civilly for 27 years and he had a substance abuse problem. We have two grown sons and one grand-daughter. One day I met a knowledgeable Muslim man on the internet as I was inquiring advice about my situation.. This person had written books and I came to trust him. I explained to him my plight and various spiritual experiences that I had. Thats when he told me about ""heart softeners"" a term I had not heard before. To make a long story short, he took to me emotionally and I him. He wanted me to leave (divorce) my husband and marry him. I went to my husband and honestly explained what had happened in detail and asked him for a divorce. He refused. The learned brother told me because my husband has a substance abuse problem and he (the learned brother) is a practicing muslim, he had more right for me to be his wife. To make a long story short again, at the behest of the new brother, I wrote my husband a letter releasing myself from him (khula) on the grounds of his intoxications. I did iddat and married the new brother. It did not work out with this new brother and we both agreed for divorce after two months. My ex-husband (so I thought) became aware of this and ardently pleaded for me to take him back. Explaining that he was in a long term live in program from the veterans administration and doing well. I told him I would consider. I eventually told him yes. He convinced me that we didn't have to go through an islamic ceremony because my divorce from him was not valid because I didn't give him anything for my freedom. He said he forgave me for my indescretion and hoped that Allah would forgive me also. At the time it sounded reasonable and we resumed married life without a ceremony. Now I find myself at unrest wondering am I in fact really married. Please advise me so that I can have no doubts and if there is anything that I need to do.","Praise be to Allah. The khul‘ that you did yourself is invalid and has no effect, because the woman does not have the right to annul the marriage contract, either by means of khul‘ or talaaq (divorce), just as she does not have the right to do the marriage contract. Rather the woman may ask to separate from her husband by means of khul‘ if there is good reason to do so, and if he accepts then he is the one who separates from her by means of khul‘ or talaaq. If he does not agree then she should refer the case to the shar‘i judge (qaadi) who will either force him to give a khul‘ or talaaq, or not. If the woman marries someone other than her first husband before having separated from him in a valid manner, either through talaaq or annulment of the marriage, or the husband’s death, then that (second) marriage contract is invalid, according to scholarly consensus. If she was aware that it was invalid then she is a zaaniyah (adulteress) who is subject to the hadd punishment, and so is he (the second husband). If she was not aware of that because she thought that she had the right to end the first marriage herself by means of khul‘, and that that could be valid, then she is excused because of her ignorance and the hadd punishment is not to be carried out on her, but her second marriage is also invalid and she has to leave him and observe ‘iddah, then go back to the first husband. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to invalid marriages, such as the marriage of a married woman or one who is observing ‘iddah and the like, if they were aware of what is halaal and what is haraam, then they are both guilty of zina and are thus subject to the hadd punishment, and any child born as a result is not to be attributed to the man. … and ‘iddah becomes obligatory once she has been alone with him; if he dies, she must ‘iddah and mourning. All of that is required as a precautionary measure for her sake. End quote from al-Mughni, 7/13 It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 8/123-124 The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to observe ‘iddah and any child born should be attributed to the man in the case of a marriage concerning which the madhhabs differ, once the marriage has been consummated, such as a marriage without witnesses or without a guardian, or marriage of a pilgrim in ihram during Hajj, or shighaar (quid-pro-quo marriage). The Hanbalis added that the same applies once it is proven that they have been alone together. They are also agreed that ‘iddah is required and the child is to be attributed to the man in the case of a marriage concerning which there is consensus that it is invalid once the marriage has been consummated, such as the marriage of any woman during her ‘iddah, the wife of another man and mahrams, if there is some doubt which would cause the hadd punishment to be waived, such as if the parties involved did not know that it is haraam, and because the basic principle according to the fuqaha’ is that in any case of marriage where the hadd punishment is to be waived, the child is to be attributed to the man. But if there is no doubt that would cause the hadd punishment to be waived, such as if the parties involved were aware that it is haraam, then the child is not to be attributed to the man according to the majority and also according to some of the Hanafi shaykhs, because when the hadd punishment becomes obligatory, attribution of the child to the man is not proven. And according to Abu Haneefah and some of the Hanafi shaykhs, attribution is proven because there is some doubt about the invalidity of the marriage contract. See also al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 29/339 See also the answer to question no. 171791 To sum up: In all cases the woman does not have the right to separate from her husband by means of khul‘ by herself, as happened in your case. Based on that, your second marriage to this liar and cheater is invalid and does not count. You have to observe ‘iddah following your separation from him, as in the case of a woman who is divorced by talaaq. Some of the scholars are of the view that in this case to prove that you are not pregnant from him, one menstrual cycle is sufficient. See ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘, 13/381-383 And Allah knows best."
105,Are gifts for weddings and other occasions like a debt that must be given to the giver on a subsequent special occasion?,"Question One of the customs that are widespread in the region in which I live is that on certain occasions – giving birth and weddings and so on – women give a small amount of money – such as five dinars – when their comes to congratulate a relative or neighbour, and the woman who receives the money is expected, on a subsequent happy occasion, to visit her (the giver) and either give her the same amount of money as she received – which means that they do not want to raise the level of friendship with her – or they give more – which is what usually happens. And it sometimes happens that the woman who gave the money criticises the other woman if she does not visit her and give back the money, and she may say that she has consumed her wealth unlawfully – there is no power and no strength except with Allah. What is the ruling on this interaction? Is the extra amount that I spoke of considered to be riba? For my part, I do not give this extra amount unless the woman is in need or is of high character. Please advise us, may Allah have mercy on you.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is nothing wrong with the custom followed by people in many countries, whereby they give gifts of money on such happy occasions, to one who is getting married or who has just had a baby, and so on, on the basis that the recipient will return the favour, giving the same amount or more, on another similar occasion. In fact this is a good thing, because it is helping with money and supporting others on such occasions when there is usually a need for money because of the expenses involved. This money, which in many countries is known as nuqoot, is a kind of loan that must be repaid on similar occasions, as customarily happens. In fact if the one who gave it needs it and asks for it, it is obligatory to give it back to him when he asks for it. Hence the one who gave it will always remember it and will keep a record of it in his private papers, in a separate section in his notebook that has to do with this type of loan. More than one of the fuqaha’ have stated that the nuqoot is a loan that must be repaid to the one who gave it, according to custom. The Shaafa‘i faqeeh Ibn Hajar al-Haytami was asked about the ruling on nuqoot, and replied: With regard to nuqoot, al-Azraqi and an-Najm al-Baalisi issued fatwas stating that it is a loan, so it must be returned to the one who gave it. Al-Balqeeni disagreed with them. The prevalent custom dictates that no one gives anything of this nature except with the aim that something similar should be given back to him, if he has a similar happy occasion. And the fact that this custom is clear and well established supports the first view. And Allah knows best. End quote. Al-Fataawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra, 3/265 Al-Mardaawi (a Hanbali scholar) said: Note: al-Kamaal ad-Dameeri said in his commentary on al-Minhaaj concerning the nuqoot which is customary at weddings: an-Najm al-Baalisi said: It is like a debt and the one who gave it may ask for it, and custom has nothing to do with that, because it is not consistent. End quote. al-Insaaf, 8/315 The point of quoting this text is that it rules that the nuqoot is a debt and it must be returned to the giver, even if custom is not consistent in this regard. But if custom is consistent and dictates that it should be returned or may be asked for, then undoubtedly the argument is stronger that it should be repaid and regarded as a debt. This is the basis on which al-Haytami reached his conclusion, as referred to above. Shaykh ‘Ulaysh al-Maaliki (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who held a wedding, and another man gave him a sum of money equivalent to the value of a sack of wheat, then two years later the giver asked for repayment. Should it be ruled that the recipient has to give back the value of this sack of wheat to the giver? He said in his response: Yes, it should be ruled that the recipient should pay back the equivalent of what was given to the giver, if it was stipulated or it is customary to do so. What matters is the value on the day he gives it back, not the day he asked for it, as it says in al-Kharashi and elsewhere. Ibn al-‘Attaar said: Whatever is given of a ram or similar gifts at the time of the wedding party, it should be given back to the giver if he asks to be rewarded later on, as is customary. It is an implicit deal that everyone should do that on the basis that he will be given something similar when he has a wedding … It may be understood from the phrase “when he has a wedding” that the giver is required to be patient until he has a wedding or similar event. And it says something similar in al-Burzuli. However, the apparent meaning of the words of at-Tataa’i is that he does not have to be patient, if that is the custom. He was followed in this view by al-Ujhoori and al-Kharashi. The recipient does not have to give a gift of more or less the same value unless he receives it in his hand, in which case he is obliged to give the value of the gift, based on its value on the day he received it. And the giver has the right to take back part of the value straight away and he does not have to wait until he has a wedding. End quote. In the following question it says: What do you say about someone who gives nuqoot to another person on the occasion of a wedding, then he asks for it back (without waiting for a subsequent wedding)? Does he have to respond to his request straightaway, and not wait until the giver has a wedding? Please answer. They replied: He should respond straightaway, because of the texts mentioned in the previous question. And Allah knows best. End quote from Fath al-‘Ali al-Maalik, 2/268 Secondly: With regard to the custom of giving something extra when returning the nuqoot, which (in turn) becomes a debt so that the (original) giver becomes a debtor upon receipt of this new nuqoot, what appears to be the case is that there is nothing wrong with this, in sha Allah, because this additional amount is customary; the original giver will not keep it in return for the loan that he gave (i.e., the nuqoot). Rather it is a kind of reward and help and treating one another fairly. Just as the first giver gave you a loan at your time of need, it is only fair that you should give him a loan at his time of need, and not only repay his loan. This is, in some ways, like a group of employees in which each one lends to another on the basis that the other will lend to him when it is his turn to have a loan. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And have in his mind no favour from anyone for which a reward is expected in return, Except only the desire to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High; He surely will be pleased (when he will enter Paradise)” [al-Layl :19-20]: What is meant is: his giving is not limited to those who did him favours before, because this is a kind of fair treatment that is required of all people when they deal with one another. It is like when you exchange items when buying and selling and renting. This is required of all people towards all other people; if there is no one whom he should reward for having done him a favour (as mentioned in the verse quoted above), then his giving is not subject to this equation and his giving is purely for the sake of his Lord Most High. Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah, 7/372. See also: al-Furoo‘ by Ibn Muflih, 4/638; al-Ikhtiyaaraat by Shaykh al-Islam, 183 Note: If the custom in a particular country is that what is given on such occasions is purely a gift, and the giver does not expect something similar in return and does not expect any material reward for it, then it is not a debt and the recipient does not have to keep a record of it and return it, although it is mustahabb to reward the giver for that. The same applies when the giver and recipient are closely related, and the one who gives does not expect something similar in return, such as if he is his father, brother or close friend, and he wants to give him a gift or help him with his wealth. And Allah knows best."

We do not know of there being anything wrong with that, but it should be said after starting with the salaam and after the prescribed response, if the person was greeted with salaam.

The Standing Committee was also asked: Here in Egypt we customarily greet people in the morning by saying Sabaah al-khayr ya fulaan (Good morning, O So and so). What is the ruling on this greeting in Islam? Answer: The greeting of Islam is al-salaamu ‘alaykum (peace be upon you). If the words wa rahmat-Allaah wa barakaatuhu (and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings) are added, that is better. If he says after that to the one whom he meets, Sabaah al-khayr (Good morning), for example, there is nothing wrong with that. But if the greeting upon meeting is limited to saying Sabaah al-khayr, without saying Al-salaamu alaykum, that is bad.

108,Permissibility of eating meat slaughtered by Christians and Jews,"Question I have read several articles on what foods are halal and what foods are haraam. But when I go to a restaurant I still [doubt] if what I am eating is halal. I know that the meat needs to be slaughtered in the name of Allah, and it shall be done by the people of the book. Currently in the United States, the Christians and the Jews don't follow the true Bible and the Torah. The Christians call Isa (may Allah be pleased with him) the son of God. Is the meat cut by these people halal, can it be eaten?","Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah).al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). The Christians and the Jews of the People of the Book in our times are indeed those People of the Book that are mentioned in the texts of shari'ah in the Qur'an and sunnah, and they are the kuffar (unbelievers) of the Jews and Christians that existed at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). They are the people of the corrupted Torah and corrputed Injeel, as evidenced by the fact that Allah (swt) addressed them and named them ""People of the Book"" despite their being kuffar and their books being corrupted, as indicated in the following interpretations of the meanings of the aayaat: Aala 'imran: 70: O People of the Book! why do you reject the Signs of Allah, of which you are (yourselves) witnesses? Al-maa'ida: 15: O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There has come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book. Al-hashr: 2: (in regards to the Battle of Bani al-Nadeer): It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces) These kuffar among the People of the Book have certain abrogating qualities distinguishing them from the rest of the kuffar, by virtue of the fact that they are recipients of heavenly guidance and are people of previously revealed divine bookseven though they corrupted themunlike the remainder of the kuffar who have neither a previous book nor messenger, such as the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the communists, and others. Because of this distinguishing quality, the shari'ah has specified special rulings particular to the People of the Book, and exceptions specific to them in some rulings, such as allowing marriage to the the chaste and virtuous (whether virgins or previously married) among their women and the permissibility of eating their slaughtered meat, as indicated in the following ayah (interpretation of the meaning): Maa'ida: 5 This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues The preceding discussion is in regards to the general ruling with respect to slaughtered meat of the People of the Book; as for the specifics, the slaughtered meat of People of the Book can be one of several cases: That he slaughters it via the known way specified by shari'ah and he speaks the name of Allah upon it. In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it. That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or electrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case there is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without properly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): "" and forbidden unto you is maita"" (al-Maa'ida:3) That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, such as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, since it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the ayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): ""Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow"" That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this case the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is permitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) ""and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you."" (al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would not be permisible. That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case likewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know whether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not. The Prophet replied ""Mention the name of Allah upon it and eat it."""
109,Is it permissible for the husband to ask his wife for her phone password if he is suspicious about her?,Question Is the Husband allowed to ask his Wife for her Computer and Phone Password? Especially if she is showing strong signs that she might be doing things which are Haraam or Impermissable?,"Praise be to Allah.The believer should think positively of his fellow Muslim and should assume the best, and interpret his affairs in a good way, and he should keep away from suspicion and negative thinking for which there is no basis, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Avoid much suspicions, indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not…” [al-Hujuraat 49:12]. It says in Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir (2/226): This verse indicates that it is emphatically prohibited to enquire into the private affairs of people and seek out their faults. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not spy on one another, do not compete with one another, do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not turn your backs with one another, and be, O slaves of Allah, brothers as He has commanded you.” And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O you who have paid lip service to faith but faith has not entered your hearts: do not backbite about the Muslims or seek out their faults, for whoever seeks out the faults of the Muslims, Allah will seek out his faults, and if Allah seeks out a person’s faults, He will expose him even if he is in the innermost part of his house.” It was said to Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him): What do you think if I tell you about al-Waleed ibn ‘Utbah and wine dripping from his beard? He said: We were forbidden to spy on one another; if he shows us anything amiss in his conduct, then we will take him to task for it. End quote. Based on that, the basic principle is that it is not permissible for a husband under ordinary circumstances to ask his wife for the password to her cell phone or computer, because this conduct implies doubt and suspicion, and it may sour the relationship between the spouses in a manner that may be difficult to put right. But if the husband has found indications or circumstantial evidence that points to his wife doing some things that are contrary to Islamic teaching, then there is no reason why he should not ask her for her password. In fact in that case he has the right to use trickery – without her knowledge – to find out about what is really going on. We have previously quoted a fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) concerning this issue. Please see fatwa no. 13318. For more information, please see also the answer to question no. 145815 And Allah knows best."
110,Is Sharing in a Sacrifice Permissible?,Question Is it permissible to share in a sacrifice and how many Muslims can share in a sacrifice?,"Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to share in a sacrifice? It is permissible to share in a sacrifice if it is a camel or a cow, but it is not permissible to share in a sheep. It is permissible for seven people to share one camel or cow. The Prophet’s Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) shared sacrifices: seven people would share a camel or a cow in Hajj and ‘Umrah. Muslim (1318) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “On the day of al-Hudaybiyah we offered the sacrifice with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a camel on behalf of seven and a cow on behalf of seven. According to another report, Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and we sacrificed a camel on behalf of seven and a cow on behalf of seven. Abu Dawud (2808) narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A cow on behalf of seven and a camel on behalf of seven.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) How many people can share in a sacrifice? Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: “These ahadith indicate that it is permissible to share in the sacrifice, but they are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to share in a sheep. These ahadith indicate that a camel is sufficient on behalf of seven people , and a cow is sufficient on behalf of seven people, and each of them takes the place of seven sheep. So if a muhrim is required to offer seven sacrifices –except in the case of the penalty for hunting – and he slaughters a camel or a cow, that is equivalent to them all.” The Standing Committee was asked about sharing in the sacrifice and they replied: “A camel or a cow is sufficient on behalf of seven people, whether they are all from one family or are from different families, and whether they are related to one another or not, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the Sahaabah to share a camel or a cow, one animal for every seven people, and he did not say anything more specific than that.” (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 11/401) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkaam al-Udhiyah: “One sheep is sufficient for one person, and one-seventh of a camel or cow is sufficient for what one sheep is sufficient for.” For more about sharing in a sacrifice, see these answers: 45771 , 45767 , 146159 , 96741 , and 111887 .

111,Ruling on items confiscated from students who break the rules,"Question What is the ruling on items confiscated from students for breaking the rules, such as (pumpkin or sunflower etc) seeds, chewing gum, masbahahs, rings and so on? I confiscate (pumpkin or sunflower etc) seeds and chewing gum and throw them in the trash. As for masbahahs and rings, I hand them over to the administration, but the administration says: Give them back so that we will owe them nothing. To sum up, the question is: what is the ruling on items confiscated from students in such cases?.","Praise be to Allah. If these students have been informed about the things which they are not allowed to use in class or bring to school and have been told that whoever breaks the rule will have it confiscated from him, it is permissible to punish those who break the rules by confiscating them. If they are items of little value, such as pumpkin seeds, it is permissible to dispose of them, but if they are valuable items they should be returned to the student or his guardian at the end of the day or at the end of the school year, according to whatever the school thinks is best. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for the teacher to take things from some students which may be valuable, with which they were playing in class during the lesson, and give them to the school? He replied: That is based on the issue of whether it is permissible to punish by taking wealth or property. Some of the scholars say that it is not permissible to punish by taking wealth or property in any case except what is mentioned in the texts. Some of them say that punishing by taking wealth or property is permissible and this is the more correct view. But if the students have something that they are playing with and he has warned them, for example by writing on the blackboard or posting a notice, that if anyone brings something and plays with it, it will be confiscated, then in that case he may confiscate it, but if it is something valuable and the student is poor - for example -- then it should be kept safely at the school, and at the end of the year it should be given to the student or his guardian.

112,Definition of the beard and ruling on shaving the hair that grows on the neck,"Question Is a man allowed to shave the hair that is on the neck right below the ear lobe, to make the beard not stick out so much .","Praise be to Allah. The beard is the hair that grows on the cheeks and chin. Ibn Manzoor said quoting from Ibn Sayyidih: Lihyah (beard) includes the hair that grows on the cheeks and the chin. Lisaan al-‘Arab, 15/243 The hair that grows on the bones that are level with the channel of the ear – the cheekbones – is part of the beard and it is not permissible to pluck it or shave it. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about what is meant by the beard. He replied: The extent of the beard is from the cheekbones, level with the channel of the ears, until the bottom of the face. It includes the hair that grows on the cheeks. It says in al-Qaamoos al-Muheet (p. 387): Lihyah (beard) is the hair of the cheeks and chin. Based on this, the one who says that the hair that grows on the cheeks is not part of the beard must bring proof of that. Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 11/question no. 49 He (may Allaah have mercy on him) was also asked: Are the cheeks part of the beard? He replied: Yes, the cheeks are part of the beard, because this is what is implied by the language in which sharee’ah came. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’aan in order that you may understand” [Yoosuf 12:2] “He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book (this Qur’aan, Islamic laws and Islamic jurisprudence) and Al‑Hikmah (As‑Sunnah)” [al-Jumu’ah 62:2] Hence it is known that the meanings brought in the Qur’aan and Sunnah are the meanings indicated by the Arabic language, but if there is a particular shar’i meaning it should be interpreted in that manner. For example, salaah in Arabic means supplication (as in du’aa’), but in shar’i terminology it refers to the specific, well known act of worship (prayer), so when it is mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, it is to be understood in the shar’i sense, unless there is any indication to the contrary. Based on this, Islam does not ascribe any particular shar’i meaning to the word lihyah (beard), so it is to be understood in its linguistic sense, and in Arabic it refers to the hair that grows on the cheeks and chin, from the cheekbone that is level with the channel of the ears to the jawbone. It says in al-Qamoos: Lihyah (beard) is the hair of the cheeks and chin. Similarly it also says in Fath al-Baari, p. 35; vol. 10, al-Salafiyyah edition: It is a name for that which grows on the cheeks and chin. Thus it is clear that the cheeks are part of the beard, and the believer must be patient in obeying Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), even if it is strange among his own race or people. Glad tidings to the strangers. It should be noted that truth is weighed according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); it is not weighed according to what people do that goes against the Qur’aan and Sunnah. We ask Allaah to make us and our Muslim brothers steadfast in adhering to the truth. Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 11/question no 50. As for the hair that grows on the neck, it is not part of the beard. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) stated that there is nothing wrong with removing hair that is beneath the pharynx, as it says in al-Insaaf (1/250), because it is not part of the beard. Shaykh Muhammad al-Safareeni said: The reliable point of view, as it says in al-Iqnaa’ and elsewhere, is that it is not makrooh to remove hair that is beneath the pharynx. Ghidha’ al-Albaab Sharh Manzoomat al-Adaab, 1/433 See also question no. 9037 And Allaah knows best."
113,Weeping for Fear of Allah,Question I am a man and I never cry. How can I make my eyes weep for fear of Allah in accordance with the hadeeth: “Two eyes that will never be touched by the Fire” in which it mentions “The eye that weeps for fear of Allah”? May Allah reward you with good.,"Praise be to Allah. Undoubtedly your feelings of regret for missing out on this blessing is a very good sign. You should note that the Muslim can accustom himself to weep for fear of Allah, by doing the following: 1 – Making yourself feel fear of Allah. This weeping is the fruit of beneficial knowledge, as al-Qurtubi says in his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And they fall down on their faces weeping” [17:109] This is an eloquent description of them and praise for them. It is the duty of everyone who acquires knowledge to reach this level, so that when he hears the Quran he is filled with fear and humility. In Musnad al-Daarimi it is narrated from Abu Muhammad that al-Taymi said: Whoever is given knowledge and does not weep, he deserves not to have any knowledge, because Allah has described those who have knowledge; then he recited this verse. Al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam il-Qur’aan, 10/341-342. 2 – Reading the Quran and pondering its meanings Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad to them): Believe in it (the Quran) or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration. And they say: Glory be to our Lord! Truly, the Promise of our Lord must be fulfilled. And they fall down on their faces weeping and it increases their humility” [17:107-109] “Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nooh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the Verses of the Most Gracious (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate and weeping” [19:58] It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me: “Recite the Quran to me.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, shall I recite it to you when it was revealed to you?” He said: “I like to hear it from someone else.” So I recited Soorat al-Nisa’ to him, and when I reached this verse – “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people?” [4:41] – he said: “That is enough for now.” I turned to him and saw his eyes were streaming with tears. Narrated by al-Bukhari andMuslim. 3 – Knowing the greatness of the reward for weeping, especially when one is alone. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah said: “A man who weeps for fear of Allah will not enter Hell until the milk goes back into the udder, and dust produced (when fighting) for the sake of Allah and the smoke of Hell will never coexist.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasaa’i. “until the milk goes back into the udder” is a metaphor for it being impossible, as in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle” [7:40]. Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. And it was narrated that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are seven whom Allah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade but His: a just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two people who love one another for the sake of Allah, meeting and parting on that basis; a man who is called (to commit sin) by a woman of high status and great beauty and he says, ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand is doing; and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone and his eyes flow with tears.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. Weeping when alone is singled out because being alone is a time when the heart tends to become harder and there is a stronger motive to commit sin, and it is farthest removed from the possibility of showing off. So if a person strives to do this, and makes himself feel the greatness and might of Allah, and his eyes flow with tears, then he deserves to be beneath the shade of the Throne of the Most Merciful on the Day when there will be no shade but His shade. 4 – Thinking about your situation and your boldness in committing sin, and fearing to meet Allah in such a state. One of the righteous people used to weep night and day, and something was said to him about that. He said: “I am afraid that Allah will see me committing sin and will say: ‘Go away from Me for I am angry with you.’” Hence Sufyan used to weep and say: “I am afraid that my faith will be taken away at the moment of death.” Isma’il ibn Zakariya described Habeeb ibn Muhammad, who was a neighbour of his. He said: “Every evening I heard him weeping and every morning I heard him weeping, so I went to his wife and said: ‘What is the matter with him? He weeps in the evening and he weeps in the morning!’ She said to me: ‘By Allah, when evening comes he fears that he will not live till morning and when morning comes he fears that he will not live till evening.’” The salaf (righteous predecessors) used to weep and grieve a great deal. When Yazeed al-Raqaashi was criticized for weeping a great deal and it was said to him, “If the Fire had been created exclusively for you, you would not weep more than this,” he said: “Has the Fire been created for anyone other than me and my companions and brothers among the jinn and mankind?” When ‘Ata’ al-Sulaymi was asked: “What is this grief?” he said: “Woe to you! Death is close at hand, the grave is my house, on the Day of Resurrection I will stand and my path is over a bridge across Hell, and I do not know what will become of me.” Faddalah ibn Sayfi used to weep a great deal. A man entered upon him when he was weeping and said to his wife: “What is the matter with him?” She said: “He says that he wants to undertake a long journey and he does not have proper provision for it.” One night al-Hasan woke up weeping, and he disturbed the other people in the house with his weeping. They asked him what was the matter and he said: “I remembered a sin that I committed and I wept.” It was narrated that Tameem al-Daari (may Allah be pleased with him) recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah- Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds” [45:21] and he started repeating it and weeping until morning came. Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) used to weep intensely, and it was said to him: “Why are you weeping?” He said: “I do not know what is ahead of me – Divine pleasure or divine wrath.” Sa’d ibn al-Akhram said: I was walking with Ibn Mas’ood and he passed by the blacksmiths, who had brought a piece of iron out of the fire. He stood and looked at the molten iron and wept. 5 – Making yourself feel regret and feeling that you have fallen short in your duties towards Allah. The tears of the repentant at night quenches thirst and cures sickness, as the Shaykh of the Mufassireen (exegetists), Abu Ja’far al-Tabari, said in his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Do you then wonder at this recitation (the Quran)? And you laugh at it and weep not” [53:59-60] Do not weep at the warnings contained therein to those who disobey Allah, when you are people who commit sin, “Wasting your (precious) lifetime in pastime and amusements (singing)” [53:61] – you are heedless of the lessons and reminders contained therein, turning away from its verses. Jaami’ al-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weel Aayi al-Qur’aan, 27/82. 6 – Weeping out of fear of a bad end. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by al-Hijr (the land of the people of Thamood) he said: “Do not enter the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, lest what befell them befall you, unless you are weeping.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) covered his head and walked quickly until he had left the valley. Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Nawawi included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled “Weeping and feeling fear when passing by the graves of the wrongdoers and the places where they were killed, and expressing one's need of Allah, and being careful not to be negligent in that.” Riyadh al-Saliheen. 7 – Listening to moving speeches and lectures that will soften the heart. It was narrated that al-‘Irbad ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him), who was one of those who used to weep, said: “The Messenger of Allah delivered a deeply moving speech at which our eyes began to overflow and our hearts melted.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood and Ibn Maajah. May Allah help us and you to do that which our Lord loves and is pleased with him."
114,If a woman dies and leaves behind full siblings or half siblings through the mother,"Question My sister died, she was not married, and our parents have passed away before she died. We are 3 sister and 3 brothers, who were the heirs of her property, We distributed her wealth among 6 of us, the brothers got 2 shares and sisters got one, Recently my brother sold a piece of land and said that my sister (who died) also had a share in it so he distributed her share again in the same manner. This is what we knew about the inheritance, But I read in surah Anisa about the inheritance of ‘Kalaala’ and according to my understanding of the verse # 12 only one third should have been distributed. Now my question is, if what we did was not correct what we should do, I am realy worried as I was managing her things. Other siblings are not concerned, and also it has been more than 4 years that we distributed the wealth. I will be very grateful please advice me.","Praise be to Allah. If you are full siblings of the deceased or siblings through the father only, then the division of the estate that was done is correct and there is nothing wrong with it. But if you are siblings through the mother only, then there is the issue of kalaalah, which may be explained as follows: 1.If a person dies and leaves behind full siblings, then the estate is to be divided among them with each male getting the share of two females. There is consensus among the scholars on this. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the words of Allah at the end of Soorat al-Nisa’ (interpretation of the meaning): “if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the share of the female” [al-Nisa’ 4:176], there is no difference of opinion among the earlier and later Muslim scholars that inheritance of siblings through the mother only is not like this. Therefore they are unanimously agreed that the siblings mentioned in this verse are siblings of the deceased through the father and mother (i.e., full siblings) or through the father only. End quote from al-Tamheed, 5/200. See also al-Mughni, 6/162 2.If a person dies and has no father or child, and he leaves siblings through the mother, this is a case of kalaalah. If there is only one brother through the mother, he gets one sixth. If there are more than one, they get one third, which is divided equally between males and females. This is one of the cases in which the share of the female is like that of the male. If we assume that you are siblings of the deceased through the mother only – and you are not full siblings – then you take one third of the estate and divide it among you equally. If she had no other heir, then the rest of the estate comes to you, so the estate comes to you through allocated shares and by default, and it is to be shared equally among you.

115,The Rifaa’is who stab themselves with knives but are not affected by it,"Question What is your opinion of those who call themselves daraaweesh (pl. of darweesh or “dervish”) and stab themselves with knives, daggers, etc? Whilst they do that, before they say “Ya Allaah (O Allaah)”, they say, “Ya Rifaa’i (O Rifaa’i).” What is the shar’i view of this? Is there any evidence (daleel) for what they do? May Allaah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allah.They are liars and cheats. There is no basis for their actions. In fact they are tricksters who use things to deceive the people so that the people will think that they are stabbing themselves when that is not really the case. It is a trick whereby they deceive the eye and bewitch people. This is like what Allaah said about the sorcerers of Pharaoh, that they were trying to frighten the people and that they bewitched their eyes. The point is that it is not permissible to believe in this kind of people – evildoers and deceivers – who have no basis for what they do. They are liars and tricksters who deceive people. When they call upon al-Rifaa’i, or anybody else, this is shirk akbar (major shirk), as is the case of one who says “O Rifaa’i” or “O Messenger of Allaah, grant us victory: or “intercede for us” or “O ‘Ali” or “O Seedi” or “O Husayn” or “Ya Seedi al-Badawi” and so on. All of that is shirk akbar and it is all worship of people or things other than Allaah. All of that is like the actions of those who worship graves, and those who worshipped al-Laat and al-‘Uzza and their ilk. It is shirk akbar – we seek refuge in Allaah from that. When these people stab themselves with daggers and knives, it is trickery and deception which has no basis; by doing this they are liars and evildoers. The authorities – if there are Muslim rulers in their countries – have to put a stop to this, and they must punish them and discipline them until they repent from their evil actions."
116,"If there is an error in the moon sighting, and it is proven that we did not fast on one day of Ramadan, do we have to make it up?","Question What should we do if the state made a mistake with regard to the beginning and end of Ramadan, and it is proven that we missed one day of Ramadan – do we have to make it up, or what?","Praise be to Allah.If it is proven by shar‘i methods that the Muslims made a mistake with regard to defining the beginning or end of Ramadan, then they must make up for this mistake and make up the day of Ramadan that they did not fast. Such a mistake may be established by a number of shar‘i methods, including the following: 1. If they completed Sha‘baan with thirty days, then a trustworthy person comes and testifies that he saw the new moon on the night before the thirtieth of Sha‘baan, and the judge accepts his testimony. 2. If they fasted Ramadan with twenty-eight days, then they saw the new moon of Shawwaal. If that is proven, then they must make up one day for the day concerning which they were mistaken. Shaykh ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is proven in many saheeh hadiths from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that the month cannot be less than twenty-nine days. If it is proven by means of shar‘i evidence that Shawwaal has begun, when the Muslims have only fasted twenty-eight days, then this means that they did not fast the first day of Ramadan, so they must make it up, because it is not possible for a month to have twenty-eight days; rather it can only be twenty-nine or thirty days. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in vol. 25 of his Fataawa (p. 154-155) that this happened during the time of ‘Ali; they fasted twenty-eight days. He ordered them to fast the day that they had missed, and to complete the month as twenty-nine days. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (15/158). This happened in the land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries in 1404 AH, and the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas issued a fatwa stating that it was obligatory to make up the day which they had not fasted at the beginning of Ramadan. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah li’l-Iftaa’ (10/122): The sighting of the new moon for Ramadan 1404 AH was not proven according to shar‘i conditions by the responsible parties in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia except on the night before the Thursday, so they issued instructions to complete Sha‘baan as thirty days, in accordance with the saheeh hadiths to that effect, and announced that Ramadan would begin that year on the Thursday. Then they looked for the new moon of Shawwaal 1404 AH and its sighting was proven by them on the night before the Friday. So they announced that Eid al-Fitr 1404 would be on the Friday. Thus they fasted twenty-eight days, and the lunar month cannot be twenty-eight days; rather it can only be twenty-nine days sometimes and thirty sometimes, as is proven in the saheeh hadith. This mistake proved that the beginning of Ramadan had been delayed, so they announced that and instructed people to make up the day that they had not fasted at the beginning of the month, so as to discharge their duty and do what is right. End quote. The Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ood, Shaykh ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baaz But if the mistake cannot be proven by shar‘i means; rather it was based on astronomical calculations or on what some people thought, then this is of no significance and shar‘i rulings cannot be based on it. And Allah knows best."
117,What should he do if he heard the adhaan for Fajr and was having intercourse with his wife and did not withdraw?,"Question My husband had intercourse with me a few minutes before the adhaan for Fajr, thinking that there was still some time to go before the adhaan, and he did not double check even though I insisted that he do so. The adhaan for Fajr was given whilst we were having intercourse, and with my efforts to stop intercourse, he left me and completed it on his own (like the secret habit), because he thought that it is permissible to complete intercourse once started. What is the ruling for him and for me?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is obligatory to stop eating, drinking, having intercourse and doing anything else that may break the fast once the true dawn breaks, until the sun sets, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. So if someone becomes certain that the true dawn has broken, he must stop [eating], and if he has something in his mouth, he must spit it out. If the true dawn breaks whilst he is having intercourse and he withdraws immediately, his fast is valid and he does not have to do anything. It is not permissible for him to continue having intercourse after becoming aware that dawn has broken; if he continues, then he invalidates his fast – and there is no scholarly disagreement concerning that – and he must make up that day and also offer expiation. If his wife willingly went along with him, then she is subject to the same obligations as him: she must make up that fast and also offer expiation. If she refuses and he forces her to do that, then her fast is valid, and she does not have to do anything. See the answers to questions no. 124290 and 106532. Secondly: There are signs of the true dawn by which it is known; the mu’adhdhins must make efforts to find the correct time. Most mu’adhdhins nowadays rely on clocks and timetables, not on actually seeing the dawn, and they are not able to see it in cities because cities are filled with lights. The adhaan that is based on clocks and timetables is not regarded as being certain with regard to the break of dawn, because of the well-known difference of opinion concerning the accuracy of these timetables, and the well-known view of more than one scholar which says that the adhaan that is based on timetables happens before the proper time; the extent of this error varies from one timetable to another. Based on that, if someone eats or has intercourse at that time, thinking that there is still part of the night left, his fast is valid, because he was not certain that dawn had broken, especially if that happened shortly after the adhaan. Undoubtedly what the Muslim who is honest with himself should do is be cautious with regard to matters of worship, and not be like the one who grazes his flock around a sanctuary, and soon transgresses onto it, in accordance with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt” and “Whoever keeps away from dubious matters will have protected his faith and his honour.” What this implies is that he should stop eating, drinking, having intercourse, and doing anything else that breaks the fast, as soon as he hears the adhaan, even if he thinks that there is an error in the timetable, especially in the case of obligatory fasts. Making sure that acts of worship are correct and valid, and being keen to uphold them, is an important matter; the difference of opinion concerning timetables is something that is a well-known thorny issue. No one needs to put himself in such a situation; rather the wise person will be cautious with regard to his fast, and will stop eating, drinking and so on when he hears the adhaan; and he will be cautious with regard to his prayer, and will delay it until he knows for sure that the true dawn has broken. Please see the answer to question no. 66202. Conclusion: If the mu’adhdhins in your country rely on sighting the dawn for giving the adhaan – not on clocks and timetables, then it is obligatory to stop having intercourse when hearing the adhaan. If a person does not stop immediately, at that exact moment, then he has spoiled his fast, and he must make up the fast and offer expiation, even if he does not ejaculate. If he withdraws but continues after that to engage in some kind of intimacy other than vaginal intercourse until he ejaculates, then he has spoiled his fast and must make up that day, because he spoiled his fast by ejaculating, but he does not have to offer expiation, because expiation is required in the case of intercourse, but he stopped having intercourse when he heard the adhaan. Please see the answer to question no. 71213. If the mu’adhdhins rely on clocks and timetables, and he continued to have intercourse after hearing the adhaan for a short while during which he was not certain that dawn had broken, then his fast is valid, in sha Allah, but it would have been better to err on the side of caution regarding his fast. And Allah knows best."
118,Can Women Go to Graveyards in Islam?,"Question My aunt’s father died and she visited his grave once. She wants to visit it again, but she has heard a hadith which means that women are forbidden to visit graves. Is this hadith sahih, and if it is sahih, is she guilty of a sin for which expiation is required?","Praise be to Allah.Can Muslim women visit graves? The correct view is that it is not allowed for women to visit graves , because of the hadith mentioned. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. Women should stop visiting graves . Visiting graves out of ignorance The woman who visited a grave out of ignorance (of this ruling) is not to blame, but she should not do it again. If she does so, she has to repent and seek forgiveness, and repentance cancels out whatever came before. Who can visit grave? Visiting graves is only for men. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Visit graves, for they will remind you of the Hereafter.” Why was visiting graves not allowed at the beginning of Islam? At the beginning of Islam, visiting graves was not allowed for men and women alike, because the Muslims were new in Islam and came from a background where grave-worship and attachment to the dead were widespread. So they were forbidden to visit graves as a preventative measure, to avoid evil and prevent shirk. Once Islam was well-established and they understood Islam, Allah prescribed visiting the graves because of the lessons and reminders of death and the Hereafter involved in that, and so that they could make du`a for the deceased and pray for mercy for them. Why did Allah forbid women to visit graves? Then Allah forbade women to do that – according to the most correct of the two scholarly opinions – because they may present a temptation to men and even to themselves, and because they have little patience and they get too upset. So by His mercy and kindness towards them, Allah forbade them to visit graves. This is also a form of kindness towards the men, because if they were all to gather at the grave, this might cause fitnah. So by His mercy, Allah forbade women to visit graves. Can women offer funeral prayers? But with regard to the prayer (women praying the funeral prayer ), there is nothing wrong with that. Women may join the funeral prayer. The prohibition applies only to visiting the graves. Women should not visit graves according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of the hadiths which indicate that that is forbidden. She does not have to offer any expiation; all she has to do is to repent to Allah sincerely. And Allah knows best."
119,She is travelling far away and fears fitnah (temptation) for herself,"Question I am a Muslim girl living alone in a kaafir land, after my family refused everyone who came to propose marriage to me and I suffered a great deal. I am trying to avoid temptation and maintain my religious commitment but four years of being away from my homeland has made me sick and I am suffering from psychological problems, because of my regret for having travelled without a mahram. I cannot go back to my homeland and my family are not letting me keep chaste by getting married. Even though I still wear hijab and have taken part in da’wah, I have grown weak and have almost fallen into zina, and from there my situation got worse and worse. I thought of suicide but knowing how serious this crime is prevented me from doing anything. I travelled for my work and met a young man from my country who seems to be pure and committed, and he lives in the same city where I am studying. I cried throughout the trip and prayed to Allaah that I would die on the trip, because I felt that I had grown weak and had lost the ability to resist. When I returned from the trip I felt that something had changed in me. And I renewed my trust in Allaah and cut off all ties with those who had corrupted me. I announced it as repentance that I had been unable to do for a long time. I prayed to Allaah asking Him for guidance (istikhaarah) and asking that this young man would be my husband. By Allaah, this young man continued to get in touch with me asking me to marry him on the basis that I would adhere to sharee’ah. I told my family but they refused again and upset me because they are not thinking of what I am suffering. By Allaah, I do not want to disobey them, but they are putting me under unbearable pressure. I thought of asking the imam to be my wali (guardian), because this young man is one of the best I have seen in terms of religious commitment and good character. By Allaah, I only want to keep myself chaste for the sake of Allaah. What should Ido? My second question is: I feel guilty with this young man because of my past sins. Should I tell him of what I did in the past even though I have repented sincerely? I am in touch with this man by phone to work things out, and Allaah is witness that he has never transgressed the limits with me. Please advise me, may Allaah reward you, for my heart is breaking.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: We ask Allaah, may He be exalted, to relieve your distress and worry and to protect you from falling into the way that leads to doom and destruction and slipping into sin, for He is able to do whatever He wills. Listen to this divine call (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53] Listen to the call of Allaah to His believing slaves (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Turn to Allaah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)” [al-Tahreem 66:8] Allaah accepts the repentance of His slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do” [al-Shoora 42:25] What is it that made you leave your family and travel to a kaafir land and live there? No one can trust himself even in a Muslim country because there are so many doubts and whims and desires! So how about in a land where anything goes, and where the doors to sin are open wide? Because of that, and because of his keenness to protect his ummah from falling into the like of that which you have fallen into – we ask Allaah to keep you safe – the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade living among the kuffaar and settling in their lands. He said: “I disavow myself of any Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (2645) and al-Tirmidhi (1604); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (1207). Settling in a kaafir country is unhealthy and hard, a life of anxiety and stress. Their life – I mean the people of that land – is an unbearable hell, by their own admission, because they have lost spiritual discipline and the connection with God; their life has become purely materialistic. Mental illness has become widespread among them, and they have resorted, in many cases, to exiting from this life by means of suicide. Secondly: Our advice to you is to look for the reasons why your family took this attitude towards you and refused everyone who came to propose marriage to you. Try to find out what it is and try to do something about it, so that you will be able to resolve the matter and come up with an appropriate solution so that you will be able to reconcile with your family. If that is not possible and things remain as they are, and you find out that the reasons that have come between you and your family are not legitimate, then in that case your guardian is the ruler or the shar’i qaadi (judge). Since you are living in a country where there is no Islamic legal system and it is not a Muslim country, there is nothing wrong with the director of one of the Islamic centres or the imam of one of the mosques acting as your wali. See the answer to question no. 7989. Thirdly: If you feel that you have sinned because of what you have done in the past, and have turned back to Allaah and repented sincerely, meaning that you regret what you did and resolve not to go back to it, and give up the sin, and ask for forgiveness, and do a lot of good deeds, that will make up for what you did and will purify you. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allaah), then verily, Allaah will pardon him (accept his repentance). Verily, Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Maa'idah 5:39] “And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)” [Ta-Ha 20:82] “And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance” [al-Furqaan 25:71] Whoever turns away from sin and turns to his Lord and submits to Him, Allaah will accept his repentance and make the consequences good, and He will make him one of those who inherit Paradise. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As‑Salât (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salât (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell. 60. Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allaah and His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught” [Maryam 19:59-60] Repentance opens a new door from which he may start a new life, filled with faith, ihsaan and hope. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who repents is like one who did not sin.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (4250); classed as hasan by al-Albaani. I advise you not to tell him about that, because after repenting it is as if it never happened. Start a new life with him, filled with hope, love and happiness, and surrounded with worship, piety and righteousness, following true guidance. Our advice to you is to hasten to marry this young man, because his getting in touch with you and forming a relationship before marriage is haraam, and may open the door to temptation. We ask Allaah to protect us from slipping. And Allaah knows best."
120,Why isn’t the puffer for asthma regarded as breaking the fast?,Question I would like a detailed answer: why isn’t the puffer that is used by people who have asthma regarded as breaking the fast?.,"Praise be to Allah.The puffer is a container in which there is a liquid medicine composed of three things: chemical substances (medical preparation), water and oxygen. When pressure is applied to the puffer, the medicine comes out in the form of a mist. If the patient takes a deep breath in when applying pressure to the puffer, this mist enters the airway (trachea), but some of it remains in the pharynx, and a very small amount of it may enter the oesophagus. Some contemporary scholars are of the view that using a puffer invalidates the fast. They said: Because the contents of the puffer may reach the stomach via the mouth, so it breaks the fast. But most contemporary scholars are of the view that using this puffer does not break the fast, and this view is the correct one. They quoted a number of things as evidence for this: 1. The basic principle is that the fast remains valid, and this fact cannot be altered except when there is certain proof. Whether part of the mist from the puffer reaches the stomach is something uncertain: it may enter the stomach or it may not, because the basic principle is that this substance goes to the respiratory system, but some of it may enter the stomach. With this uncertainty we cannot say that it invalidates the fast. This is the answer to the evidence for the first opinion. 2. Assuming that some of this medicine does actually enter the stomach, it is forgiven, and does not invalidate the fast, by analogy with rinsing the mouth and using the miswaak. With regard to rinsing the mouth: when the fasting person rinses his mouth, some of that water remains in his mouth, and some of that water may go down to the stomach. Hence if he rinses his mouth with water in which there is a radioactive substance, that radioactive substance will appear in his stomach after a while, which confirms that some of the water used for rinsing the mouth does go down into the stomach. But this part that goes down into the stomach is a very small amount, which is overlooked in sharee’ah. The ruling is that the fast is still valid if one rinses the mouth. The amount of medicine from a puffer that reaches the stomach – if any – is smaller than the amount of water that reaches the stomach when one rinses the mouth, so it is more likely that it does not break the fast. As for the siwaak, it contains a substance that dissolves in the saliva and goes down into the pharynx, and then to the stomach. But Islam overlooks this, and does not regard it as invalidating the fast, because it is a small amount and is not intentional. Similarly the part that may go down into the stomach from the puffer is small, and the patient does not intend for it to enter the stomach, so it does not break the fast, by analogy with the miswaak. Thus the strength of the second view is apparent. This is the view favoured by our contemporary scholars: Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-‘Uthaymeen, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen, and the scholars of the Standing Committee. We have quoted some of their fatwas concerning this in the answer to question no. 37650. See: Majallat al-Fiqh al-Islami (vol. 10, in which there are a number of articles about modern things that break the fast); Muftiraat al-Siyaam al-Mu’aasirah, by Dr. Ahmad al-Khaleel, p. 33-38."
121,Ruling on working in a bank which acts as an intermediary between customers and companies which give loans with interest,"Question He got an employment offer from an online bank that helps freelancers, small scale businesses have a bank account. They do not give any loans as such but do partner with other lending companies if their users want loans. But they themselves do not deal in Loans with interest. Is it permissible to work as a Manager in such kind of a company?","Praise be to Allah.If the bank helps anyone who wants to take out a loan from companies which lend with interest, then working in the bank is haram, because it is helping with something that is haram. Allah, may He be exalted, says: {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty} [Al-Ma’idah 5:2]. Muslim (1598) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same. Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The scribe and the witness are included here, because they help in this sin and participate in it.""(Ikmal al-Mu‘allim 5/283). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This clearly indicates that it is haram to write down the contact between the two who deal in riba, and to act as a witness to that transaction. It also indicates that it is haram to help in falsehood. End quote from Sharh Muslim (11/26). Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than that. And Allah knows best."
122,How to deal with sihr (magic/witchcraft),Question What is the way to deal with sihr (magic/witchcraft)?,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever is affected by sihr should not treat it with sihr, because evil cannot be removed by evil, and kufr cannot be removed by kufr. Evil is removed by good. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about al-nushrah (treating sihr with sihr), he said: “This is the work of the Shaytan.” Nushrah means removing sihr from a person who has been affected by it by using more sihr. But if it is treated by means of the Quran and permissible medicines or good ruqyahs, there is nothing wrong with that, but treating it with sihr is not permitted, as previously stated, because sihr means worshipping the shayateen (devils). The saahir (magician, practitioner of witchcraft) does sihr or learns sihr only after worshipping and serving the shayateen, and drawing close to them by means of the things that they like. After that, they teach him the means of sihr. But, praise be to Allah, there is no reason why the person who has been affected by sihr should not be treated by means of reciting Quran and the prayers for refuge with Allah that are prescribed in sharee’ah, and permissible medicines, just as patients with all kinds of sicknesses are treated by doctors. The patient does not necessarily recover, because not every sick person does recover. A sick patient might be treated and then recover if his appointed time (of death) has not yet arrived, or he may not recover and may die from this sickness, even though he may be been seen by the most skilled physicians and knowledgeable doctors. When the appointed time of death comes, no medicine or treatment will be of any avail, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And Allah grants respite to none when his appointed time (death) comes” [al-Munaafiqoon 63:11] Medical treatment is of benefit when the appointed time has not yet come, and Allah decrees that His slave should be healed. The same applies in the case of one who has been affected by sihr; Allah may decree that he should recover, or He may not decree that, as a test and a trial, or for other reasons which are known to Allah. Among those reasons may be the fact that the one who is treating him does not have the right treatment for this problem. It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For every disease there is a medicine, and if that medicine is applied to the disease, he will recover by Allah’s Leave.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down the cure; the one who knows it knows it and the one who does not know it does not know it.” Among the treatments prescribed in sharee’ah is the treatment of sihr with recitation of the Quran. The greatest soorah in the Quran, which is al-Faatihah, should be recited over the person who has been affected by sihr. This should be repeated several times. If it is recited by a believing, righteous reader who knows that everything is subject to the will and decree of Allah, that Allah is in control of all things, that when He says to a thing ‘Be!’ it is, if the reciting is based on faith, taqwa and sincerity, and is repeated several times, then the sihr may be removed and the person may recover by Allah’s Leave. Some of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) passed by some Bedouins whose shaykh, i.e., their leader, had been bitten. They had done everything they could but he had not gotten better. They said to one of the Sahaabah, “Is there any raaqi (one who performs ruqyah) among you?” They said, “Yes.” So one of them recited Soorat al-Faatihah over him, and he immediately got up full of energy as if nothing had happened; Allah healed him of the ill-effects of that snakebite. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah so long as it does not involve shirk.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed ruqyah and had it performed for him. There is a lot of good in ruqyah, and a great deal of benefit. Al-Faatihah, Aayat al-Kursiy, “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad”, al-Mi’wadhatayn and other aayahs may be recited over the person who has been affected by sihr, as well as good du’aa’s narrated in the ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the du’aa’ he said when he performed ruqyah for a sick person and said, “Allahumma Rabb al-naas, adhhib il-ba’s, washfi anta al-Shaafi laa shifaa’a illa shifaa’uka shifaa’an laa yughaadir saqaman (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the harm and heal him, for You are the Healer and there is no healing except Your healing, with a healing which does not leave any disease behind).” This may be repeated three times or more. And it was also narrated from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Jibreel (peace be upon him) performed ruqyah for him and said three times: “Bismillaah arqeeka min kulli shay’in yu’dheeka, wa min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin haasid Allah yashfeek, bismillaah arqeek (In the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from every thing that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).” This is a great ruqyah which was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is prescribed to perform ruqyah for the one who has been bitten or stung, and the one who has been affected by sihr, and the one who is sick. There is nothing wrong with performing ruqyah for one who is sick or has been affected by sihr or bitten or stung, by reciting good du’aa’s, even if they were not transmitted from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so long as they do not contain anything that is haraam, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah so long as it does not involve shirk.” Allah may heal the sick person and the person affected by sihr, and others, without any ruqyah and without any action on the part of other people, because He is Able to do all things, and He is Wise in all that He does. Allah says in His Holy Book: “Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is!”[Yaa-Seen 36:82] To Him be praise and thanks for all that He wills and decrees, for He is wise in all that He does. The sick person may not be healed if his appointed time has come and it is decreed that he should die from this disease. Among the things that may be used in ruqyah are the verses which speak of sihr, which may be recited into water. These are the verses about sihr in Soorat al-A’raaf, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We revealed to Moosa (saying): ‘Throw your stick,’ and behold! It swallowed up straight away all the falsehood which they showed. Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect. So they were defeated there and returned disgraced [al-A’raaf 7:117-119] And in Soorat Yoonus (interpretation of the meaning): “And Pharaoh said: ‘Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.’ And when the sorcerers came, Moosa said to them: ‘Cast down what you want to cast!’ Then when they had cast down, Moosa said: ‘What you have brought is sorcery, Allah will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allah does not set right the work of Al-Mufsidoon. And Allah will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the Mujrimoon may hate (it).’” [Yoonus 10:79-82] And in Soorat Ta-Ha (interpretation of the meaning): “They said: ‘O Moosa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?’ Moosa said: ‘Nay, throw you (first)!’ Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast. So Moosa conceived fear in himself. We (Allah) said: ‘Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician’s trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.’” [Ta-Ha 20:65-69] These aayahs are among the things by which Allah causes the ruqyah against sihr to be beneficial. If the qaari’ (reader) recites these verses into water, and also reads Soorat al-Faatiha, Aayat al-Kursiy, “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad”, and al-Mi’wadhatayn into the water, then pours it over the person who he thinks has been affected by sihr or is being prevented by magic from having intercourse with his wife, then he will be healed by Allah’s Leave. If seven lotus leaves are ground up and added to the water as well, this is appropriate, as was mentioned by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) in Fath al-Majeed, quoting from some of the scholars in the chapter entitled Ma jaa’a fi’l-Nushrah. It is mustahabb to recite the three soorahs, namely Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad, Qul A’oodhu bi Rabb il Falaq and Qul A’oodhu bi Rabb il-Naas. The point is that these and similar treatments which are used to treat this problem of sihr, may also be used to treat the one who is prevented by magic from having intercourse with his wife. This has been tried a great deal and Allah caused it to yield results. A person may be treated with al-Faatihah alone and be healed, or with Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad and al-Mi’wadhatayn on their own, and be healed. It is very important that the person performing this treatment and the person who is being treated should both have sincere faith and trust in Allah; they should know that He is control of all things and that when He wills a thing it happens, and when He does not will a thing it does not happen. The matter is in His hand, whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen. When both the reader and the one who is read over have faith and are sincere towards Allah, the sickness will disappear quickly by Allah’s Leave, and both physical and spiritual medicine will be beneficial. We ask Allah to help us all to please Him, for He is All-Hearing and is ever Near."
123,Feeling that something is not right with seeking knowledge,Question Some seekers of Islamic knowledge feel that it is not right to aim for a certificate. How can the seeker of knowledge rid himself of these feelings?,"Praise be to Allah. He may respond to that in several ways: Firstly, he should not aim for the certificate itself, rather these certificates should be used as a means to work in order to benefit people in any given field, because nowadays work is based on certificates, and people usually cannot find a way to benefit others except by these means. If he develops this intention, then his intention is sound. Secondly, anyone who wants to gain knowledge can only find it in these colleges, so he should enter with the intention of seeking knowledge and not let himself be affected by whatever certificates he may gain after that. Thirdly, if a person wants to earn the good things of both this world and the Hereafter by means of his work, there is nothing wrong with that, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3] This is encouragement to fear Allaah with regard to a worldly matter. If it is asked, with regard to a person who does what he does for worldly purposes, how can we say that he is sincere? Our answer is: If he is being sincere in his worship, and he does not pay attention to people at all, and he is not doing it to show off to people and earn their praise for his worship, rather his aim to earn some materialistic gains as one of the results of his worship – then this is not the same as showing off and trying to draw closer to people by doing things which are only for drawing closer to Allaah, hoping that people will praise him for that. But by hoping for material gain from this action, his intention is undermined and it becomes a kind of shirk, and his status is lower than that of someone whose intention is focused solely on the Hereafter. I would like to take this opportunity to point out when some people speak of worldly gains, such as saying that prayer involves physical exercise and calms the nerves, and that fasting cleanses the body and disciplines eating habits, we should not make worldly gains the main aim of worship, because that will lead to a weakening of sincerity and negligence in seeking the Hereafter. Hence Allaah has explained to us in His Book that the wisdom behind fasting, for example, is to promote taqwa (piety). The religious benefits are the primary aim, and worldly benefits are secondary. When we speak to the common people we should tell them of the spiritual aspects, and when we speak to those who cannot be convinced by anything other than materialistic considerations, then we can tell them of both the spiritual and worldly benefits; it is a matter of addressing each in the manner he understands best."
124,Should we adopt a gradual approach when applying the rulings (of sharee’ah)?,"Question What is the difference between the gradual approach in the forbidding of alcohol, and the command of jihaad, whereby we are required to abide by the final ruling on alcohol (i.e., total prohibition) but are told to do of jihaad only as much as we are able?","Praise be to Allah.After the religion was perfected and the rulings of sharee’ah took their final shape by the time the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, the rulings of Islam are to accepted in their entirety and it is not permissible to take a gradual approach in applying the rulings – unlike the case at the beginning of Islam. In the case of alcohol, for example, every Muslim is obliged to believe that it is haraam to drink it. Whoever believes otherwise – when he is aware of the prohibition – is a murtadd (apostate), because he is denying something which is well known to be forbidden in Islam, from the evidence of sharee’ah, and by scholarly consensus. With regard to the commandments of sharee’ah, the extent to which one is obliged to do them is connected to the extent of one's ability to do them. One is not obliged to do that which one is not able to do or that which will cause one undue difficulty or harm. Everyone will be held accountable according to his own circumstances. Whether or not jihaad is obligatory on an individual or on the ummah as a whole depends on the situation. We cannot say that this is the matter of a gradual approach in legislation (sharee’ah). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can” [al-Taghaabun 64:16] And it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever I have commanded you to do, do as much of it as you can, and whatever I have forbidden you, avoid it.”"
125,Some of the rulings on apostasy and apostates,"Question I am happy to have found this website of yours. I was born a Muslim and I learned a lot of Islamic teachings after I reached adolescence. I am trying to understand my religion. I have read in some of your answers on the issue of apostasy that the punishment for the apostate is to be put to death. But I have read on another website that the apostate who is to be put to death is the one who wages war on Islam (muhaarib). I am more inclined towards the second opinion. The reason for that is that I have friends who were born in Muslim families and who have Muslim names, but some of them do not know how to do wudoo’ or how to pray, but they acknowledge the Shahaadatayn. Can we regard these people as apostates and thus put them to death?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The Muslim should not incline more towards one scholarly opinion rather than another just because it is in accordance with his whims and desires or his reasoning. Rather he has to accept the ruling based on evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah. It is essential to put the texts and rulings of sharee’ah before all else. Secondly: Apostasy (riddah) and going out of Islam are things that may be done in the heart, on the tongue or in one's actions. Apostasy may take place in the heart, such as disbelieving in Allaah, or believing that there is another creator alongside Allaah, or hating Allaah or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Apostasy may take the form of words spoken on the tongue, such as defaming Allaah or the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Or apostasy may take the form of outward physical actions, such as prostrating to an idol, mistreating the Mus-haf, or not praying. The apostate (murtadd) is worse than one who is a kaafir in the first place. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, refuting the pantheistic belief of the Baatinis: It is well known that the kaafir Tatars are better than these (Baatinis), because the latter are apostates from Islam, of the worst type of apostates. The apostate is worse than one who is a kaafir in the first place in many aspects. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 1/193 Secondly: Not every Muslim who falls into kufr is a kaafir and apostate. There are reasons why a Muslim may be excused and not judged to be a kaafir, for example: ignorance, misunderstanding, being forced, and making mistakes. With regard to the first, a man may be ignorant of the ruling of Allaah, because he lives far from the Muslim lands, such as one who grows up in the desert or in a kaafir land, or has only recently come to Islam. This may include many of those Muslims who live in societies where ignorance prevails and knowledge is scarce. These are the ones concerning whom the questioner is confused as to whether they are to be judged as kaafirs and executed. The second reason is if a person interprets the ruling of Allaah in a manner not intended by the Lawgiver, such as those who blindly follow the people of bid’ah (innovation) in their misinterpretations, such as the Murji’ah, Mu’tazilah, Khawaarij and the like. The third reason is if an oppressor overwhelms a Muslim and will not let him go until he makes a blatant statement of kufr out loud in order to ward off the torture, when his heart is at ease with faith. The fourth is when words of kufr come to one's lips without meaning it. Not everyone who is ignorant about wudoo’ and prayer can be excused, when he sees the Muslims establishing prayer and praying regularly, and he can read and hear the verses on prayer. What is preventing him from praying or from asking about how it is done and what its essential conditions are? Fourthly: The apostate is not to be put to death immediately after he falls into apostasy, especially if his apostasy happens because of some doubt that arose. Rather he should be asked to repent and he should be offered the opportunity to return to Islam and resolve his doubts, if he has any doubts. Then if he persists in his apostasy after that, he is to be put to death. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni, 9/18: The apostate should not be put to death until he has been asked to repent three times. This is the view of the majority of scholars, including ‘Umar, ‘Ali, ‘Ata’, al-Nakhaii, Maalik, al-Thawri, al-Awzaa’i, Ishaaq and others. Because apostasy comes about because of doubt, and cannot be dispelled in an instant. Time should be allowed for the person to rethink the matter, and the best length of time is three days. End quote. The saheeh Sunnah indicates that it is essential to put the apostate to death. Al-Bukhaari (6922) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, put him to death.” Al-Bukhaari (6484) and Muslim (1676) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that there is no god except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah, except in one of three cases: a soul for a soul (i.e., in the case of murder); a previously-married person who commits zina; and one who leaves his religion and separates from the main body of the Muslims.” The general meaning of these ahaadeeth indicates that it is essential to put the apostate to death whether he is waging war on Islam (muhaarib) or not. The view that the apostate who is to be put to death is the one who is waging war on Islam (muhaarib) only is contrary to these ahaadeeth. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the reason why he should be put to death is his apostasy, not his waging war against Islam. Undoubtedly some kinds of apostasy are more abhorrent than others, and the apostasy of one who wages war against Islam is more abhorrent than that of anyone else. Hence some of the scholars differentiated between them, and said that it is not essential to ask the muhaarib to repent or to accept his repentance; rather he should be put to death even if he repents, whereas the repentance of one who is not a muhaarib should be accepted and he should not be put to death. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). He said: Apostasy is of two types: ordinary apostasy and extreme apostasy, for which execution is prescribed. In both cases there is evidence that it is essential to execute the apostate, but the evidence indicating that the sentence of death may be waived if the person repents does not apply to both types of apostasy. Rather the evidence indicates that that is allowed only in the first case – i.e., ordinary apostasy – as will be clear to anyone who studies the evidence that speaks about accepting the repentance of the apostate. In the second type – i.e., extreme apostasy – the obligation to put the apostate to death still stands, and there is no text or scholarly consensus to indicate that the death sentence may be waived. The two cases are quite different and there is no comparison between them. It does not say in the Qur’aan or Sunnah, or according to scholarly consensus, that everyone who apostatizes in word or deed may be spared the death sentence if he repents after he is a captured and tried. Rather the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus, differentiate between the different kinds of apostates. Al-Saarim al-Maslool, 3/696 Al-Hallaaj was one of the most well known heretics who were put to death without being asked to repent. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The Maaliki fuqaha’ of Baghdad at the time of al-Muqtadir were unanimously agreed that al-Hallaaj should be killed and crucified because of his claim to divinity and his belief in incarnation, and his saying “I am al-Haqq [God],” even though he outwardly appeared to adhere to sharee’ah, and they did not accept his repentance. Al-Shifa bi Ta’reef Huqooq al-Mustafa, 2/1091. Based on this, it is clear that what the questioner says about the apostate not being killed unless he is waging war on Islam is mistaken, and the differentiation that we have quoted from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah may dispel any confusion and make the matter clearer. Waging war against Islam is not limited only to fighting with weapons, rather it may be done verbally such as defaming Islam or the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or attacking the Qur’aan, and so on. Waging verbal war against Islam may be worse than waging war against it with weapons in some cases. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Muhaarabah (waging war against Islam) is of two types: physical and verbal. Waging war verbally against Islam may be worse than waging war physically – as stated above – hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to kill those who waged war against Islam verbally, whilst letting off some of those who waged war against Islam physically. This ruling is to be applied more strictly after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Mischief may be caused by physical action or by words, but the damage caused by words is many times greater than that caused by physical action; and the goodness achieved by words in reforming may be many times greater than that achieved by physical action. It is proven that waging war against Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) verbally is worse and the efforts on earth to undermine religion by verbal means is more effective. Al-Saarim al-Maslool, 3/735 Fifthly: With regard to not praying, the correct view is that the one who does not pray is a kaafir and an apostate. See question no. 5208. And Allaah knows best."
126,Ruling on extravagance in wedding party and honeymoon,"Question I have a fiancee who is giving me problems with money. She wants so many expensive things just for the wedding and the honeymoon. I keep saying that we shouldnt spend too much money on these things because it will lose baraka, but she just says its a once in a lifetime thing. Is she right? Is spending alot of money just for a wedding and a one week honeymoon justified just because it's only once in our life? Please let me know, and I already know about spending on the wife is good, but I'm not referring to food and clothing and housing, only the extravagant things.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The general principle according to which a man should conduct his spending is the same general principle according to which he should conduct his life, which is the middle way and moderation. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)” [al-Furqaan 25:67]. The middle way and moderation cannot be indentified by specific amounts or specific limits, that if a person oversteps steps that mark he can be described as being extravagant and if he falls short of it then he is being a miser or niggardly; rather that varies according to the individual’s situation, whether he is rich or poor, whether it is a case of ordinary expenses or an emergency. It also varies from one place to another, one time to another, and so on. The ruling on whether something is extravagance or not takes into account all of these things. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allâh has given him. Allâh puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him” [al-Talaaq 65:7]. See also the answers to questions no. 101903 and 137954 Secondly: Wedding parties are among the things in which it is prescribed to express happiness and joy and to instil that in the family and the wife, but that does not mean that one should fall into extravagance or spend unnecessarily. The argument that it is only once in a lifetime cannot be an excuse tospend too much. Being extravagant only once is not allowed and is haraam, just as being extravagant more than once is repeatedly falling into something that is not allowed and is haraam. The scholars are still urging people not to be extravagant in wedding parties and other expenses that have to do with weddings in general. They suggest that this is one of the factors that make the issue of marriage complicated for those who want to get married, to such an extent that the numbers of young women who remain unmarried have increased. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is your opinion on expensive dowries and extravagance in wedding parties, especially preparations for what is called the honeymoon, which includes high expenses? Does Islam approve of this? He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: Expensive dowries and extravagance in wedding parties are things that are contrary to sharee‘ah. The most blessed marriage is that which is affordable; the less the expenses are, the greater the blessings. This is something that in most cases is the fault of women, because women are the ones who force their husbands to pay for expensive parties that are not allowed in sharee‘ah. This is something that is included in the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “…but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allâh) likes not Al-Musrifûn (those who waste by extravagance)” [al-A‘raaf 7:31]. Many women force their husbands to do that and say “So and so had such and such in her party” and so on. But what is required in such matters is to act in the way prescribed in Islam and not overstep that mark or be extravagant, because Allah – may He be glorified and exalted – has forbidden extravagance and has said that He does not like those who waste by extravagance. With regard to what is called the “honeymoon”, it is even worse and more reprehensible, because it is an imitation of the non-Muslims and it is a great waste of money. It also leads to neglect of many religious matters, especially if this time is spent in a non-Muslim country, after which they come back with habits and customs that are harmful to them and to their society. These are matters which are dangerous to the ummah. But if the man were to travel with his wife to do ‘Umrah or to visit Madinah, there is nothing wrong with that, in sha Allah. End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/176 The Council of Senior Scholars in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has researched these issues that have to do with people going to extremes with regard to dowries and competing in extravagance in wedding parties, overstepping the mark with regard to wedding feasts and what accompanies that of lighting systems that go beyond the limit of moderation, and entertainment, singing and musical instruments that are haraam being played at loud volume which may go on all night and in some cases be louder than the voices of the muezzins giving the call to Fajr prayer, and what precedes that of engagement parties and feasts to celebrate the drawing up of the wedding contract. They also discussed what has been narrated about reducing the dowry, being moderate in spending and avoiding extravagance and waste. The Council commented on that by saying: Because of this going to extremes in dowries and competing in offering lavish wedding feasts leads to overstepping the mark, and because there are so many celebrations that are done before and after the wedding, and because of what accompanies that of haraam things that lead to immorality, such as singing and mixing between men and women on some occasions, and men serving women in hotels if the party is held in a hotel, which is regarded as one of the greatest of evils, and because going that path of extravagance means that many people are unable to afford the expenses of marriage and indeed this indecent extravagance may lead to many young people, both boys and girls, going astray… for all these reasons the Council of Senior Scholars thinks that it is essential to take this matter seriously and deal with it by doing the following: ·The Council thinks that there should be a ban on singing that has recently become popular in wedding parties, along with what accompanies it of musical instruments, hiring of male and female singers and of loudspeakers, because this is an evil and haraam action that should be disallowed and those who do that should be stopped. ·There should be a ban on mixing of men and women in wedding parties and elsewhere; the husband should not be allowed to enter upon his wife when she is among unveiled women. Those who allow that, such as the husband and the guardians of the woman, should be punished in a way that will serve as a deterrent to committing such evils. ·There should be a ban on extravagance and overstepping the mark with regard to wedding feasts. People should be warned against that through the officials who record marriages and through the media. People should be encouraged to lower the dowry and extravagance in such matters should be discouraged from the minbars of the mosque, in learning circles and through the media. ·The majority of the Council thinks that those who are clearly extravagant in spending on wedding feasts should be punished and that they should be referred to the courts to impose disciplinary punishment on those who are proven to have overstepped the mark, according to what the shar‘i judge sees fit as a deterrent punishment that will discourage people from getting involved in such alarming behaviour. ·The Council thinks that encouragement to reduce dowries should be given from the minbars of the mosques and through the media, and that some cases should be mentioned as an example of making marriage easy. If cases are mentioned of someone who has returned part of what was given as a dowry, or as being content with a moderate wedding party, this should be mentioned as an example because that is very effective. End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/251. To sum up: Extravagance is not allowed and is blameworthy in all matters, whether it has to do with marriage or otherwise. What is prescribed in Islam is that the individual should not make things difficult for himself and should not burden himself with more than he can bear. Rather he should spend according to his means and what he is able to afford, whilst avoiding extravagance and going to extremes in spending. But this does not mean that spending on wedding parties and marriage should be like spending on ordinary days, for example. Of course this is not appropriate; rather it is prescribed to spend more generously than usual at this time. For that reason it is Sunnah for a man to offer a feast at his wedding and to invite people to it. This is an expense that is greater than usual, but what matters, as we have said, is to avoid extravagance and wasteful spending in all of that. Each individual should pay attention to his own situation and what he can afford. See also the answer to question no. 11446. And Allah knows best."
127,No Angels or Other Creatures Know Everything in the Heavens and Earth,"Question My daughter asked me: Who is the angel who knows everything in the heavens and the earth, the number of drops of water, the number of grains of sand? Is there any such thing?","Praise be to Allah. The one who knows everything in the heavens and on earth, and knows the number of drops of water and the number of grains of sand is Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. There is no angel who is close to Him or any Prophet who was sent who has this knowledge. Anyone who says that there is anyone among the angels who knows all of this has fabricated a lie against Allah, to Whom belongs knowledge of the unseen of the heavens and the earth. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in (or on) the earth and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record” [6:59]. And He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected” [27:65]. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Here Allah, may He be exalted, is instructing His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to tell all of mankind that no one knows the unseen except Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and that He alone has that knowledge, with no partner or associate. End quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer, (6/207). Al-Bukhaari (4697) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The keys of the Unknown are five, which no one knows except Allah: no one knows what will happen tomorrow except Allah; no one knows what is in the wombs except Allah; no one knows when it will rain except Allah; no one knows in which land he will die; and no one knows when the Hour will begin except Allah.” But Allah, may He be exalted, may inform whomever He wills among His creation about whatever He wills of His unseen. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(He Alone) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghaib (unseen). Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the unseen as much as He likes), and then He makes a band of watching guards (angels) to march before him and behind him.” [72:26, 27]. The scholars of the Standing Committee said: Knowledge of unseen matters is something that belongs exclusively to Allah, so no one among His creation, human or jinn, knows anything of it except what Allah reveals to whomever He wills among His Angels or His Messengers. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, (1/346). Yes, there is an angel who is appointed in charge of the rain, and directs it wherever Allah wills; he is Mikaa’eel (peace be upon him), who has helpers who do whatever he instructs them to do. But this only happens by the will of Allah and in accordance with His wisdom and knowledge. They do not know anything or do anything; rather they cannot do anything at all except by Allah’s leave. Moreover, that does not mean that they know the number of drops of water, because their knowledge is restricted to what Allah has taught them, and they say, as Allah tells us: “Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise” [2:32]. For more information, please see the answer to questions no. 843 and 101968 And Allah knows best."
128,Our attitude towards rumours and news on the Internet,"Question How should we deal with the rumours that appear on the Internet? What is the Muslim’s attitude towards the news that we read here and there, and what is written in chat rooms, especially since some of it is good news for the Muslims, but the source is unknown.","Praise be to Allah.We live nowadays at a time when many rumours that bring hope are appearing in the guise of news. These appears on Internet web sites and chat rooms, so that they may be spread to the people as glad tidings and so that good-hearted people may accept them as indisputable facts coming from trustworthy sources. Even if any of them could be proven, there are still many rumours that can be classed as no more than fabrications. The one who thinks about this will understand that many of the global media, including the Arab media, exaggerate in their coverage of some events and they analyze them in a subjective manner that shows a complete bias and evident absence of objectivity, trying to take revenge by adding to the news and exaggerating, and telling weird news stories. So there is no such thing as credibility in these media, especially when emotions and wishes play a part. This is apart from the fact that media objectivity has become a victim of this current war, and western circles have rejected the lessons [of objectivity, etc.] that they used to teach others. But this does not mean that we should dispute the facts or deny what is taking place in reality, or that we should face this bias with exaggeration and hopes. Here we should pause and remind ourselves, and the good-hearted people who hear this news and tell it to others with good intentions – and those who fabricate these rumours and take upon themselves the job of propagating them – of a few facts. 1 – We must be certain about the news we accept, and we should not accept it simply because it happens to coincide with our hopes and wishes. We have our own methodology of verifying matters, and we should be consistent with regard to what we like and dislike. It is not right for us to doubt news accompanied by pictures from the battlefield, or to shed doubts on it, when the bottom line is one’s senses. At a time when you see news going around through mobiles from some internet web sites, there are some people who may accept such news but it should be noted that there are people who will never believe it. So they should beware of exposing themselves to being called liars. An old proverb says, “Whoever pursues weird news will be disbelieved.” 2 – We have to be cautious about the fact that the source is anonymous. There is no information more important than that of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), yet despite that it is not part of the Muslims’ methodology to accept reports of the Sunnah from people who are unknown. Hence news must be taken from authentic sources; if it is not authentic then it should at least be known, so that people may be able to find out for themselves whether it is authentic or not. What a bad habit it is for a man to say, “I heard” or “they said.” 3 – If there are people who permit the fabrication of rumours, basing that on some kind of ijtihaad, we must refuse to be the means of transmitting that by believing it and propagating it. (Whoever narrates a saying knowing it to be a lie is one of the liars). 4 – One of the reasons used by the fabricators to justify making up these rumours is that it is a kind of lying in war, which is permissible. They ignore the fact – of which they are not ignorant – that the only kind of lying that is permitted in war is that which misleads the enemy, not that which creates illusions and deceives the Muslims. 5 – If we have lost some aspects of the battle, we must not lose truthfulness which is our capital in our dealings with others. People will be astounded and amazed if they find out that this false news was transmitted through a good man. Whoever is known to have lied or to have transmitted lies will no longer be in a position to be considered trustworthy. 6 – Similarly the righteous will be astounded and will become suspicious of a narrator who appeared to be righteous because he was telling this news and confirming it to them. At the same time, others will express joy, those who took the opposite stance to these youngsters and said, “This is their news, this is their credibility!” Everyone who was upset by the Muslim revival will find an opportunity to generalize this mistake and accuse all the pioneers of the revival of behaving like that. Please, for Allaah’s sake, do not make the enemy rejoice or give them a reason to attack. 7 – If truthfulness is an Islamic virtue and part of Arabic chivalry, then telling lies is an obscenity that Islam has forbidden. Even the mushrik Arabs refrained from telling lies, as Abu Sufyaan – when he was still a mushrik – said: “Were it not that I am afraid that people may find out that I had told a lie, I would have told lies about him.” That was when he was speaking to Heraclius (about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). He did not want to have even one lie to be found in his history, even if it was a lie told against his enemy Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Heraclius (the Roman ruler). We are concerned that the propagation of these rumours may lead people to record a lot of lies against us. 8 – Fabricating rumours and believing them readily is a form of escapism in the face of a reality which one dislikes and with which one does not feel comfortable. The soul finds consolation in denying that which it does not like and in fabricating and disseminating rumours, but in the end it will have to submit to the authority of overwhelming reality. But this psychological trick is not fit to be the means of escapism for the followers of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who taught them the virtues of truthfulness and commanded them to strive their utmost to be truthful. He said: “Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man will continue to speak the truth and strive to be truthful, until he will be recorded with Allaah as a speaker of the truth. And lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hell, a man will continue to tell lies and strive in telling lies, until he will be recorded with Allaah as a liar.” 9 – Delaying recognition of realities and veiling reality with illusions, the greatest form of which is believing and disseminating rumours, will only multiply the amount of losses, and the greatest loss will be the loss of values. The highest and most precious of those values is truthfulness. “then if they had been true to Allaah, it would have been better for them” [Muhammad 47:21 – interpretation of the meaning] 10 – Recognizing the truth is the first step towards dealing with crises and overcoming them, but not admitting them and concealing them are among the greatest means of reinforcing them, renewing them and repeating them. 11 – Our advice is not to transmit this news. We must advise those who transmit it with the best of intentions and present them with the real facts, we should not try to spare their feelings at the expense of our reason and the transmission of truthful news, and we should try to rescue them from the anxiety of illusion and point them in the direction of reality, because truthfulness brings peace of mind and lies bring suspicion. 12 – Sayyid Qutub (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The reality of a thing defeats the outward appearance of another thing, even if it is the reality of kufr.” How I wish that I did not have to talk in this manner, but the problem is there and must be addressed. I have tried to be truthful when speaking about truthfulness, for the dearest of speech to Allaah is that which is most sincere. “O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)” [al-Tawbah 9:119 – interpretation of the meaning] O Allaah, show us the truth as truth and enable us to follow it; show us the false as false and enable us to avoid it. Guide us concerning disputed matters of truth by Your leave, for You guide Whomsoever You wish to the Straight Path. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammd and upon his family and companions."
129,A large amount of money came into his account and he spent it all,"Question I found a large amount of money in my account twelve years ago, and I was in need of it, so I spent it. I do not know who deposited it in my account. We checked with the bank and they could not find the name of the person who deposited it. All they were able to find out was the place where the deposit was made. Now I want to discharge my responsibility concerning it. Should I give the money to some charitable cause, with the intention of the reward going to the person who deposited the money in my account?","Praise be to Allah.The depositing of the money in your account may have been a mistake, or it may have been done deliberately. But the idea of it having been done deliberately is very unlikely, because in that case it would be money that the owner did not want, and he gave it to you, so you could keep it. If it was done by mistake – which is what appears to be the case – then it must be returned to its owner. If you are not able to find out who its owner is, then you should give it in charity on his behalf, on the basis that, if one day you find out who its owner was, you will give him the choice between approving of that charity or taking back his money. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person has money or property, and does not know who the owner is – as in the case of one who seized it by force and has repented, or one who acquired it by treachery and has repented, and the like, who has property in his possession of which he is not the owner, but he does not know who the owner is – then he should give it to people who are in need or spend it in the interests of the Muslims. Al-Fataawa al-Kubra (4/220) He (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked about some pilgrims who encountered some Bedouin bandits who had been raiding travellers and had taken their fabric. They fled, leaving behind their camels and the fabric. Is it permissible to take the camels that belonged to the thieves and the fabric that they stole, or not? He replied: What they took of the pilgrims’ property must be returned to them, if possible. This is like lost property which should be announced for a year. If its owner comes along and claims it, all well and good, otherwise the finder may spend it (or use it) on condition that he assume liability. But if the finder despairs of ever finding its owner, then he may give it in charity and spend it in the interests of the Muslims. The same applies to any property of which the owner is not known, such as property seized by force, borrowed items, items that were left in trust, and items seized from thieves, which belong to people, or items that have been thrown away. All such property may be given in charity or spent in the interests of the Muslims. Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (30/413) And Allah knows best."
130,He wants to publish some video clips and put the name of his website on them; is it permissible for him to do that?,"Question I am the owner of an Islamic website, but the visitors and members are still few and the website is not active. I work in the service of Islam and only propagate my site on social media sites. For example, I can find a video or a khutbah by one of the shaykhs and write the name of my website on the video, and put it – for example – on YouTube or other websites, although I did not record the video. Is this haraam? Please note that the one who recorded the video or made the picture did not put the name of his website or his own name on it. I can also put a link to my website in my signature when I post to some sites in order to attract visitors. Is this is regarded as stealing?","Praise be to Allah. What we know about audio and video clips of shaykhs on YouTube and other sites is that they are not usually subject to copyright, and that they are free for whoever wants to download them and put them on various websites. In fact most of them are originally taken from free satellite channels or Friday khutbahs or lessons that are free and open to all. In this regard there is nothing wrong with publishing those clips on other websites in order to spread the benefits thereof, if that is the case. But if they are subject to copyright, then it is not permissible to publish them except with the permission of the authors. Most websites allow publishing their material subject to two conditions: 1. that it is not used for commercial purposes 2. that it is not changed or altered. As you do not want to use the material you take for commercial purposes and you have not changed the contents of this material, there is nothing wrong with republishing it and spreading the benefits thereof, in sha Allah. As that is the case, there is also nothing wrong with putting the name of your website on this material so that people will know about it and so as to promote the beneficial material on the website. If you can put on your website a section for the mukhtaaraat that you have taken from others, and have not produced yourself, that is better and is further removed from claiming as your own that which you did not produce itself. In this way you will be able to rid yourself of any discomfort you are feeling whilst also promoting your website.

131,I do not want to get married but my parents want me to; am I Islamically obliged to agree?,Question Im 19 and my parents are asking me to get married cuz of some reasons but im not interested so what do i do..listen to them or say what i feel and stand with it? cuz ive already said them that im not ready.,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that marriage is part of the teachings and practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rebuked those who wanted to remain unmarried. He said: “As for me, I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah (my way) is not of me.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4776) and Muslim (1401). What is meant by “my Sunnah” is his guidance and path. No one has the right to forsake the path, guidance and Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for the sake of some worldly matter because he is keen to pursue further studies or earn more money or seek some social position, or because of some specious argument of the evil doers that comes to his mind, and so on. This teaching is more emphasized at times of fitnah (turmoil or temptation) when a person fears for himself (that he may give into temptation) because there is no control and no one is watching him. So the Muslim is enjoined to seek help in controlling his evil inclinations and in resisting the Shaytaan by all possible means, and he is enjoined to seek and attain chastity. If he fears that he may give in to temptation, then it is obligatory for him to get married, so as to ward off temptation and corruption from his religious commitment. You should understand that some younger women may be sought in marriage at a specific age, when compatible and righteous men propose marriage to them, but they refuse on the grounds that they want to complete their studies, or they are looking for someone who is more rich, and so on. Then they grow older and spend the rest of their lives waiting. By doing so, they go against the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to accept a righteous husband who is religiously committed and of good character. “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then give [your daughter or other female relative under your care] to him in marriage, for if you do not do that there will be fitnah in the land and a great deal of mischief.” [Hadeeth narrated by at-Tirmidhi] By doing that, the woman forgets her true role in life, the purpose for which Allah created mankind in two halves, male and female, and made that one of the signs of His might and power, and of His Oneness, may He be exalted. Therefore we do not agree that you should disregard the idea of marriage altogether on the grounds of pursuing further study or seeking material gains. If you do have a clear reason for that, then explain it to your parents and come to some mutual understanding about it, so long as you are not using that as an excuse to forgo marriage altogether and ignore one of the greatest means of maintaining a sound way of life and establishing true servitude (‘uboodiyyah) to Allah in this world. But if what you meant is that you do not want to marry a particular individual, for some reason, although you accept the principle if a compatible man proposes to you, then this is your right and there is nothing wrong with that; your parents do not have the right to force you to marry a particular person. Please see also the answer to question no. 163990 And Allah knows best."
132,Love,"Question If a girl loves a boy from afar, has she committed a sin?.","Praise be to Allah.Islam came to close the doors that lead to evil and sin, and is keen to block all the means that may lead to corruption of hearts and minds. Love and infatuation between the sexes are among the worst of problems. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (10/129): Love is a psychological sickness, and if it grows strong it affects the body, and becomes a physical sickness, either as diseases of the brain, which are said to be diseases caused by waswaas, or diseases of the body such as weakness, emaciation and so on. End quote. And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (10/132): Loving a non-mahram woman leads to many negative consequences, the full extent of which is known only to the Lord of people. It is a sickness that affects the religious commitment of the sufferer, then it may also affect his mind and body. End quote. It is sufficient to note that one of the effects of love of a member of the opposite sex is enslavement of the heart which is held captive to the loved one. So love is a door that leads to humiliation and servility. That is sufficient to put one off this sickness. Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (10/185): If a man is in love with a woman, even if she is permissible for him, his heart remains enslaved to her, and she can control him as she wishes, even though outwardly he appears to be her master, because he is her husband; but in fact he is her prisoner and slave, especially if she is aware of his need and love for her. In that case, she will control him like a harsh and oppressive master controls his abject slave who cannot free himself from him. Rather he is worse off than that, because enslavement of the heart is worse than enslavement of the body. End quote. Attachment to the opposite sex will not happen to a heart that is filled with love of Allah; it only affects a heart that is empty and weak, so it is able to gain control of it, then when it becomes strong and powerful it is able to defeat the love of Allah and lead the person into shirk. Hence it is said: Love is the action of an empty heart. If the heart is devoid of the love and remembrance of the Most Merciful, and is a stranger to speaking to Him, it will be filled with love of women, images and listening to music. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (10/135): If the heart loves Allah alone and is sincerely devoted to Him, it will not even think of loving anyone else in the first place, let alone falling in love. When a heart falls in love, that is due to the lack of love for Allah alone. Hence because Yoosuf loved Allah and was sincerely devoted to Him, he did not fall into the trap of love, rather Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse. Surely, he was one of Our chosen, (guided) slaves” [Yoosuf 12:24] As for the wife of al-‘Azeez, she was a mushrik as were her people, hence she fell into this trap. End quote. The Muslim must save himself from this fate and not fall short in guarding against it and ridding himself of it. If he falls short in that regard and follows the path of love, by continuing to steal haraam glances or listening to haraam things, and being careless in the way he speaks to the opposite sex, etc, then he is affected by love as a result, then he is sinning and will be subject to punishment for his actions. How many people have been careless at the beginning of this problem, and thought that they were able to rid themselves of it whenever they wanted, or that they could stop at a certain limit and not go any further, until the sickness took a strong hold and no doctor or remedy could help? Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Rawdat al-Muhibbeen (147): If the cause happens by his choice, he has no excuse for the consequences that are beyond his control, but if the reason is haraam, the drunkard had no excuse. Undoubtedly following one glance with another and allowing oneself to keep thinking about the person is like drinking intoxicants: he is to be blamed for the cause. End quote. If a person strives to keep away from the things that lead to this serious sickness, by lowering his gaze and not looking at haraam things, not listening to haraam things, and averting the passing thoughts that the shaytaan casts into his mind, then after that something of the evils of this sickness befalls him because of a passing glance or a transaction that is basically permissible, and his heart becomes attached to a woman, there is no sin on him for that in sha Allah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [Al-Baqarah 2:286] Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (11/10): If that does not result from carelessness or transgression on his part, then there is no sin on him for what befalls him. End quote. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Rawdat al-Muhibbeen (147): If love occurs for a reason that is not haraam, the person is not to be blamed, such as one who loved his wife or slave woman, then he separated from her but the love remained and did not leave him. He is not to be blamed for that. Similarly if there was a sudden glance then he averted his gaze, but love took hold of his heart without him meaning it to, he must, however, ward it off and resist it. End quote. But he must treat his heart by putting a stop to the effects of this love, and by filling his heart with love of Allah and seeking His help in that. He should not feel too shy to consult intelligent and trustworthy people for advice or consult some doctors and psychologists, because he may find some remedy with them. In doing that he must be patient, seek reward, remain chaste and keep quiet, and Allah will decree reward for him in sha Allah. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (10/133): If he is tested with love but he remains chaste and is patient, then he will be rewarded for fearing Allah. It is known from shar’i evidence that if a person remains chaste and avoids haraam things in looking, word and deeds, and he keeps quiet about it and does not speak of it, so that there will be haraam talk about that, whether by complaining to another person or committing evil openly, or pursuing the beloved one in any way, and he is patient in obeying Allah and avoiding sin, despite the pain of love that he feels in his heart, just as one who is afflicted with a calamity bears the pain of it with patience, then he will be one of those who fear Allah and are patient, “Verily, he who fears Allah with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the Muhsinoon (good‑doers) to be lost” [Yoosuf 12:90].

133,He wants to see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream,Question What is the best way to see Prophet Muhammad in a dream??.,"Praise be to Allah.There is no way prescribed in sharee’ah for the one who wants to see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream. It is appropriate here to comment on a number of matters that have to do with this question: 1 – The one who sees the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream has to see him in his true form, at any stage of his life. So if a person claims to have seen light or a man with a completely white beard or a man wearing pants for example, these are not attributes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so this is not the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Shaytaan cannot appear in the true image of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but he can appear in other forms. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, “Whoever sees me in a dream will see me when he is awake, and the Shaytaan cannot take my shape.” Al-Bukhaari said: Ibn Sireen said: If he sees him in his true image. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6592; Muslim, 2266 If a man told Ibn Sireen that he had seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) [in a dream], he would say, “Describe to me the one whom you saw.” If he gave a description that he did not recognize, he would say, “You did not see him.” Its isnaad is saheeh. Al-Haakim narrated via ‘Aasim ibn Kulayb (who said), my father told me: I said to Ibn ‘Abbaas, “I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream.” He said, “Describe him to me.” He said, “I mentioned al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali and said that he looked like him.” He said, “You did indeed see him.” Its isnaad is jayyid. See Fath al-Baari, 12/383, 384. 2 – The Muslim should not concern himself with dreams and visions, basing his affairs on them and forgetting about the state of wakefulness in which Allaah has enjoined rulings and acts of worship on him. 3 – The Muslim who is following the Sunnah sees the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his heart; the more he follows him the more he will see him. So when he goes out of his house or goes to the mosque or does wudoo’, he remembers what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. When he prays or performs Hajj he follows his Sunnah. When he buys and sells or interacts with people, he acts according to the teachings of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When he is at home with his family and children he follows the teachings of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is what the Muslim should seek and strive to achieve. And Allaah is the Source of strength."
134,Types of Vows in Islam,Question What are the different types of vows in Islam?,"Praise be to Allah.What is a vow? Al-Isfahani (may Allah have mercy on him) says, in his book Mufradat Alfaz al-Quran (Vocabulary of the Quran), p. 797: “Al-Nadhr (vow): when you oblige yourself to do something that is not obligatory because of something that you want to happen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘[Maryam said:] I have vowed a fast unto the Most Beneficent (Allah)…’ [Maryam 19:26].” So a vow is the action, on the part of a person who is adult and of sound mind (mukallaf), of obliging himself to do something that is not obligatory , whether he intends to do it straight away or makes his doing it conditional upon something else. Vows are mentioned in the Quran in approving terms. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the abrar (pious, who fear Allah and avoid evil), shall drink a cup (of wine) mixed with water from a spring in Paradise called Kafur, a spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly. They (are those who) fulfill their vows, and they fear a Day whose evil will be wide spreading.” [al-Dahr 76:5-7]. So Allah makes their fear of the horrors of the Day of Resurrection and their fulfillment of their vows some of the reasons for their salvation and admittance to Paradise. Do you have to fulfill your vows? Fulfilling legitimate (Shar`i) vows is obligatory according to Shari`ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then let them complete the prescribed duties (manasik of Hajj) for them, and perform their vows…” [al-Hajj 22:29]. Imam al-Shawkani said: “This means that they have to do this.” Numerous hadiths have been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) discouraging vows and describing them as makruh. Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not make vows, for vows do not change qadar (the divine decree) in the slightest, but they make the stingy person give something up.’” (Reported by Muslim) ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to discourage us from making vows, and said, ‘They do not change anything, although they may make the miser give up something.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim) One might ask, how is it that those who fulfill their vows are praised, then making vows is discouraged? The answer is that the kind of vow that is praised is the vow to do acts of worship that are not connected to anything – i.e., not conditional upon anything – which makes a man force himself to do acts of worship and prevent himself from being lazy, or in thanksgiving for some blessing. What are the discouraged types of vows? The kinds of vow which are discouraged are of different types, including vows that are made in return for something, whereby a person makes his doing an act of worship conditional upon attaining something or warding off something, and if that does not happen, he does not do the act of worship. Why are these types of vows discouraged? This is what is discouraged, perhaps for the following reasons: Because then the person who made the vow would be doing the act of worship reluctantly, because it has become something he cannot avoid or get out of. Because when the person making the vow makes the act of worship conditional upon his getting what he wants, his vow becomes a kind of exchange or barter which corrupts his intention; if the sick person is not cured, he will not give the charity which he vowed to give if the sick person was healed. This is miserliness, because the miser will not give anything except for something in return in this life (as opposed to the Hereafter), and what he gains is more than what he gives. Some people ignorantly believe that making a vow guarantees that they will get whatever they made the vow for, or that Allah will make it happen for them because of the vow. Another ignorant belief is the idea that making a vow can change qada (the divine decree), or that it can bring them some immediate benefit or ward off some harm. So vows were discouraged lest ignorant people believe such things, and as a warning of the danger that such attitudes present to sound belief. Types of vows and their fulfillment Vows which must be fulfilled (vows to do acts of worship and obedience to Allah) This includes every vow which involves a promise to do some kind of act of worship, such as praying, fasting, performing ‘Umrah or Hajj, upholding family ties, doing I’tikaf (retreat for worship in the mosque), jihad, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. For example, a person may say, “It is my duty towards Allah to fast such-and-such (days)” or to give such-and-such in charity, or to go for Hajj this year, or to pray two rak`ahs in al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] in thanksgiving to Allah for curing a sick person. Or he may make a vow of doing some act of worship conditional upon something that will benefit him if it happens, so he says, “If my absent loved one returns or Allah protects me from the evil of my enemy, I will fast such-and-such (days) or give such-and-such in charity.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6202) If a man vows to do some act of worship then circumstances change and prevent him from fulfilling his vow, such as he vows to fast for a month or to go for Hajj or ‘Umrah, then he falls sick and is unable to fast or travel, or he vows to give charity, then he becomes poor and is unable to give what he promised, then in such cases he must offer expiation (kaffarah) for breaking his vow, which is the same as kaffarat yamin (expiation for breaking an oath). Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “Whoever makes a vow and is then unable to fulfill it, his expiation is kaffarat yamin.” (Reported by Abu Dawud. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Bulugh al-Maram, Its isnad is sahih, and some huffaz thought it was mawquf.). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fatawa (33/49): “If a man intends to vow to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then he must fulfill it. If he does not fulfill his vow to Allah, then he must offer kaffarat yamin, according to the majority of the salaf (early generations of Islam).” Vows which it is forbidden to fulfill, and for which kaffarat yami n must be offered This includes different types of vows: Vows to commit sin : This is every vow which involves disobedience to Allah, such as vows to bring oil, candles or money to graves or shrines (mash-hads), or to visit tombs and shrines of shirk. This is in some ways like making vows to idols. It is also forbidden to fulfill vows which promise to do some sin, like committing zina (adultery, fornication), drinking alcohol, stealing, taking orphans’ property, denying someone’s rights, or cutting family ties by cutting a certain relative off or not entering his house for no shar’i reason. All of these are not permitted at all, and (the person who makes such a vow) must offer kaffarat yamin in expiation for his vow. The evidence (dalil) that it is not permissible to fulfill this kind of vow is the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari). ‘Imran ibn Husayn reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no fulfillment of a vow to commit sin.” (Reported by Muslim, 3099). Vows that go against a shar’i text (of the Quran or Sunnah) If a Muslim makes a vow then it becomes clear to him that this vow of his goes against a clear, sahih text that contains some command or prohibition, then he must refrain from fulfilling his vow, and offer kaffarat yamin for it. The evidence for this is the report of al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) from Ziyad ibn Jubayr, who said: “I was with Ibn ‘Umar and a man asked him, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday as long as I live, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr (the Day of Sacrifice, i.e., the first day of ‘Eid al-Adha).’ He said, ‘Allah has commanded us to fulfill vows and we are forbidden to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ He repeated this to him, and said no more and no less.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, 6212). Imam Ahmad reported that Ziyad ibn Jubayr said: “A man asked Ibn ‘Umar, whilst he was walking in Mina, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr, so what do you think?’ He said, ‘Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfill our vows, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ The man thought that he had not heard him properly, so he said, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr.’ [Ibn ‘Umar] said, ‘Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfill our vows, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ They kept repeating this exchange until they reached the mountain.” Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The scholars agree that it is not permitted to fast on Yawm al-Fitr and Yawm al-Nahr, neither as an act of worship nor in fulfillment of a vow.” Vows concerning which there is no ruling other than kaffarat yamin There are some vows concerning which there is no ruling other than that the one who makes such a vow must offer kaffarat yamin in expiation for his vow. These include: Non-specific vows If a Muslim makes a vow but does not specify what the vow is about, such as saying, “I make a vow if Allah heals this sick person” – but does not specify anything, then he must offer kaffarat yamin. ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The expiation for a vow is kaffarat yamin.” (Reported by Muslim). Imam al-Nawawi said: “Malik and many others – indeed the majority – interpreted this as meaning absolute vows, such as saying ‘I vow’ [without being specific].” (Sharh Muslim li’l-Nawawi, 11/104). Vows concerning things that one does not possess. If a person makes a vow concerning something that is not his, then he has no option but to offer kaffarat yamin. For example, if he vows to give charity from someone else’s wealth, or to free someone else’s slave, or to give a garden that he does not own to someone. The evidence for this ruling is the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The son of Adam cannot make any vow concerning that which is not his, he cannot free (any slave) who is not his, and he cannot divorce any wife who is not his.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1101. He said: The hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr is a sahih hasan hadith). Vows where one has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kaffarat yamin There are vows where a person has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kaffarat yamin. This kind of vow includes: Vows made in desperation or in anger: This means every vow that comes in the form of an oath made to urge for something to be done or to stop something from being done, or to swear that something is true or not true, where the person does not really intend to make a vow to do some act of worship. For example, a man might say in anger, ‘If I ever do such-and-such I have to go for Hajj, or fast for a month, or give one thousand dinars in charity’ or, ‘If I ever speak to So-and-So I have to free a slave, or divorce my wife,’ and so on, then he does the thing he said he would not do, but all he really meant by his words was that he would not do that thing – he had no intention of either doing it or the thing he vowed to do if he did. In such a case, this person – who made the vow for argument’s sake or to express the urgency of doing or refraining from something – has the choice of either fulfilling the vow, or expiating for it by offering kaffarat yamin, because his vow was essentially an oath (yamin). Ibn Taymiyah said: “If a vow is made in the form of an oath, such as saying, ‘If I travel with you then I have to go for Hajj, or give all my wealth in charity, or free a slave,’ in the opinion of the Sahabah and the majority of the scholars this is hilf al-nadhr (an oath by vowing), it is not a vow. If he does not do what he promised to do, it is sufficient for him to offer kaffarat yamin.” Elsewhere, he said, “The obligation of vows made in anger or desperation is one of two things, according to the majority: either expiation, or doing the thing promised. If he does not fulfill the vow, he must offer expiation (kaffarah).” Vows concerning permissible things. This means every vow that includes permissible things, such as vowing to wear a certain type of clothes, eat special foods, ride a certain animal, enter a certain house, and so on. Thabit ibn al-Dahhak said: “A man vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah (according to one report: because a male child had been born to him). He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ‘I have vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Was there one of the idols of the Jahiliyyah there that people used to worship?’ They said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Did they used to celebrate any of their festivals there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Then fulfill your vow, for there is no fulfillment of vows that involve disobedience to Allah, or that concern things that the son of Adam does not possess.’” (Reported by Abu Dawud, 2881) This man had vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah (a place beyond Yanbu') in thanksgiving to Allah, may He be exalted, because He had blessed him with a male child. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed him to fulfill his vow, so he sacrificed a camel in that place. We ask Allah to help us to do that which He loves and will please Him. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
135,Can a menstruating woman sit in a mosque in which Jumu’ah prayers are not held?,Question At lunchtime I stay in the mosque because of my work. Is it permissible for me to stay there during my monthly period? Please note that it does not have a minaret and Jumu’ah prayers are not held there.,"Praise be to Allah. It is haraam for a menstruating woman to stay in the mosque, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (974) and Muslim (890) from Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: He -- meaning the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) -- commanded us to bring out on the two Eids the girls who had attained puberty and those who were in seclusion, but he told the menstruating women to keep away from the prayer-place of the Muslims. So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade menstruating women to come to the Eid prayer place, and he told them to keep away from it, because it comes under the same rulings as the mosque. This indicates that a menstruating woman is not allowed to enter the mosque. This is the view of the majority of scholars. This has been discussed in the answers to questions number 33649 and 60213. There is no distinction between the mosque in which Jumu’ah prayer is held and one in which it is not held, or between one which has a minaret and one which does not. What matters is the fact that it is a mosque, i.e., a place that is devoted for prayer. With regard to prayer rooms in workplaces and schools, which remain the property of the owner and are not established as mosques per se, they do not come under the same rulings as mosques, so it is permissible for a menstruating woman to enter them and stay in them. The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: Does the prayer room in the university residence come under the same rulings as a mosque with regard to praying tahiyyat al-masjid (two sunnah rak’ahs performed upon entering to “greet the mosque”) and reciting the adhkaar for entering and leaving the mosque? They replied: Prayer rooms in university residences and elsewhere do not come under the same rulings as mosques in every aspect. End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (5/170). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about prayer rooms in schools that are set up for Zuhr prayer only: is it permissible for a menstruating woman to enter them? He replied: Prayer rooms in schools do not come under the same rulings as mosques. Rather they are prayer rooms. Not every place in which prayers are held is regarded as a mosque. The mosque is that which is set up for prayer in general and is built and prepared for that purpose. Simply taking a place as a place in which to pray does not make it a mosque. Based on that, it is permissible for a menstruating woman to enter and stay in the prayer room of a school. End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 22/27. To sum up: it is not permissible for you to sit in the mosque when you are menstruating, but it is permissible to do so in a prayer room that does not come under the same rulings as a mosque. And Allah knows best."
136,It is part of the Sunnah to turn one’s face towards the khateeb and look at him,"Question During the Friday khutbah, some of the worshippers look at the khateeb; some look straight ahead; some look at the ground; and some close their eyes. Is there a specific Sunnah regarding this matter?","Praise be to Allah. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that one of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mounted the minbar, we would turn our faces towards him. (al-Silsilat al_Saheehah by al-Albaani, no. 2080) It was narrated that Abaan ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajili said: I saw ‘Udayy ibn Thaabit turning to face the imaam when he stood to deliver the khutbah. I said to him, I saw you turn your face towards the imaam. He said, I saw the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) doing that. It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mounted the minbar, we would turn our faces towards him him. This was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said, in the same chapter there are reports narrated from Ibn ‘Umar and Muhammad ibn al-Fadl. According to the scholars among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others, this is to be followed. They regard it as mustahabb to turn to face the imaam when he delivers the khutbah. This is the view of Sufyaan al-Thawri, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Ishaaq. It was narrated that Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed al-Ansaari said: “The Sunnah when the imaam sits on the minbar on Friday is for all the people to turn their faces towards him.” It was narrated from Naafi’ that Ibn ‘Umar used to finish his tasbeeh before the imaam came out; when he came out, he would turn to face him before the imaam even sat down. Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) compiled these ahaadeeth in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, no. 2080, and commented on them. It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat on the minbar and we sat around him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 921) Al-Bukhaari narrated the hadeeth in “Chapter: The imaam facing the people, and the people turning their faces towards the imaam when he delivers the khutbah, and Ibn ‘Umar and Anas (may Allaah be pleased with them) turning their faces towards the imaam.” The point of the hadeeth is that the fact that they sat around him to listen to his words implies that they were looking at him in most cases. This is not affected by what was said earlier about the khateeb standing during the khutbah, because this implies that he used to speak whilst he was sitting in a high place and they were sitting at a lower point. If that was the case at times other than the khutbah, then it is more appropriate to do that at the time of the khutbah because there is the command to listen to it attentively. He said: “One of the reasons for their turning their faces towards the imaam is to facilitate their listening to his words, and to observe good manners when listening to him. If a person turn his face towards him with the proper physical posture and a focused mind, that will better enable them to understand his preaching and is in accordance with the reason why the khateeb is commanded to stand.” And Allaah knows best."
137,Ruling on doing wudoo’ with water that is contaminated but not naajis (ritually impure),"Question I would like to know whether it is allowed for a person to use water that maybe unclean for wudu. What if the water is not suitable for drinking due to it being unclean, can one rinse their mouth out with this water?","Praise be to Allah.This question was answered for us by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Munayyi’, who said: “One of the basic principles of sharee’ah is the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: ‘There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.’ Part of this principle is that the Muslim is not permitted to harm himself, which includes not using contaminated water for doing wudoo’. So it is forbidden to do wudoo’ using contaminated water, but if a person does do wudoo’ using such water his wudoo’ is still valid, because it is not naajis (ritually impure), but his action is haraam because he is harming himself. And Allaah knows best.”"
138,Problem between a daughter and her mother,"Question AssalmualaykumFor the past 23 years, i endured a lot of physical and mental abuse from my beloved mother. In all this time, i have tried very hard to swallow my pain and tolerate it , purely because she is my mother, regardless. But, sadly, now, at the age of 23 I am finding it very difficult to Tolerate it anymore. Her constant physical and verbal abuse has made me so ill, that i have been hospitalised for stress and been recommended to seek professional help. But i don't want to see a psychologist who would feed me with information and advice that is hostile to the Islamic point of view. I ma a very pious women,and know how highly regarded mothers are in Islam, and they have to be respected regardless. But what about me? Why have i done to deserve all this? Just recently, i have learnt, from my father, that she is mentally disturbed, and is a product of her hostile upbringing. But that still doesn't help me? As i write to you now, she sits outside in the lounge, and refuses to talk to me and works very hard to make my four sisters and brothers not talk to me either. Sadly, they comply, so not to make her upset. What really upsets me is that she curses me a lot and makes very bad du'oas for me, like wish that i die soon from a horrible disease or go to hell. My real concern is, how much of that would God listen to? What is God's opinion of me? What's His opinion of her? And what do i do now? Please help and and let me know what my rights and obligations are as a Muslim daughter. Can mothers do that just because they are mothers and paradise lay under their feet? What about the children? Jazak allah khayra","Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to treat our parents well, and He has linked this to the command to worship Him and the prohibition of associating anything in worship with Him. The rights of the mother in this regard have been emphasized more than those of the father. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Worship none but Allaah (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents [al-Baqarah 2:83]. Ibn Abbaas said: This means treating them with respect and kindness, and lowering the wing of humility to them, not answering them harshly or glaring at them, not raising one's voice to them, but being as humble towards them as a slave towards his master. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, not shout at them, but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small. [al-Isra 17:23-24]. Al-Baghawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This means not saying anything that may contain the slightest hint of irritation. [The word uff in the aayah, translated here as a word of disrepect] comes from the word aff, which is similar to the word taff; both words refer to the dirt that collects under fingernails, and [in Arabic] when one is annoyed and fed up with something, one says uff! to it. Abu Baddaah al-Tajeebi said: I said to Saeed ibn al-Musayyab: I understood everything in the Quraan about respecting ones parents, apart from the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) But address them in terms of honour [al-Isra 17:23]. What are these terms of honour [al-qawl al-kareem]? Ibn al-Musayyab said: It is the way in which a slave who has done wrong approaches a harsh and strict master. The obligation of treating ones parents with kindness and respect is not confined only to Muslim parents; they should be honoured in this way even if they are kaafirs. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years give thanks to Me and to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:14-15]. If Allaah has told us to treat even these parents with respect and kindness, in spite of the heinous sin which they are telling their child to commit, which is the crime of associating something in worship with Allaah, then what do you think is the case with Muslim parents, especially if they are righteous? By Allaah, their rights are among the most important and most certain rights, and fulfilling these rights in a proper manner is one of the most difficult and most important duties. The one who is guided to do this is truly guided, and the one who is not helped to do this is truly deprived. Innumerable ahaadeeth also confirm this. According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him): A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, who among the people is most deserving of my good companionship? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said, Then your father. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4/13, and Muslim, 2548). Makhool said: Respecting ones parents is an expiation for major sins. You have to be patient with your mother and put up with the harsh treatment on her part, which is upsetting you. By treating her with respect and dealing with her kindly, you will earn her good pleasure and love. Try to avoid things that will provoke her and make her angry, even if they are in your interests, without causing harm to yourself. Your mother, for her part, has to treat you well and stop harming you with her blows and insults. With regard to what you mention about her praying against you, if these duaas are said for no good reason, they will not be accepted. It is not permissible for her to pray against you for no good reason, because of the general applicability of the Prophets words: [The prayers] of any of you will be answered, so long as he does not pray for sin or the breaking of family ties. This hadeeth indicates that if a duaa includes sin, it will definitely not be answered. There is no doubt that praying against ones child for no good reason is a sin. We ask Allaah to help you to treat her with respect and earn her pleasure, and to help us all to do that which He loves and will please Him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
139,Should she ask for a divorce from her husband who does not pray regularly and does not give her her rights?,"Question A young man came to propose marriage to me who is of a lower educational status than me, and he only got his high-school diploma, whereas I am at university, so I refused. His mother claimed that he has a diploma in English, then after that I found out that he does not know any English at all. She said that he is employed with a salary of 4000 riyals, and that this salary would be enough because his grandfather would give him an apartment as a gift. The marriage went ahead, but after that I found out that he owes debts to the bank which is deducted from his salary, and he gives me only 100 riyals per month. Three months ago he left his job and has not found another job. We have not moved to the apartment that his grandfather gave him even though it is now one year and four months since we got married, because he cannot spend on me. Rather we are living with his family. In addition to that he is heedless with regard to prayer and he only prays when I ask him to. He also very fat which prevents me from finding any pleasure with him. He does not pay any attention to personal hygiene and I am put off by him.","Praise be to Allah.Marriage is one of the signs and blessings of Allaah, in which both spouses find peace, companionship, love and compassion, as well as keeping themselves chaste and producing righteous children to populate the earth in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect” [al-Room 30:21] These are the purposes for which marriage has been prescribed. If these aims are not achieved, then divorce is a means that is permitted in Islam, in order for the spouses to move onto a new marriage in which they may attain the aims and purposes of marriage. What you have mentioned makes it permissible for you to ask for divorce. Al-Tirmidhi (1187) narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce without a reason, the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden to her.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. The phrase “without a reason” means without any hardship that makes her ask for a separation. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The wife should behave in a reasonable manner and listen to and obey her husband in that which is right and proper, and she should not ask for a divorce with no reason. If there is a reason, there is nothing wrong with that, such as if he is miserly and does not give her her rights, or he commits a great deal of sin, such as drinking and the like, or if he stays up at night a great deal and neglects her right to intimacy, and other such reasons. These are valid reasons (for divorce). End quote from Fataawa al-Talaaq, p. 264. Although the reasons that you mention make it permissible for you to ask for divorce, you should think long and hard about this matter before doing it, and pay attention to a number of things: 1 – Hope that he will improve, especially if you move to your own apartment. If you encourage him to pray regularly, perhaps Allaah will grant him a good provision and he will try to please you and give up the things that are upsetting you. Then you would have the reward for being patient and treating him well, and for helping him to change himself. So check yourself and think about your husband. If you hope that he can change, then be patient and seek reward with Allaah, and remember that patience brings relief and success. How many women have put up with their husbands and their bad treatment, then Allaah has changed them and they have become among the best of husbands, who did not forget their wives’ patience and kindness. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allaah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. 35. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient — and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world” [Fussilat 41:34, 35] The woman can play a great role in reforming her husband and calling him to goodness and success, if she uses wisdom, kindness and good methods. First of all she should focus on religious matters, before physical and material issues. If his religious commitment improves, he will be helped and guided in all his affairs, by Allaah’s leave and grace. 2 – You should think of what your own situation will be if divorce happens. This is something to which no attention is paid at times of anger or when one is put off by one's husband. Rather it needs deep thought. The wise woman may accept a hard life with a husband in whom there is both good and bad, and she may prefer that to being divorced, suffering from loneliness and anxiety and looking for a husband at a time when many women are single and it is difficult for virgins to get married, let alone divorced women. This varies from one woman to another. A divorced woman may still be sought for her religious commitment, beauty, wealth or lineage. 3 – You should turn to Allaah a great deal and ask Him to guide you and ward off evil from you. Do not make a decision until you have prayed to your Lord for guidance (istikhaarah). For information on the istikhaarah prayer, please see question no. 11981 and 2217. We ask Allaah to help you to do that which is good and right and will lead to success. And Allaah knows best."
140,Whoever adds or takes away a letter from the Qur’an deliberately has committed an act of kufr (disbelief),"Question Sometimes during the exam the student is asked to quote a verse from the Qur’an, and because he has forgotten a letter or a word, he deliberately substitutes another word for the word that he has forgotten, because he wants to pass the exam and is afraid of failing. Although he knows that what he has written is a distortion, his aim is not really to distort the Qur’an; rather it is because he is afraid of failing, so he put that word in the place of the word that he had forgotten of the Qur’an. Is this regarded as distorting the Qur’an which would mean that the student has gone out of Islam?","Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 158204 we stated that if a person makes a mistake in reciting a soorah, or forgets something of it, whilst he is praying, then he should try to correct the mistake and remember what he forgot. If he is not able to do that, then he may skip that verse and move on to the next one, or he may stop reciting that soorah and start reciting a different one. But if he adds to the Qur’an something that is not part of it deliberately – whether that is during the prayer or otherwise, then this is emphatically forbidden and the scholars have stated that whoever omits a letter of the Qur’an or substitutes a different letter or adds a letter has committed an act of kufr. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Muslims are unanimously that the Qur’an which is recited in all corners of the earth, and is written in the Mushaf between the two covers by the hands of the Muslims, from the beginning of Soorat al-Faatihah to the end of Soorat an-Naas is indeed the word of Allah and His Revelation that He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); that everything in it is truth; and that anyone who deliberately omits a letter of it, or substitutes one letter for another, or adds to it a letter that is not included in the Mushaf on which there is consensus, and there is consensus that it is not part of the Qur’an, has committed an act of kufr. End quote from ash-Shifa, 2/304-305; see also at-Taqreer wa’t-Tahbeer by Ibn Ameer al-Haaj, 2/215 It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/214: The Qur’an is the word of Allah, the miracle that was sent down to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and was transmitted by means of tawaatur (i.e., it was narrated from so many people by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie). It is haram to deliberately make mistakes in it, whether that changes the meaning or not, because its words and phrases are tawqeefi (i.e., to be accepted and recited as they were revealed, and they cannot be altered) and it was transmitted to us by means of tawaatur. It is not permissible to change any word of it by altering the vowels or changing the letters, replacing one letter with another. End quote. Based on that, it is not permissible for a student to write a word or a letter that he knows is not part of the Qur’an or that does not belong in this verse; rather he should either try hard to remember, or he should leave the parts that he has forgotten blank. He can also apologize for that by explaining that he forgot where this word goes and that he did not want to write something of which he was not certain in this case. And Allah knows best."
141,Meaning of Al-Mala al-A’ala,Question I am a non-Muslim who is currently enrolled in class studying Muslim traditions. I am writing a paper on the interpretation of prophets by commentators. One of the words being repeated is al-mala al-a'ala. I do not know what this means. I know that al-a'ala means the most high. Could you please help me with this? I appreciate your time and your help.,"Praise be to Allah. The phrase al-mala al-a’ala is mentioned in both the Quran and the sunnah (prophetic teachings). In Surah Saad, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing (about the creation of Adam). Only this has been inspired to me, that I am a plain warner.’"" [38:69-70] In his commentary on this ayah (verse), Shaykh al-Mufassireen Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high (al-mala al-a’ala) when they were disputing and discussing’: here Allah is telling His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , ‘O Muhammad, say to the mushrikeen (polytheists) among your people: ""I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing"" about the creation of Adam before Allah revealed this to me.’ What this means is: ‘My telling you about this is clear proof that this Quran is a Revelation from Allah, because you know that I had no knowledge of this before this Quran was revealed; it is not something I witnessed with my own two eyes – I know it only because Allah has informed me of it.’"" Other scholars of tafseer (exegesis) have said something similar to this. The comments of other scholars: Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: ""Allah’s words (interpretation of the meaning) ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, when they were consulted about the creation of Adam, and they disputed it and said: Do not place a khaleefah (vicegerent) on earth."" Al-Sa’adi said: ""‘… The chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ means: ‘… when your Lord said to the angels: ""Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth""…’ [2:30] Qutadah said: ""The words ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, who disputed the creation of Adam when Allah said to them, (interpretation of the meaning) ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay’.” [38:71]. As regards what was reported in the sunnah, Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah spoke to him in a dream and said, ""O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high are disputing about?… about the things which expiate for sins. Things that expiate for sins are: staying in the mosque after the prayers, walking to join congregational prayers and performing wudu properly when it is difficult to do so. Whoever does these things will have a good life and die a good death, and he will be as free from sin as on the day his mother bore him."" [Al-Tirmidhi]) In his commentary on this hadeeth (narration), al-Mubarakpuri explained that ""the chiefs on high"" (al-mala al-a’ala) referred to the angels who are closest to Allah. Al-mala refers to nobles who attend gatherings and sit at their head because of their high status. They are described as al-a’ala either because they live on high, or because of their high status in the sight of Allah. Their ""dispute"" refers either to their competing or rushing to record these deeds and take them up to heaven, or to their discussing the virtue and blessing of these deeds, or to their feeling happy about people when they do these good deeds. It may have been called a ""dispute"" because it came in the form of questions and answers, which sounds like a dispute or a debate, hence it was appropriate to use the word ""dispute"" in this context. And Allah knows best."
142,Imagining intercourse between spouses,Question Can a husband or wife think sexually with the one's spouse when they are apart i.e. far away for time being.,"Praise be to Allah.Yes it is permissible for each spouse to think of the other, but we must explain the following points with regard to this matter: 1 – The Muslim should not keep away from his wife for more than six months, as stipulated by Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), as was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in his Musannaf, 7/152. If a Muslim is away for longer than that, then both parties may fall into temptation and be affected by whispers from the Shaytaan. This may lead to thinking about haraam things, and after thinking about such things he may be provoked into satisfying his desires, and this may lead him to falling into haraam – Allaah forbid. Desire has power over a person’s mind and this may lead him to look at pictures or haraam things. 2 – The Muslim must break the power of his desire by fasting, lowering his gaze, avoiding temptation and turning away from it. He must fear Allaah as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy” [al-Baqarah 2:168] 3 – Another issue that has to do with this topic is that it is not permissible for a woman to describe another (non-mahram) woman to her husband, so that he will not imagine her as if he is looking at her. It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should look at or touch another woman to describe her to her husband as if he can see her.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4942). And Allaah knows best."
143,"Her husband divorced her and she got her period on the same day that the divorce papers were signed, then he took her back with a text message after three months",Question i have a question and i will be greatful if u can answer me as soon as possible because currently the decision has to be taken immediately.My friend husband has given her divorce in india.he legally signed the papers in front of two witnesses.the divorce was named as TALAQ E BAEEIN. And my friend was in state of menses the day he signed that day her periods began.She was told to wait for her iddah to get over and accordingly if we take that day of menses she finished her iddah.Now after three months he has sent her text message formally annoucing that he has taken her into his nikah back as his wife. My question is 1-is talaq e baeein it the first or second or third divorce.As he has not uttered the words before also wen she was in nikaah. 2-can he take back his wife by just a mobile sms. 3-plz tell me if the divorce is valid if she is menstruating. Plz help me in the light of Quran and Sunnah.,"Praise be to Allah.140315 Ruling on kissing and embracing one wife in front of her co-wives! . Firstly: Revocable divorce is the first or second talaaq, so long as it is not talaaq in return for money (i.e., so long as it is not khula‘). Then this revocable divorce is counted as one of the three talaaqs, and it is permissible to take the wife back during her ‘iddah, even if that is without her consent, with no new marriage contract or mahr; rather the original marriage contract remains in effect. As for irrevocable divorce (at-talaaq al-baa’in), it is divided into two types, major and minor. Irrevocable divorce in the major sense means that the husband has completed three talaaqs, as a result of which the marriage contract between them comes to an end, and it is not permissible for him to marry her again until after she has married another husband in a genuine marriage, not a tahleel marriage (one aimed making it permissible for her to go back to the first husband), then the second husband divorces her or passes away. Irrevocable divorce in the minor sense refers to cases where talaaq is issued in return for compensation, or it occurs before consummation of the marriage, or where the husband has issued one or two talaaqs and has not taken her back before her ‘iddah ended. As a consequence of that, the marriage contract between them comes to an end, but it is possible for the husband to remarry her with her consent, and with a new marriage contract and mahr. This has been explained previously in fatwa no. 46561. Hence it is known that this talaaq that your friend signed for his wife is a revocable talaaq, so long as it did not happen in return for money, and was not a third talaaq, as appears to be the case from your question. Secondly: The ‘iddah of a woman divorced by talaaq varies according to her situation. This has been explained previously in detail in fatwa no. 12667 So long as this woman menstruates, as is mentioned in the question, then her ‘iddah is according to her menstrual cycle. So what she must do is wait until she has had three menstrual cycles after her divorce, including the menses that came on the day of the talaaq, if he divorced her before her menses began, as we shall see below. If her husband took her back during this ‘iddah, i.e., before her third menses, then she is still his wife. But if he took her back after the end of the ‘iddah, then in that case the taking back is not valid, and she has become irrevocable divorce in the minor sense. Thirdly: The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that taking back the wife is valid if done by means of words to that effect, such as if he says to her: “I take you back” or “I take her back”. However they differed as to whether taking back may be achieved by means of actions, such as intercourse and the things that lead to it, e.g., touching, kissing, being alone together. This has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 23269. You say that your friend sent her a text message saying that he was taking her back. If he intended to take her back by means of this message, then it was fulfilled thereby. The scholars have stated that writing down the taking back, with the intention of doing so, counts as taking back. It says in I‘aanat al-Taalibeen ‘ala Hall Alfaaz Fath al-Ma‘een (4/34): Writing may take the place of speaking, if accompanied by the intention. End quote. However we should point out that just as it is not necessary to have the wife’s consent to taking her back, it is also not necessary to inform her of it; rather even if he takes her back without her knowledge, the taking back is still valid, and she is obliged to comply with the implications of his taking her back once she is certain of his claim to have taken her back during the ‘iddah, or once he establishes proof for her. It says in Badaa’i‘ as-Sanaa’i‘ fi Tarteeb ash-Sharaa’i‘ (3/181): Similarly, informing her that he is taking her back is not an essential condition; even if he does not tell her that he is taking her back, that is acceptable, because taking back is his right exclusively. End quote. Fourthly: Issuing a talaaq during menses is a sin and an act of disobedience; it is contrary to the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). As to whether it is applicable to the wife, that is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. We have discussed this difference of opinion previously; for information on the most correct view, please see fatwa no. 72417 This difference of opinion is of concern if the husband issued a divorce to his wife at the time when she was menstruating. As for completing the official procedures and filing the divorce papers, that has nothing to do with whether the woman is menstruating or not. If he divorced her during a period of purity in which he had not had intercourse with her, but the divorce papers were signed when she was menstruating, then this divorce was done in accordance with the Sunnah and counts as such, according to scholarly consensus, even if she got her menses on the same day, after he had actually divorced her. And Allah knows best."
144,He is afraid that he caused his wife’s death,"Question My wife died recently (pregnancy complications) and during the 5-8 months pregnancy period, me and my wife quarreled on some issue and I did not telephone her for 3 months. When she was admitted to the hospital due to her serious condition, I came back from Saudi Arabia and I met my wife in the hospital and we forgot about our issue of quarrel. I kissed her and spent a lot of time in the hospital sitting with her and pursuaded her that, In sha Allah, she will be alright and I spent nearly 15,000 S.R towards medical expenses but she died. Q:1) Did she die because I was not talking to her on the telephone and she took this matter seriously in her heart ? Q:2) My mother-in-law blames me for the cause of her daughter's heart because I was not sending sufficient money for her because my mother wants my wife to stay in our home rather than staying with her parents. My mother told me that if I send money she will not come back to our house, so I used to send only a little money. Could that be the cause of my wife's dealth as my mother-in-law said ? Please help me and I feel very much guilty upon hearing my mother-in-law's words as I can not sleep properly and am feeling quilty. It was a love marriage and we quarreled on small issues sometimes, but I never wanted her death.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: wWe ask Allah to shower your wife with His mercy and to record for her the reward of martyrdom, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Martyrdom is of seven types besides being killed (in jihad) for the sake of Allah,” ...and among them he mentioned the woman who dies because of pregnancy or childbirth. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3111; al-Nasai, 1846; classed as saheeh by al-Albani. And we ask Him to help you and her family to bear this loss with patience and to compensate you in this world and in the Hereafter. Secondly: There is no doubt that life and death are in the hand of Allah and that the time of death and life-spans are decreed by His will. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed” [al-Mulk 67:2] “La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). It is He Who gives life and causes death” [al-A’raf 7:158] No one has the power to benefit or harm another except by Allah’s leave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Holy Spirit inspired to me that no soul will ever depart this world until it has completed its allotted time and used up its allotted provision, so do not be too desperate when seeking provision. If you feel that provision is slow in coming, do not try to hasten it by disobeying Allah, for that which is with Allah can only be attained by obeying Him.” Narrated by al-Tabarani, 8/166; classed as hasan by al-Albani). Thirdly: Islam enjoins kindness. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has prescribed kindness in all one’s affairs.” Narrated by Muslim, 1955. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) even spoke of a woman who went to Hell because of a cat that she detained until it died. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2365; Muslim, 2242. To what degree then do you think Islam enjoins kindness towards one's wife– one’s companion in this world and in the Hereafter? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I urge you to treat women kindly.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3331; Muslim, 1468. Al-Imam al-Tirmidhi narrated a hadeeth (1163) which he classed as hasan, and al-Albani agreed with him, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, during the Farewell Pilgrimage: “They (women) are like prisoners in your hands.” It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most complete in faith of the believers are those who have the best attitude, and the best of you are those who are best towards their womenfolk.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1162; classed as hasan by al-Albani. Fourthly: If you know from the above that you fell short in your duty towards your wife, by cutting off communication with her when she was sick and was most in need of you, and the quarrel between you was about some minor issue, as you mention, then how could you fall short in spending on her, for spending on one’s wife is obligatory according to the Quran and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus, as it says in al-Mughni (9/229)? If your mother told you to do something other than that, you should not have obeyed her, because there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. Your feelings of shortcoming and sin are appropriate. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Righteousness is a good attitude, and wrongdoing is that which wavers in your heart and which you dislike people finding out about.” Narrated by Muslim, 2553. But this sin should not be regarded as the cause of your wife’s death, because it is not directly connected to it and such things do not usually kill a person. You mentioned in your question that she died because of complications in pregnancy. And you did well – may Allah reward you with good – by sitting with her in her last days and spending on her. Your doing these things will be an expiation for you in sha Allah. Our advice to you is to pray a great deal for forgiveness for yourself and for her, and make du’a for her, give in charity on her behalf, honour her family and uphold your ties with them and treat them kindly; put up with any bad treatment you may encounter from them because of the loss of their daughter; and let what happened be a lesson for the future so that it does not happen again. And Allah knows best."
145,No zakaah is due on money if you are not certain that you will get it.,"Question We are employees in a petroleum company in Saudi. We were sent abroad for three years. Five years after we returned we knew that we have financial rights for the years we were abroad. We complained to the individuals in charge, doubting that we will get these rights. One year later we were given these amounts. Do we have to pay Zakat on them? If yes then shall it be for six years (since we returned) or for one year only which is the year we complained during? As we received the money in the end of this sixth year.","Praise be to Allah. If the situation is as you describe in your question, then you do not have to pay zakaah, because you are not certain that you will get this money. It is like a debt owed by one who is going through financial difficulties. The correct view is that no zakaah is due on it until its owner takes possession of it and one full year has passed. The same applies to the money that you mention; no zakaah is due on it until one year has passed since you took possession of it. End quote. Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz (14/39). It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Ifta’: If the debtor is in financial hardship or is well off but he is taking a long time to pay it back, and the debtor cannot get it back from him, either because he has no proof that would enable him to prove his rights before a judge, or because he has proof but there is no one in authority who can help him to get his rights back, as happens in some countries where there is no support for people’s rights, then the debtor does not have to pay zakaah until he has taken possession of what is owed to him and one hijri year has passed. But if the debtor is well off and it is possible to get the debt back from him, then the creditor must pay zakaah every time one year passes, if the debt by itself or in addition to other money etc reaches the nisaab. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (9/191). And Allaah knows best."
146,Muhrim covering his head and using an umbrella for shade,"Question During hajj, is it permissible to use an umbrella that covers the head and prtects the body from the heat of the sun? this umbrella is however held by supports from the shoulder leaving the two hands free.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The scholars are agreed that covering the head is haraam for a man in ihraam. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning a man who died in ‘Arafah when he was in ihraam: “Wash him with water and lotus leaves, and shroud him in two cloths, and do not put any perfume on him or cover his head, for Allah will resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1267; Muslim, 1206. Al-Bukhaari (1542) and Muslim (1177) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said, “O Messenger of Allah, what garments should the muhrim wear?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He should not wear a shirt, or a turban, or pants, or a burnoose or khifaaf (shoes).” The burnoose is a garment worn by the people of the Maghreb (North Africa) which has a hood attached. Secondly: The muhrim’s covering his head is of various kinds: 1 – Covering it with something that stays on the head, such as a hat or turban and the like. This is haraam. The evidence for it being haraam is the two hadeeth quoted above. 2 – Covering his head with something that does not stay on it, such as an umbrella, tent, car roof etc. There is nothing wrong with this, because Umm Husayn (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and I saw him when he stoned Jamarat al-‘Aqabah and went away on his mount, accompanied by Bilaal and Usaamah. One of them was leading his mount and the other was holding his garment over the head of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), shading him from the sun. Narrated by Muslim, 1298. Al-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is permissible for the muhrim to shade his head with a cloth or whatever. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: this is exactly like an umbrella. Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: There is nothing wrong with the muhrim using an umbrella to shield himself from the sun, or shading himself in a tent or under the roof of a car. Fatawa Ibn Baaz, 17/115. 3 – Carrying one’s luggage on one's head. There is nothing wrong with this because it is usually not done with the intention of covering the head. If it is done with that intention then it is haraam. Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: Carrying luggage is not covering the head, it is like the muhrim carrying food and the like, so long as he is not doing that as a trick (to get around the ruling), because Allah has forbidden His slaves to use trickery in order to do things that He has forbidden. Fatawa Ibn Baaz, 17/115 And Allah knows best."
147,Is it obligatory for the husband to provide medical treatment for his wife?,"Question If the wife becomes temporarily or chronically ill, does the husband have to pay for her treatment? If she for example, wants to have children but suffers from problems preventing her from having children, does her husband have to seek treatment for her and pay for it? If it is not compulsory on the husband to do so, then what shall the wife do if she becomes ill while she does not have money and her husband doesn’t give her money to save?.","Praise be to Allah.According to the majority of fuqaha’ from the four madhhabs, the husband is not obliged to pay for medical treatment for his wife. Some of them gave the reason for that as being that it is not one of the essential needs, rather it is something extraneous. Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Umm (8/337): The man is not obliged to offer a sacrifice on behalf of his wife or to pay the fee of a doctor or cupper for her. End quote. It says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat (3/227): He is not obliged to provide medicine or pay the fee of a doctor if she falls sick, because these are not essential needs, rather they are incident and are not obligatory. End quote See: Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen (3/575); Sharh al-Kharashi ‘ala Mukhtasar Khaleel (4/178). The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked (21/169) about a man providing medical treatment for his wife. They replied: There is evidence in the Qur'aan and Sunnah which enjoins kind treatment of people in general and of those who are close to one in particular. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allaah enjoins Al‑‘Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allaah Alone — Islamic Monotheism) and Al‑Ihsân [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allaah, totally for Allaah’s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet صلىالله عليه وسلم in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin” [al-Nahl 16:90] “Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masaakeen (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allaah does not like such as are proud and boastful” [al-Nisa’ 4:36] And it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of you is the one who is best to his family, and I am the best of you to my family.” So the Muslim must treat his family well and be kind to them. But the cost of medical treatment is not an obligation upon the husband like maintenance and accommodation. But it is prescribed for him to spend on that when he is able to, because of the general meaning of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably”[al-Nisa’ 4:19]. And because of the general meaning of the hadeeth quoted above. End quote. Some of the scholars are of the view that it is obligatory for the husband to spend on his wife’s medical expenses, because that comes under the heading of kind treatment, and because the need for medicine may be no less than the need for food and drink. Dr. Wahbah al-Zuhayli said: The fuqaha’ of the four madhhabs stated that the husband is not obliged to pay for the medical expenses of the sick wife, such as the fees of the doctor and cupper, or the cost of the medicine, rather those expenses should be paid from her wealth if she has any wealth. If she does not have any wealth then it must be paid by one who is obliged to spend on her (such as a son, father or relative who would inherit from her), because medicine is aimed at preserving the body, so it is not required of the one who benefits from it. This is like maintenance of a building for the tenant – it is required from the landlord, not the tenant. It seems to me that in the past, medical treatment was not a basic need, so people did not usually need medical treatment, because they followed health rules and precautions. So the ijtihaad of the fuqaha’ was based on the prevalent custom during their era. But now the need for medical treatment has become like the need for food and nourishment, and even more important, because the sick person usually gives his medicine precedence over everything else. Can he eat when he is suffering pain which causes extreme anguish and exhausts him and threatens him with death? Hence I think that medical expenses are obligatory upon the husband like all other necessary expenses. Is it kind treatment for the husband to enjoy his wife when she is healthy, then to send her back to her family for them to treat her when she is sick? End quote from al-Fiqh al-Islami wa Adillatuhu (10/7380). Shaykh Hamad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Hamad said in Sharh Zaad al-Mustaqni’: The second view concerning this issue is one of the views in our madhhab, that this (paying medical expenses) is required of the husband, and this is more correct, because that is part of kindness and good treatment, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably” [al-Nisa’ 4:19]. It is not part of kind or honourable treatment to let the wife get sick and not bring her a doctor or pay his fee. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable” [al-Baqarah 2:228]. So the correct view is that this is obligatory. End quote. And Allaah knows best."
148,"She became Muslim and got married, but herm other is still receiving a pension","Question I was a Christian but I married a Muslim man before a lawyer, until I can get the official papers and register the marriage. Until now my mother is still receiving a pension which includes a living allowance for me – what is the ruling on that?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We congratulate you for this great blessing, the blessing of Islam and guidance. We ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to help and guide you, and to guide all of your family at your hands, for He is able to do that. Secondly: Concerning the pension, reference should be made to the rules concerning it in your country. If the rules state that it should be stopped or a part of it should be stopped when daughters get married or when the children reach a certain age and so on, then they should be followed. If your getting married or becoming Muslim means that your mother will lose her pension, then you should explain that to her and advise her to inform the department that deals with that. We advise you to read Qur’aan and learn the rulings of Islam, and offer prayers on time, and treat your family, relatives and neighbours well. We ask Allaah to help and guide you. We would be happy to answer more questions from you. And Allaah knows best."
149,Ruling on eating certain foods only in Ramadan,"Question Here in Egypt, during the blessed month of Ramadan, we have some foods that are eaten specifically during this month, such as kunafah (a vermicelli-like pastry), qatayef (a kind of sweet dumpling), qamar ad-deen (apricot nectar), mukassarat (mixed nuts), yamish (a combination of dried fruits and nuts usually mixed with milk) and so on. There is a seeker of knowledge in the area where we live who says that it is not permissible to eat these foods specifically in the month of worship, because having some customs that are done specifically in the month of worship is a kind of innovation, especially since there is nothing in these foods that help the fasting person to fast. So they do not come under the heading of tangible or shar‘i means. Based on that, he says that eating the foods mentioned is haraam in Ramadan, but not at other times of the year, and he says that he read that one of the shaykhs in Egypt said that. What is the ruling on this matter?","Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with the custom that some people have of eating certain kinds of food during the month of Ramadan, sweets and other things, and it does not come under the heading of innovation, because they are not seeking to draw closer to Allah by singling out these foods in this month; rather it is a matter of custom and tradition. Innovation (bid‘ah) has to do with introducing things into the religion, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces something into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2697) and Muslim (1718). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours, will have it rejected.” Narrated by Muslim (1718). “Additional bid‘ah (bid‘ah idaafiyyah)” is, as ash-Shaatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: An innovated practice that is introduced into the religion that is similar to prescribed practices, where the aim behind adhering to it is the same as the aim behind following the prescribed practice. One example of that is consistently doing specific acts of worship at specific times for which there is no evidence in the texts of sharee‘ah, such as always fasting the fifteenth day of Sha‘baan and spending the night of the fifteenth in prayer (qiyaam). End quote from al-I‘tisaam (1/51). As for adhering to certain customs or traditions at certain times, that is not included in the definition of bid‘ah. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5403) it is narrated that Sahl ibn Sa‘d said: We used to look forward to Friday because there was an old woman of our acquaintance who would take the roots of silq (a variety of chard) and put them in a cooking pot of hers with some grains of barley. When we had prayed, we would visit her and she would offer that food to us. We used to look forward to Friday because of that, and we would not eat lunch or take a siesta until after Jumu‘ah. By Allah, there was no fat in it. In this hadith we see that this Sahaabi woman used to make that food of hers only on Friday, and the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to look forward to Friday and feel happy when it came, because of this food that they would eat in this lady’s house. Can it be said that this was an innovation? Or, what is the difference between the food that is traditionally made in the month of Ramadan, and what the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to eat on Fridays? Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If we pay attention to what is said about customs and traditions being innovations (bid‘ahs) that have been introduced, then everything that did not exist at the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the time of his companions – whether types of food, drink, clothing, means of transportation, and all other inventions that were introduced into daily life after that time – should be regarded as reprehensible innovations! Such a notion is extremely flawed and incorrect, and reflects complete ignorance of the fundamentals and objectives of Islam. What the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said about the meaning of innovation is perfectly clear. It is obvious to people of insight and understanding that what is meant by the innovated or introduced matters that are to be rejected is matters having to do with religion, such as adding something to it, or adhering to some practices to which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not adhere. End quote from Fataawa ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (2/128). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The difference between traditions and worship is that worship is what Allah and His Messenger have enjoined as a means of drawing closer to Allah and seeking His reward. As for traditions, these are things that people customarily do in matters of food, drink, housing, clothing, means of transportation, interactions with one another, and so on. There is another difference, which is that the basic principle with regard to acts of worship is that they are not allowed and are forbidden, unless there is evidence to prove that they are acts of worship, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Or have they other deities who have ordained for them a religion to which Allah has not consented?” [ash-Shoora 42:21]. As for traditions and customs, the basic principle is that they are permissible, unless there is evidence to prove that they are not allowed. Based on that, if people have a custom or tradition that they follow, and someone tells them that it is haraam, he should be asked for proof, and it should be said to him: Where is the proof that it is haraam? With regard to acts of worship, if it is said to someone that this act of worship is an innovation (bid‘ah) and he says that it is not, we say to him: Where is the proof that it is not an innovation, because the basic principle with regard to acts of worship is that they are not allowed, unless there is proof to indicate that they are prescribed? End quote from Liqaa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (2/72). He also said: With regard to what is an innovation in shar‘i terms, the guideline is that it is seeking to worship Allah in a way that Allah has not prescribed. If you wish, you may say that it is worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, in a way that was not practised by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or by the Rightly Guided Caliphs. So everyone who worships Allah by doing something that Allah has not prescribed, or by doing something that was not the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or the Rightly Guided Caliphs who succeeded him, is an innovator, whether that act of worship has to do with the names and attributes of Allah, or it has to do with His rulings and laws. But with regard to day-to-day matters that have to do with custom and tradition, these cannot be called innovations in religious terms, even if they are called innovations in linguistic terms; they are not innovations in religion, and they are not what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned us against.

150,Will he be rewarded for memorizing the Qur’an if he memorizes it from an audio recording?,Question I cannot read the quran and I want to compete with my brothers for rewards. Which dhikrs' can I say that will bring the greatest rewards? If I memorize qur'an from audio will I get rewarded for reciting?,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: You should bear in mind these two important matters, which are from the bounty of Allah that He has bestowed upon His slaves. The first is that Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember, then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?” [al-Qamar 54:17]. The second is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is skilled in reciting Qur’an will be with the noble, honourable scribes and the one who recites Qur’an and falters therein, and finds it difficult, will have a double reward.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4937) and Muslim (798). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The one who falters is the one who stumbles in his recitation because of his poor memorisation. He will have a double reward: the reward for reciting and the reward for faltering in his recitation and the difficulty he encounters. End quote. If we learn that the Qur’an is easy to remember and understand, and we learn that the one for whom any of that is difficult to learn, memorize or understand will have a double reward – once this is established, it will be appropriate for the wise person to strive his utmost to achieve that and to show patience in seeking to attain this sublime goal. How often has Allah made it easy for non-Arabs who do not speak Arabic well to memorize His Book in its entirety. To achieve this great virtue it is worth spending a great deal of time and competing with others. Secondly: One of the things that help one to memorize the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, is listening to it often on recordings. If it is easy for you to memorize it in this way, then you will become one of those who have memorized the Book of Allah, attained that goal and earned the reward and status of the hafiz, by Allah’s leave. The individual’s precision in recitation, memorization and acting upon the Holy Book and its rulings and teachings will determine his reward and his status before Allah, if he is sincere in his intention and seeks reward with Him. However it is better to combine two things in that regard: striving to recite it and to memorize whatever you are able to whilst looking at the Mushaf, so as to attain the virtue of reading it yourself and the virtue of looking in the Mushaf. Then by listening to a recording of the Qur’an you will be able to do two things: correct your recitation and make sure that you have got it right before memorizing it, and then continue revising it and reminding yourself of what you have memorized after that. Undoubtedly the one who listens to the recitation by his shaykh or teacher directly will learn the Book of Allah more precisely than the one who listens to it from a recording. The Muslim cannot memorize properly unless he learns directly from a shaykh and attends his classes whenever he can. But for the one who does not have access to a shaykh but does have access to a recording, there is nothing wrong with him listening to it and memorizing in that manner. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 112763 and 147816 Thirdly: Competing and hastening to reward is something that is open to everyone. The one who cannot compete in memorizing and reciting Qur’an can compete in prayer, fasting, giving charity, remembering Allah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, doing good deeds, upholding ties of kinship, honouring parents or other innumerable types of righteous deeds. All of the proven, prescribed adhkaar bring a great reward, but there are some that bring a greater reward. In the case of the Qur’an – which is the best dhikr – reciting Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (i.e., Soorat al-Ikhlaas 112) is equivalent to one third of the Qur’an. Soorat al-Faatihah is the best soorah and Ayat al-Kursiy (al-Baqarah 2:255) is the best verse. Whoever recites the last two verses of Soorat al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him. Memorizing these passages and others is something that everyone can do, and in reciting them and repeating them there is a great deal of reward. Other adhkaar include the following: ·That which was narrated by Muslim (2729) from Juwayriyah, who said that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) left her house one morning when he prayed Fajr, and she was in her prayer-place, then he came back after the forenoon had come, and she was still sitting there. He said: “Are you still as you were when I left you?” She said: Yes. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “After I left you I said four words three times, which if they were weighed against what you have said today, they would outweigh it: ‘Subhan Allah wa bi hamdih, ‘adada khalqihi, wa rida nafsihi, wazinata ‘arshihi, wa midaada kalimatihi (Glory and praise be to Allah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of His words).” ·“Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).” al-Bukhaari (6682) and Muslim (2694) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Two words that are light on the tongue and heavy in the balance and beloved to the Most Merciful: Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).” ·The best of prayers for forgiveness (sayyid al-istighfaar): al-Bukhaari (6306) narrated from Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of prayers for forgiveness is to say: “The best prayer for seeking forgiveness is to say: ‘Allaahumma anta rabbi la ilaaha illa anta, Khalaqtani wa ana ‘abduka wa ana ‘ala ‘ahdika wa wa’dika ma astata’t. A’oodhu bika min sharri ma sana’tu, aboo’u laka bi ni’matika ‘alayya wa aboo’u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfiru’l-dhunoob illaa anta (O Allah, You are my Lord. None has the right to be worshipped but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You).’ Whoever says this during the day, having faith in it and dies before the evening comes, will be among the people of Paradise, and whoever says it during the night, having faith in it, and dies before the morning comes, will be among the people of Paradise.” Other kinds of dhikr, in general, are the adkhaar to be recited in the morning or the evening, those that are to be recited following the obligatory prayers and those that are to be recited before going to sleep, for the one who regularly recites them will have a great reward. Please see also the answer to question no 174947 Fourthly: It is prescribed for the Muslims to vary the adhkaar and all acts of worship. So sometimes he may read Qur’an, sometimes he may remember Allah (dhikr), sometimes he may pray, sometimes he may study books of knowledge, and sometimes he may relax by doing various kinds of permissible leisure activities. He should not limit himself to one specific type of worship, never doing anything else, because by doing that he will miss out on the reward and virtue of the other types of worship that he ignores, in addition to the fact that there is the fear that he may get tired and bored. Please see also the answer to question no. 195274 And Allah knows best."
151,What is the Role of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him)?,"Question I would like to know what the duties and functions of Jesus as ""Al-Masih"" in Islam are. Many Christian anti-Islamic sites have been asking this question. It’s not that my faith is not strong, but I could not explain my answer properly. Perhaps you can help me.","Praise be to Allah.‘Eesa (peace be upon him) has two roles: 1-His first role, which was before Allah raised him up to heaven when the Jews wanted to crucify him. His role at that time was, like that of any other Prophet, to convey the Message. Allah gave him the Injeel (Gospel) to confirm the Tawraat (Torah), and He gave him miracles which are well known, such as healing the blind and lepers, and raising the dead by Allah’s leave, and other well known miracles. “He called his people to worship Allah Alone and to believe in Him alone (Tawheed), and he was a witness against them throughout his stay among them.” 2-His second role will come at the end of time, when the Dajjaal (false messiah) will emerge. Allah will send ‘Eesa down to the earth, and he will be a leader of the believers who will rule them according to the Islamic sharee’ah (law). He will kill the Dajjaal, and the Mahdi (rightly guided leader) will appear during his time. Blessings will come down from Allah such that the milk of one camel will be sufficient for a large number of people, and wealth will be abundant. During his time Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj (Gog and Magog) will emerge and will spread mischief throughout the earth. “Allah will destroy them and ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) will rule the earth according to Islamic sharee’ah , until he dies and the Muslims offer the funeral prayer for him.” Then Allah will send a cool breeze which will take the soul of every believer, and after that none will be left except the most evil of people, upon whom the Hour will come."
152,"Their imam does not pray Maghrib in the mosque, so that he can eat iftar at home!",Question In our neighbourhood the imam does not pray Maghrib because he goes to break his fast. What is the ruling – are we sinning? Or should we pray Maghrib at home and will that count as prayer in congregation for us?.,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The Muslim must fear Allaah and offer the five daily prayers in congregation in the mosque, unless he is excused because of sleeping, sickness and so on. See question no. 8918. With regard to Maghrib prayer in Ramadaan in particular, there is a great of neglect concerning it among many worshippers. The imam should be at the head of the worshippers in this prayer for a reason other than the fact that he is obliged to pray in congregation; this reason is fulfilment of the trust to which he has been appointed, or the task with which he has been entrusted. If this imam neglects to pray Maghrib in congregation in the mosque, this does not mean that you are sinning or that it is permissible for you to pray at home; rather you must offer the prayer in congregation in the mosque, even if the imam is not present. Each person is accountable for his own deeds. Even if he does wrong, you are still obliged to do the right thing and avoid doing wrong, so as to preserve this ritual which is one of the pillars of Islam. It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Whoever would like to meet Allaah, may He be exalted, tomorrow as a Muslim, let him regularly offer these prayers where the call to prayer is given, for Allaah has prescribed the Sunnahs of guidance to your Prophet (S) and they (the prayers) are among the Sunnahs of guidance. If you pray in your houses like this one who stays away from the mosque prays in his house, you will have forsaken the Sunnah of your Prophet, and if you forsake the Sunnah of your Prophet you will go astray. There is no man who purifies himself and purifies himself well, then he goes to one of these mosques, but Allaah will record one good deed for him for every step he takes, and will raise him in status one degree thereby, and will erase one bad deed thereby. I remember when no one would stay away but a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known, and a man would come staggering between two others in order to stand in the row. Narrated by Muslim (654) Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is no concession allowing the one who is able to pray in congregation not to do so unless he has an excuse. Al-Umm (1/277). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Whoever studies the Sunnah properly will realize that offering the prayers in the mosque is an individual obligation unless there is an excuse which allows an individual to miss Jumu’ah prayer and prayer in congregation. Then Ibn al-Qayyim said: What we believe to be the correct view is that it is not permissible for anyone to stay away from praying in congregation in the mosque except one who is excused. Kitaab al-Salaah (p. 166) Thirdly: The way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the best of ways. He would break his fast with fresh dates; if none were available, with dry dates, and if he could not find any dates, he would break his fast with water, then he would go and pray Maghrib. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would break his fast with fresh dates before praying. If there were no fresh dates, he would eat a few dried dates. If there were no dried dates, he would drink a few sips of water. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (632); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. What this imam is doing is contrary to the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so you should advise him to come back to the right path. And Allaah knows best."
153,Ruling on immoral magazines,"Question What is the ruling on publishing magazines in which uncovered women appear in a tempting way and which deal with news of actors and actresses? What is the ruling on people who work for these magazines and help to distribute them, and on those who buy them?","Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to publish magazines that contain pictures of women or that propagate zinaa (unlawful sexual activity), immorality, homosexuality, drinking alcohol or other forms of falsehood. It is not permissible to work as an editor, writer or distributor for such magazines, because this involves co-operating in sin, spreading mischief throughout the land, calling for the corruption of society and propagating promiscuity. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… help one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily Allah is Severe in punishment.” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls to right guidance will have a reward equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his reward; and whoever calls to misguidance will bear sin equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his sin.” (Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 4831). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait and with their heads looking like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such-and-such a distance.” (Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 3971). There are many aayaat and ahaadeeth on this topic. We ask Allah to help the Muslims to do what is good for them."
154,Is Wudu Valid If Something Prevents Water from Reaching Your Feet?,"Question There are things stuck to my feet because my feet are very cracked, and I cannot remove them. Does this invalidate Wudu? On one occasion, tarmac got stuck to my feet and I removed some of it but I was not able to remove the rest. Is this prayer permissible? There is an app for mobile phones which gives the times for prayer and so on, but it has copyright. Is this permissible?","Praise be to Allah.Is Wudu valid if something prevents water from reaching your feet? It is obligatory to remove anything that may prevent water from reaching the skin , but one is forgiven for a very small amount such as dirt under the fingernails or in cracks in the feet, after trying hard to remove it. Al-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (1/158): “If there is a little dirt under the fingernails that prevents the water reaching under them, his purification is not valid. This was stated by Ibn `Aqil. … And it was also said that it is valid, and this is the correct view. This is the view to which the author (Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him)) was inclined, and it was the view favoured by Shaykh Taqi Ad-Din [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him). It was also said that it is valid on the part of one for whom it is difficult to avoid it, such as those who do handicrafts or hard work such as farming and so on. Shaykh Taqiy Ad-Deen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If there is something of such material anywhere on the body, such as blood, dough and the like, if it is a small amount, then it does not matter.” If it is not possible to remove what has got stuck to the skin and there is a great deal of it, such that it is not pardoned, in that case you should wipe over it, as in the case of a plaster cast. Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If there is some barrier that is preventing the water from reaching the skin, in that case you cannot say that the limb has been washed , but Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: A small amount is forgiven, especially for one who has that problem. This applies to workers who use paint, because they often have one or two spots that they have either forgotten or could not find any means of removing them at present. According to the opinion of Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him), they are pardoned for this. But we learn from the Hadith – which was narrated by Muslim (243) from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that a man did Wudu and omitted a place the size of a fingernail on his foot. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon) saw him and said: “Go back and do your Wudu properly ,” so he went back, then he prayed – we learn from this that something may not be forgiven even if it is small, if it is possible to remove it before the time for the prayer ends. In that case he should remove it, otherwise he should wipe over it and it becomes like a plaster cast ."" (Sharh Al-Kafi) Can we use copyrighted Apps? If the creator of a mobile app has not given permission to copy it, then it is not permissible to copy it . And Allah knows best."
155,"It is not permissible to eat meat that was slaughtered for anyone or anything other than Allah, even if the one who slaughtered it mentioned the name of Allah over it","Question There is meat that was slaughtered for a Buddhist person who bought it (the animal) in order to slaughter it because of a belief that they have which is contrary to our religion (according to their belief, to drive out evil spirits), but the one who slaughtered it was a Muslim and he slaughtered it in the Islamic way. Is it permissible to eat it?.","Praise be to Allah. If it was slaughtered purely for the meat, as is the basic reason for which people slaughter animals, then it must be done in the name of Allah. If the name of Allah was mentioned over it, it is permissible to eat it, if it was slaughtered in the well-known shar‘i manner. If the name of Allah was not mentioned over it, it is not permissible to eat it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So eat of that (meat) on which Allaah’s Name has been pronounced (while slaughtering the animal), if you are believers in His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). 119. And why should you not eat of that (meat) on which Allaah’s Name has been pronounced (at the time of slaughtering the animal), while He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity? And surely, many do lead (mankind) astray by their own desires through lack of knowledge. Certainly your Lord knows best the transgressors” [al-An‘aam 6:118-119] “Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allaah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and disobedience of Allaah). And certainly, the Shayaateen (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you, and if you obey them[by making Al‑Maytah (a dead animal) legal by eating it], then you would indeed be Mushrikoon (polytheists); [because they (devils and their friends) made lawful to you to eat that which Allaah has made unlawful to eat and you obeyed them by considering it lawful to eat, and by doing so you worshipped them; and to worship others besides Allaah is polytheism]” [al-An‘aam 6:121] But if what is intended by slaughtering it is an act of worship, then added to the above conditions is that this sacrifice should have been done for Allah, like all other acts of worship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). 163. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims’” [al-An‘aam 6:162-163]. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Here Allah is commanding him (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) to tell the mushrikeen who worship gods other than Allah and offer sacrifices that are not done in His name, that he differs from them in that; his prayer is for Allah, his sacrifice is in His name alone with no partner or associate. This is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only)” [al-Kawthar 108:2], i.e., make your prayer and sacrifice sincerely for Him alone. The mushrikeen used to worship idols and offer sacrifices to them, so Allah commanded him to be different from them and turn away from their path, and turn with a sincere intention and devotion to Allah alone. End quote. Tafseer Ibn Katheer (3/381-382) Muslim (1978) narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allaah curse the one who offers a sacrifice to anything other than Allaah.” Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by offering a sacrifice to anything other than Allah is that which is slaughtered in the name of anything or anyone other than Allah, such as a sacrifice offered to an idol or the cross or Moosa or ‘Eesa (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them both) or to the Ka‘bah and so on. All of that is haraam and this meat is not halaal, whether the one who slaughtered it is a Muslim or Christian or a Jew. That was stated by al-Shaafa‘i and agreed upon by our companions. If he also intended it as an act of veneration or worship of the one other than Allah to whom he slaughtered it, that is kufr. If the one who slaughtered it was a Muslim before that, he becomes an apostate because of this slaughter. End quote. The one who slaughters a sacrifice for anyone or anything other than Allah, such as one who slaughters it for an idol or to ward off evil spirits -- as they claim -- or to draw close to whatever he worships instead of Allah or to a “saint” (wali) and so on is a mushrik who is beyond the pale of Islam and it is not permissible to eat meat slaughtered by him, whether he mentioned the name of Allah over it or not, because he slaughtered it as a sacrifice to someone other than Allah, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:173]. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The apparent meaning of the words “and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah” is that whatever is slaughtered for anyone or anything other than Allah, such as if it is said, This is a sacrifice to such and such, and this is the intention, whether the person spoke it out loud or not, is haraam, and the prohibition in this case is clearer than the prohibition on that which was slaughtered by a Christian for meat over which he said the name of Christ and so on. That which we slaughter as an act of worship to draw close to Allah is pure and better than that which we slaughter for meat and mention the name of Allah over, because worshipping Allah by praying to Him and sacrificing to Him is better than seeking help by saying His name at the beginning of every action. By the same token, shirk that involves praying to anyone other than Allah and offering sacrifices to anyone other than Him is worse shirk than seeking help in the name of this other “god” at the beginning of every action. If that over which the name of Christ or al-Zahrah is mentioned is haraam, then that which is sacrificed to Christ or al-Zahrah or is intended as such is even more haraam. Based on that, if something is slaughtered for someone other than Allah as an act of worship to draw close to him, it is haraam, even if the name of Allah is mentioned over it, as some of the hypocrites of this ummah do, who seek to draw close to the “saints” (awliya’) and stars by offering sacrifices, burning incense and so on. If these people are apostates, then meat slaughtered by them is not permissible under any circumstances, because both reasons are combined in this case End quote from Iqtida’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 260 The scholars of the Standing Committee said: Offering a sacrifice to anyone or anything other than Allah is shirk, and the meat comes under the same rulings as maytah (dead meat), and it is not permissible to eat it even if the name of Allah is mentioned over it, if it is established that it was slaughtered for anyone or anything other than Allah. End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/226 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Offering a sacrifice to anyone or anything other than Allah is major shirk, because sacrifice is an act of worship, so the one who offers a sacrifice to anyone or anything other than Allah is a mushrik whose shirk puts him beyond the pale of Islam -- whether he sacrifices that to one of the Angels or one of the Messengers or one of the Prophets or one of the caliphs or one of the awliya’ (saints) or one of the scholars. All of that is associating others with Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and puts one beyond the pale of Islam. With regard to eating the meat of these sacrifices, it is haraam, because it was sacrificed to something or someone other than Allah, and everything that is sacrificed to something or someone other than Allah, or was sacrificed on a stone altar, is haraam. End quote. Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/148 If this Muslim slaughterman knew that this animal that he slaughtered was being slaughtered for someone or something other than Allah, even if he mentioned the name of Allah over it, this is major shirk as stated above. If he slaughtered it and did not know that, rather he was asked to slaughter it and he did so, thinking that they were slaughtering it for meat, then there is no blame on him. And Allah knows best. See also the answer to question number 44730."
156,Is it acceptable to slaughter the sacrificial animal in the case of Hajj tamattu‘ on the day of at-Tarwiyah?,"Question My friend’s parents went to perform the obligatory Hajj in the mid-1990s, and they did tamattu‘ with a group from our country Egypt. Then everyone who was in the group slaughtered the sacrificial animal on the day of at-Tarwiyah and ate from it on the day of at-Tarwiyah and the day of ‘Arafah. They did that on the basis of a fatwa given by the leader of the group, who told them that it came from Shaykh Jaad al-Haqq (may Allah have mercy on him). He also told them that this was how they slaughtered the sacrificial animals every year. Is their offering the sacrifice at that time acceptable, or do they have to offer a compensatory sacrifice? If they have to offer a compensatory sacrifice, do they have to pay the cost themselves when they are in Makkah (as it is possible for them to go for ‘Umrah next year or the following year), or can they appoint someone as their proxy among people they know in Makkah? Please advise us, may Allah reward you.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The fuqaha’ differed concerning the time when the sacrificial animal is to be slaughtered by those who are doing tamattu‘ (‘Umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between) and qiraan (‘umrah followed by Hajj, without exiting ihram in between). The majority are of the view that the time for offering the sacrifice begins on the Day of Sacrifice, and it is not valid if done before that. The Shaafa‘is are of the view that it is permissible to sacrifice it after entering ihram for Hajj, or after exiting ihram for ‘Umrah and before entering ihram for Hajj, according to the more correct opinion. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (3/247): With regard to the time for offering (the sacrifice), it is the Day of Sacrifice. This was the view of Maalik and Abu Haneefah, because before the Day of Sacrifice it is not permissible to slaughter the udhiyah (sacrifice), so by the same token it is not permissible to slaughter the hadiy (sacrificial animal) for Hajj tamattu ‘ during that time, as it is also not permissible before exiting ihram from ‘umrah. Ash-Shaafa‘i said: It is definitely permissible to slaughter it after entering ihram for Hajj. With regard to the time before that, after exiting ihram for ‘umrah, it may or may not be permissible. The reason why it may be permissible is that it is a sacrifice that is connected to ihram, and may be made up for by fasting. Therefore it is permissible to slaughter it before the Day of Sacrifice, like the compensatory sacrifice to be offered if one puts on perfume when in ihram or puts on tailored clothing. Because it is permissible to make it up before the Day of Sacrifice, it is also permissible to slaughter it before that day, like all other fidyahs. End quote. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: To sum up, there are three scholarly views concerning the time when it is permissible to do it: 1. After entering ihram for ‘umrah 2. After finishing ‘umrah – which is the most correct view 3. After entering ihram for Hajj. End quote from al-Majmoo‘ (7/184) The most correct view is that of the majority. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when discussing the conditions of the hadiy (sacrifice):… 4. It should be slaughtered at the proper time for slaughtering. Concerning that there is a difference of scholarly opinion, which we may sum up as follows: The first view is that the sacrifice of tamattu‘ should not be slaughtered except at the time when the udhiyah sacrifices are also slaughtered, which is the day of ‘Eid and the three days following ‘Eid. The second view is that it is permissible to bring forward the sacrifice after having entered ihram for ‘Umrah. So the hadiy may be slaughtered even before going out to Mina for Hajj, because it is permissible to fast – for the one who does not have a hadiy – before going out for Hajj even though it is making up for the sacrifice. So if that is permissible in the case of making up, then it is more apt to say that it is permissible in the case of the original action. This is the well-known view among the Shaafa‘is. The correct view is that it is stipulated that it should be done at the right time, and that the hadiy in the case of tamattu‘ can only be offered on the days when the sacrificial animals are to be slaughtered, namely the day of ‘Eid and the three days that follow it. The evidence for that is that if it was permissible to bring forward slaughter of the sacrificial animal before the day of Eid, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have done that, but he said: “I will not exit ihram until I offer the sacrifice.” And that is only permissible on the day of Eid. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (7/91). Secondly: If the pilgrim relied on a fatwa that permitted slaughtering the sacrificial animal on the day of at-Tarwiyah, then his sacrifice is acceptable and he does not have to do anything further. If a person has to offer a compensatory sacrifice, he may appoint a proxy to slaughter it on his behalf in Makkah, and he does not have to slaughter it himself or send the cost to Makkah. To sum up: your friend’s parents do not have to do anything further, and their sacrifice is acceptable, in sha Allah. And Allah knows best."
157,Seeking help from anyone other than Allaah is shirk,"Question I often hear people saying “Madad ya Rasool-Allaah, Madad ya Sayyidina al-Husayn, madad ya Sayyid yaa Badawi…” and I do not know the meaning of these words.","Praise be to Allah. It should be noted that Allaah has created the universe to worship Him and Him alone. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56] Allaah sent the Messengers to call their people to worship Allaah alone (Tawheed) and to forbid them to associate anything with Him (shirk). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): Laa ilaaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [al-Anbiya’ 21:25] Shirk means directing worship to anyone other than Allaah, and du’aa’ comes under the heading of worship which must be devoted to Allaah alone and not directed to anyone else. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ is worship.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2969; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. Asking for madad from anyone other than Allaah, as mentioned in the question, is a kind of calling upon (or making du’aa’ to) someone other than Allaah, hence it is a kind of shirk. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (2/193): The words of some of those who sing nasheed, “Madad ya sayyidina al-Husayn (Help O our master al-Husayn), madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab, madad ya Badawi ya Shaykh al-‘Arab, madad ya Rasool Allaah (O Messenger of Allaah), madad ya awliya’ Allaah (O close friends – or ‘saints’ – of Allaah),” etc, is major shirk which puts the one who says it beyond the pale of Islam (Allaah forbid), because it is calling upon the dead to give them good things, to help them, to ward off danger or relieve them of harm. That is because what is meant by madad is giving, help and support. So it as if the person who says, “Madad ya Sayyid ya Badawi, madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab” etc is saying: Help us and give us of your bounty, and relieve us of hardship and ward off calamity from us. This is major shirk. Allaah says, after explaining to His slaves that He is in control of the universe and that it is subjugated to Him: “Such is Allaah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything)” [Faatir 35:13-14 – interpretation of the meaning] So He calls their prayers to others shirk. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allaah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them? And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping” [al-Ahqaaf 46:6] So Allaah tells us that those who are called upon other than Him, the Prophets and the righteous, are unaware of the call of those who call upon them and will never respond to their calls, and they will be their enemies and will deny their worship of them. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Do they attribute as partners to Allaah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves. And if you call them to guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you call them or you keep silent. Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allaah are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful” [al-A’raaf 7:191-194] “And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allaah, any other ilaah (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, Al-Kaafiroon (the disbelievers in Allaah and in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful” [al-Mu’minoon 23:117] So Allaah tells us that whoever calls upon anyone other than Allaah, among the dead etc., will never succeed because of his kufr and his calling upon someone other than Allaah."
158,Is there a du’aa’ for moving into a new house?,"Question I HAVE SHIFTED INTO A NEW HOUSE. PLEASE COULD YOU SUPPLY ME WITH A DUAA FOR THE PROTECTION OF MY HOUSE, SINCE I AM GETTING MARRIED AND HAVE RE-LOCATED TO A NEW AREA.","Praise be to Allah.Is there a du’aa’ for moving into a new house? We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, who answered as follows: “Praise be to Allaah. When he enters a house or stops to camp in a spot out of doors, he should say, ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat-Illaah it-taammaati min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created)’ three times. If he says this, then nothing will harm him until he leaves that place.” The house he is talking about is a new house which he is going to go and live in for the first time. What should he say? “When he enters it for the first time, he should say, ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat-Illaah it-taammaati min sharri ma khalaq.’” Can he say, “Rabbi anzilni munzalan mubaarakan [My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place – al-Mu’mineen 23:29 – interpretation of the meaning]”? “This is for when one embarks on a boat or ship.” And Allaah knows best."
159,He wants to photograph his wife naked so that he can look at the pictures when he is away!,"Question Can a husband video tape his wife while she is naked or showing off her body parts, so he can watch the video when he is away or when she is not there, and get the pleassure that way for time being rather than watching something else which might be haram.","Praise be to Allah.The action mentioned in the question is one of the most abhorrent of actions. It is haraam in and of itself and because of what it leads to. As for it being haraam in and of itself: a woman in principle is entirely ‘awrah and it is not permissible to take her picture in the first place, even if nothing appears but her face and hands, so how about if what appears is more than that. What if the picture shows her most private ‘awrah? Undoubtedly this is more abhorrent and sinful and leads to greater punishment. The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: Is a picture of a woman in her passport or elsewhere ‘awrah or not? Is it acceptable for a woman, if she refuses to have her picture taken, to delegate someone to perform Hajj on her behalf, because she cannot get a passport for that reason? And what is the limit of covering for women according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah? They replied: She does not have the right to allow her face to be photographed, whether in a passport or otherwise, because it is ‘awrah, and because having her picture in a passport or elsewhere is a cause of people being tempted because of her. But if she cannot travel for Hajj without doing that, then she is granted a concession allowing her to have her picture taken so that she may perform the obligatory duty of Hajj, and it is not permissible for her to delegate someone else to do it on her behalf. The entire woman is ‘awrah according to the evidence of the Qur'aan and Sunnah, so what she is required to do is to cover all of her body before non-mahrams, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers …” [al-Noor 24:31] “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts” [al-Ahzaab 33:53] Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (1/718, 719). In the answer to question no. 13342 we quoted Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan as saying: Taking pictures of women is not permitted at all, because of the temptation and evil that results from that, in addition to the fact that taking pictures is forbidden in and of itself. So it is not permissible to take pictures of women when traveling or for any other reason. The Council of Senior Scholars has issued a statement that this is haraam. End quote. The husband has no excuse for taking pictures of his wife naked because he is her husband. That does not make it permissible for him to do this abhorrent act, and his being away from his wife is not regarded as an excuse for him, because it is haraam to take pictures of women in the first place – we have quoted fatwas of the scholars concerning that – and because of the evil consequences to which it leads. Among the consequences to which keeping pictures of one’s wife when she is naked or immodestly dressed may lead are the following: 1.The husband’s belongings may be stolen or he may lose or forget the picture in a public place, so the picture may be spread far and wide and it may fall into the hands of fools who would make use of the picture to cause more evil and corruption. 2.He and his wife may get divorced, in which case she would become a stranger (non-mahram) to him, in which case it would not be permissible for him to look at her after the divorce which makes her a stranger to him. 3.The husband may use it against his wife. There have been many such cases where the husband uses such things against his wife to make her give up her financial rights or fulfil his haraam desires or keep quiet about his abhorrent actions, and all of that happens because he possesses pictures or a video of her when she is naked or semi-naked. 4.The husband’s looking at a picture of his naked wife when he is away from her will never extinguish his desire, rather the opposite is the case. It will inflame his desires and they cannot be extinguished – in most cases – except by doing haraam actions such as the secret habit – which is the least of them – or zina or homosexuality – Allaah forbid. So his excuse for taking pictures of his wife and keeping them so he can look at them when he is away from her is unacceptable, and his action is a cause of him falling into haraam, because of the picture-taking itself, and because of the evils to which it leads. It is not permissible for the husband to take a picture of his wife when she is naked or semi-naked. He should have the attitude of protective jealousy for his honour, and do whatever he can to protect his honour and not neglect it by doing such actions. Similarly, it is not permissible for the wife to agree to do that and she should denounce him and not respond to him. Allaah has made each spouse a libaas (screen) for the other. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them) Tafsir] for you and you are the same for them” [al-Baqarah 2:187] The husband should pay attention to that: he is a screen for his wife, so how could he seek to uncover her by means of this action when the basic principle is that he should be a screen and conceal her? The husband should not stay away from his wife and family a great deal, because he needs them and they need him. His wife needs him so that they can keep one another chaste, and the children need him to raise them and look after them. If the husband has to go away and the wife agrees to that, then he must fear Allaah, his Lord, and keep away from anything that may provoke his desire such as mixing with women, being alone with a member of the opposite sex or looking. He should do a lot of acts of worship, especially fasting, and he should choose righteous companions who will guide him to do good and encourage him to obey Allaah. We ask Allaah to help him to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows best."
160,What is narrated in the Sunnah about the invasion of India,"Question I have a question about the invasion of India, and the claims made by some people that it will happen. They say that the one who is killed during that invasion will enter Paradise, and they quote as evidence this hadith: It was narrated by an-Nasaa’i (hadith no. 3124) that Thawbaan, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two groups of my ummah whom Allah will protect from the Fire: the group that invades India, and the group that will be with ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him).” In Sunan an-Nasaa’i (hadith no. 3123) it is also narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) promised us that we would invade India. If I live to see that, I will offer myself and my wealth in that campaign. If I am killed, I will be one of the best of the martyrs, and if I come back I will be Abu Hurayrah the liberated (from Hellfire).” First of all, are these hadiths saheeh? If they are, then do they really refer to a war in the subcontinent towards the end of the world?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: With regard to the first hadith, which is the hadith of Thawbaan, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it is a saheeh hadith. It was narrated by an-Nasaa’i in his Sunan (3175) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh an-Nasaa’i. It was also narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (37/81), and classed as hasan by the commentators. With regard to the second hadith, which is the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, it is a da‘eef (weak) hadith. It was narrated by an-Nasaa’i (3173) and classed as da‘eef by al-Albaani in Da‘eef an-Nasaa’i. it was also narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (12/28 – ar-Risaalah edition), and classed as da‘eef by the commentators. There are other isnaads for the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, all of which are da‘eef, and there are other hadiths on this topic that are not free of problems. What has been proven and established to be saheeh is the hadith of Thawbaan. Secondly: India was indeed invaded and taken over by the Muslims, and they destroyed its idols, on several occasions. That began at the time of al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik, under the leadership of al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad ath-Thaqafi. It was also invaded and taken over at the time of the ‘Abbasids, under the leadership of the commander Mahmoud ibn Sabuktigin (may Allah have mercy on him). He took it upon himself to invade India once every year. Shaykh Siddeeq Hasan Khan (d. 1307 AH – may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to India, it was conquered during the reign of al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik, at the hands of Muhammad ibn Qaasim ath-Thaqafi in 92 AH, and his banners reached from the borders of Sindh to Kannauj in 95 AH. After he returned, the rulers of India returned to their places and the rulers among the Marwanid and ‘Abbasid caliphs remained in Sindh. … The author of al-Mughni said: … At the end of the fourth century AH, Sultan Mahmoud al-Ghaznawi set out to invade India, and he came several times; he was victorious and he captured war booty, and he wrested Sindh from the governors of the ‘Abbasid caliph al-Qaadir Billah ibn al-Muqtadir. But Sultan Mahmoud did not stay in India. His sons controlled a region stretching from Ghazneen to Lahore until the Sultan Mu‘izz ad-Deen Saam al-Ghuri took over Ghazneen, and came to Lahore and captured Khusrau Malik, who was the last ruler the Ghaznawi dynasty. He seized control of India and made Delhi the seat of government in 589 AH. From that date until the end of the twelfth century, the kingdoms of India were in the hands of Muslim Sultans. Abjad al-‘Uloom (1/344-345). Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the events of the year 94 AH: In that year, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad ath-Thaqafi conquered India and captured booty that cannot be enumerated or described. Al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (9/113) Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the events of 96 AH: In that year, Yameen ad-Dawlah – Mahmoud ibn Sabuktigin – invaded India, conquering major cities and seizing a large amount of booty. He took captive one of their kings – namely the king of Karachi – who fled when he conquered it, and he broke their idols. Al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (11/358). He also (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the events of 149 AH: in that year, Mahmoud ibn Sabuktigin invaded India, and met the king of India in battle. There was a great deal of fighting among the people, then the fighting ended with a great defeat for India, and the Muslims killed many of them and captured a great deal of booty from them, including gemstones, gold and silver. They also took from them two hundred elephants and they tried to pursue those who fled the battlefield, and destroyed many temples. Al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (12/8) What happened of the invasion of India is one of the signs of Prophethood, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) foretold its happening. This was knowledge of the unseen that Allah revealed to him. Ustadh Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahhaab Buhayri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It should be noted: the hadith mentioned – i.e., the hadith of Thawbaan – is one of the signs of Prophethood. The Muslims invaded India and Sindh at the time of the Umayyads – then he mentioned some incidents that occurred during the invasion and conquest of India. Buloogh al-Amaani min Asraar al-Fath ar-Rabbaani (22/411) There is nothing to indicate that there will be another invasion of India that will occur at the end of time, close to the onset of the Hour or during the time of ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him), as was suggested by some scholars. Rather what appears to be the case is that what is referred to in the hadith is what actually happened. The hadith of Thawbaan does not mention the connection between the two groups; rather each group has its own time, although both of them may share the same virtue. And Allah knows best."
161,Can You Leave the Mosque During I’tikaf?,"Question I would like to know how i’tikaf is to be done in the mosque during the last ten days of Ramadan, noting that I work and my work finishes at 2 p.m. Do I have to stay in the mosque all the time?","Praise be to Allah.When can you leave the mosque during i’tikaf? If the mu`takif (person observing itikaf) goes out of the mosque, his i’tikaf is invalidated, because i’tikaf means staying in the mosque to worship Allah. That applies unless the mu`takif goes out for an unavoidable reason, such as to relieve himself, to do wudu or ghusl, or to bring food if he does not have anyone to bring food to the mosque for him, and other similar matters which cannot be avoided and which cannot be done in the mosque. Al-Bukhari (2092) and Muslim (297) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used not to enter the house except for things that a person needs when he was observing i’tikaf . Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (4/466): “What is meant by things that a person needs is to urinate and defecate, because every person needs to do that. Similarly, he also needs to eat and drink. If he does not have anyone who can bring him food and drink, then he may go out to get them if he needs to. For everything that he cannot do without and cannot do in the mosque, he may go out for that purpose, and that does not invalidate his i’tikaf, so long as he does not take a long time doing it.” Can you go to work during i’tikaf? If the mu`takif goes out to do his work, this is something that invalidates i’tikaf . The Standing Committee was asked: Is it permissible for the mu`takif to visit someone who is sick or to accept an invitation or to attend to his family’s needs or to attend a funeral or to go to work? They replied: “The Sunnah is that the mu`takif should not visit one who is sick during his i’tikaf , or accept any invitation, or attend to his family’s needs, or attend any funeral, or go to work outside the mosque, because it was proven that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Sunnah is for the mu`takif not to visit any sick person, or attend any funeral, or touch his wife or be intimate with her, or to go out for any purpose except those which cannot be avoided.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2473) (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/410) For more, please see this category: I’tikaf. And Allah knows best."
162,Response to a dubious question about where Allah is if the angels are carrying the Throne,"Question This provocative question was asked by some apostates around us who have left the faith: where will Allah be when the eight angels carry His Throne, as it says in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And there will bear the Throne of your Lord above them, that Day, eight [of them]” [al-Haaqqah 69:17].","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: What is indicated by many texts is that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is above all of His creation, for He is the Most High, Most Exalted, may He be blessed and sanctified. The Throne is the roof of all creation and Allah, may He be exalted, is above the Throne, risen above it, as He tells us in seven places in His Book. The word istiwaa’ (referring to His having risen above the Throne) is known from a linguistic point of view, how is not known, and believing in it is obligatory, as was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him). See also the answers to questions no. 992 and 219403. Secondly: Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that His Throne is great, and that it has bearers who carry it. There is a hadith which describes their huge size. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Those [angels] who carry the Throne and those around it exalt [ Allah ] with praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who have believed, [saying], ""Our Lord, You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who have repented and followed Your way and protect them from the punishment of Hellfire” [Ghaafir 40:9]. Abu Daawood (4727) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given permission to speak of one of the angels of Allah, one of the bearers of the Throne. The distance between his earlobe and his shoulder is like the distance of seven hundred year’s travel.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Daawood. Thirdly: The Throne has bearers who are carrying it now and will carry it on the Day of Resurrection, as indicated by the verse quoted above, and as mentioned in the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “… but when our Lord, may His name be blessed and exalted, decrees some matter, the bearers of the Throne glorify Him, then the inhabitants of heaven who are closest to them glorify Him, until the tasbeeh (glorification) reaches the inhabitants of this lowest heaven. Then those who are nearest to the bearers of the Throne say: What did your Lord say? And they tell them what He said…” Narrated by Muslim (2229). But it is narrated that the bearers of the Throne now are four, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be eight; it was said that they will be eight angels, or they will be eight rows of angels. The view that the bearers of the Throne now are four is the view of the majority of mufassireen; this view was thought most likely to be correct by a number of scholars, including Ibn Katheer. Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It says in the hadith that today they are four, and on the Day of Resurrection Allah will send four more angels to support them. This is the view of the majority. End quote from Zaad al-Maseer (4/331). See: Tafseer Ibn Katheer (7/130). The hadith referred to is what was narrated by at-Tabari with his isnad from ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam who said: The Messenger of Allah ( blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Today it is carried by four and on the Day of Resurrection it will be carried by eight.” This is a da‘eef (weak) hadith, because its isnad (chain of narrators) is interrupted. At-Tabari also narrated with his isnad from Ibn Ishaaq who said: It was narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Today they – meaning the bearers of the Throne – are four, and on the Day of Resurrection Allah will support them with four others, so they will be eight.” See Tafseer at-Tabari (29/59). The soundest evidence to support that is what was narrated by Ahmad (2314), ad-Daarimi in his Sunan (2745), and al-Bayhaqi in al-Asmaa’ wa’s-Sifaat (771) from Ibn ‘Abbaas, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) confirmed something that Umayyah said in his poetry. He said: “A man and a bull under its (the Throne’s) right foot, and an eagle under the other foot, and a lion lying in wait.” The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He has spoken the truth.” This hadith was classed as saheeh by Ibn Katheer, and by Ahmad Shaakir in Tahqeeq al-Musnad. Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (7/130): This is a jayyid (good) isnad. It implies that the bearers of the Throne today are four, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be eight, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And there will bear the Throne of your Lord above them, that Day, eight [of them]” [al-Haaqqah 69:17]. End quote. It says in al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (1/21): This is a hadith with a saheeh isnad; its men are thiqaat (trustworthy). It indicates that the bearers of the Throne today are four. End quote. Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The only one who narrated this hadith was Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Yasaar with this isnad. What is meant by it is narrated in another hadith from Ibn ‘Abbaas, according to which the Kursiy is carried by four angels, an angel in the form of a man, an angel in the form of a lion, an angel in the form of a bull, and an angel in the form of an eagle. End quote from al-Asmaa’ wa’s-Sifaat by al-Bayhaqi (2/206). The editor and annotater, Shaykh ‘Abdullah al-Haashidi, classed the hadith as saheeh, and discussed its isnaads (chains of narration). Fourthly: With regard to the answer to the question: where will Allah be when the (eight) angels carry His Throne? The answer is: That Allah, may He be exalted, is above His Throne, and His Throne is above all of His creation; the Throne and its bearers are created beings, and Allah has no need of the Throne and has no need of its bearers, for He is the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence, the maintainer of all things, and everything is sustained by Him. The angels only carry His Throne by His power, may He be glorified, for it is He Who gave them the power to do that. Imam ad-Daarimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah is mightier than all things and greater than every created thing. The Throne did not have the power or strength to bear Him, and the bearers of the Throne do not have the power in themselves to carry it, and they are not able to carry His Throne because of what they possess of strength and power; rather they carry it by His power, His will and His support. Were it not for that, they would not have been able to carry it. It has been narrated to us that when they carried the Throne, above which is the Almighty in His glory and majesty, they were too weak to carry it, and they felt humbled and fell to their knees, until they were prompted to say “Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah),” then they were enabled to carry it by the power and will of Allah. Were it not for that, the Throne would not be able to bear Him, and neither would its bearers, the heavens and the earth and all those who are in them. End quote from Naqd Bishr al-Mareesi (1/457). In conclusion, the answer to this dubious question is that Allah, may He be exalted, is the Lord, the Sovereign, the Almighty Who does whatever He will. It was His will, may He be glorified, to rise above His Throne, and it was His will that His Throne should have bearers now and on the Day of Resurrection; it is He, may He be glorified, Who enabled them to carry this mighty Throne and enabled them to do that by His might and power. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The explanation is that is as follows: Allah has no need of anyone else, for He is the Creator of every created thing, and He did not become above His creation by means of some of the things that He created. Rather He, may He be glorified, created all created things and He, by His Essence, is above them and has no need of any of them to be exalted, as created beings need something to help them to be lifted up. Allah, may He be glorified, is the One Who carries, by His might and power, the Throne and the bearers of the Throne. According to one report, when Allah created the Throne, He commanded the angels to carry it. They said: How can we carry Your Throne, when Your Majesty is above it? He said: Say: Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah). So they are only able to carry the Throne by His might; when Allah puts strength into a created being, that created being becomes able to carry what Allah wills that he should carry of His greatness and so on. So by His might and power, it is He Who carries both the bearer and what the bearer carries. So how could He be in need of anything? End quote from Dar’ al-Ta‘aarud (7/19). Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated two views concerning the bearers of the throne and what they are carrying. In al-Maqaalaat (p. 211), he said: The scholars differed concerning the bearers of the Throne and what they carry. Some said that the bearers are carrying the Creator, and when He becomes angry, the Throne becomes heavier on their shoulders, and when He is pleased, it becomes lighter, and thus they are able to distinguish between His wrath and His pleasure. And the Throne makes a sound when it becomes heavy, like the creaking of a saddle. And some of them said that the Creator does not become heavier or lighter, and that the bearers do not carry Him; rather it is the Throne that becomes lighter or heavier, and is carried by the bearers. End quote. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bayaan Talbees al-Jahamiyyah (3/238): There are two views concerning the bearers of the Throne. The first view is that the bearers of the Throne carry the Throne, but they do not carry the One Who is above it. The second view is that they carry the Throne and the One Who is above it, as mentioned above. Then he mentioned the argument of both parties. The argument of the first party is: we do not accept that those who carry the Throne must necessarily be carrying the One Who is above it. The reason being that the one who carries the roof is not necessarily carrying what is above the roof, unless that which is above the roof is actually resting on it, because air, birds and so on are above the roof, but they are not carried by other things that the roof may be carrying. Similarly, the heavens are above the earth, but the earth is not carrying the heavens. Moreover, each heaven has another heaven above it, and the lower is not carrying the upper. If it is the case with regard to created things that a thing does not necessarily carry what is above it – rather that may or may not be the case – then the Throne is not necessarily carrying the Lord, may He be exalted, unless there is evidence to prove that. If the Throne is not carrying the Lord [for He is above the Throne], then it is more appropriate to say that the bearers are not carrying that which is above it. The argument of the second party is that we do not accept the notion that if the Throne and its bearers are carrying Allah, that must mean that Allah needs them. For it is Allah Who created them and created their strength and their deeds, so they only carry Him by His might and help, which is applicable to all of their deeds. So in reality, no one carries His essence except Him. Similarly, if His slaves call upon Him and He responds to them, and it is He, may He be glorified, Who created them and created their supplication and their deeds, then He is the One Who responds to what He created and helps them with what they do of deeds. End quote. Thus it becomes clear that there is no problem with the idea that the angels are carrying the Throne now and will do so on the Day of Resurrection. Allah, may He be glorified, is above His Throne and distinct from His creation, and He has no need of the Throne or its bearers. “And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him” [al-Qasas 28:68] “He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned” [al-Anbiyaa’ 21:23]. For more information, please see the answer to question no. 12290. We ask Allah to guide us and you, and make us steadfast. And Allah knows best."
163,"Response to those who say: I refer directly to the Qur’an and Sunnah, with no need for scholars","Question How should I respond to what some of my relatives say? When I tell them about the views of the scholars which explain to them that some of the things they do are haram, with evidence, they say: We learn our religion directly from the Qur’an and Sunnah, with no need for the scholars, because everyone can understand the Qur’an and Sunnah however he wishes, but these scholars are male and issue fatwas to suit the whims of men, and that undermine the rights of women. One time I even heard them saying words harshly criticising one of the scholars of Ahl as-Sunnah – Allah forbid.","Praise be to Allah.The ordinary Muslim cannot derive rulings himself from the Qur’an and Sunnah, because he is not qualified to do that. That is because deriving rulings requires knowledge of what constitutes evidence and how rulings are to be derived from it. This requires knowledge of issues on which there is consensus; what abrogates and what is abrogated (an-nasikh wa’l-mansukh); what is general and what is specific; what the text says and what the intended meaning is; what is sound (sahih) and what is weak (da‘if); how to work out what is more likely to be correct when there is an apparent conflict in the religious texts; when a command means that something is obligatory and when it means that something is recommended; and when a prohibition means that something is forbidden (haram) and when it means that it is disliked (makruh). How can the ordinary Muslim know this? Indeed it is beyond the ability of many seekers of knowledge. If this matter was something that is possible for everyone, Allah, may He be exalted, would not have said (interpretation of the meaning): {So ask the people of knowledge if you do not know} [an-Nahl 16:43]. People fall into two categories: those who have knowledge, whose role is to examine the texts and derive rulings from them; and ordinary people who follow the scholars and have no choice except to ask those who have knowledge. Imam Ahmad (3056) and Abu Dawud (337) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: A man sustained an injury at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then he had a wet dream, so he was instructed to do ghusl, so he did ghusl and died as a result. News of that reached the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: “They killed him, may Allah kill them! Isn’t the remedy for one who does not know to ask?” They applied the apparent meaning of the religious text, which is that one who has a wet dream must do ghusl, and they did not act upon the concession, the evidence for which may be derived from other religious texts. One who is not qualified may base his conclusion on a verse when the ruling based on that verse has been abrogated, or is specific or restricted to certain situations. Or he may quote a hadith that turns out to be da‘if (weak), or there is scholarly consensus that it is not to be acted upon, or it is specific or restricted to certain situations. The Companions, who had greater knowledge than anyone else, were not all qualified to derive rulings directly from the religious texts. Hence they would refer to the scholars among them, such as Mu‘adh, Ibn Mas‘ud, Ibn ‘Abbas and Ibn ‘Umar. From that developed the schools of jurisprudence, from which in turn the four madhhabs and others evolved. If the ordinary people were able to learn how to do ghusl and wudu’ properly and pray properly, without referring to the scholars, they would have attained a high level of achievement, but that is not possible at all for them. Perhaps one woman has a question about menses so she goes around to many seekers of knowledge but is unable to find an answer to her question, so how about if she wants to work out the ruling by herself? Islamic knowledge, like all other specialties, requires one to study and become qualified, and it cannot be learned from popular culture or superficial thinking. To make these people understand, several things are required: 1. You should give them a surah from the Qur’an and several hadiths [that speak of rulings] and test their understanding of the texts, so that they will realise that they need to read books which explain these texts. This understanding of the texts is several degrees lower than the level of deriving rulings, because deriving rulings requires knowledge of what we have discussed above, namely usul al-fiqh. 2. You should give them one of the books of tafsir and one of the commentaries on hadith, so they will realise how much effort and study is required to understand these commentaries, let alone derive rulings from the texts. 3. You should explain to them and make them understand that they are slaves of Allah and they should accept and comply with the rulings of Islam. They should understand that Allah is just and never wrongs any of His creation, and that He has prescribed for His slaves what is good for them, for He has the best knowledge of them. Once that is instilled in their hearts, all their doubts will be dispelled. For we do not have any such thing as fiqh that is pro-men and fiqh that is pro-women; no respectable scholar would be biased towards men in his verdicts or undermine the rights of women, who are his mother, his daughter, his sister and his wife! 4. You should list the issues to which these women are objecting and seek out evidence for them in the Qur’an, Sunnah, scholarly consensus and the views of the Companions, so as to dispel any doubts from their minds and so that it will become clear that the scholars did not go beyond what is mentioned in the texts and did not state any view to appease the wrongdoers or that is in accordance with whims and desires. You can make a list of these issues and ask scholars about the evidence regarding them, one by one. If these women trust the religious texts and accept them, and they do not trust the understanding of the scholars, you should present them with the religious texts that contain evidence, to see whether they accept them or not. We ask Allah to guide your relatives and bring them back to Him. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 386457 and 198487 . And Allah knows best."
164,He has two wives and he does not allow one of them go out or to receive visits from her family except with his permission,Question Is permissable for a man who has two wives to request from the first one to seek his permission everytime she leaves the house and when someone is coming to the house even if it were one of her family member and not request it from the second wife?.,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: One of the rights that the husband has over his wife is that she should not go out of his house except with his permission or let anyone into his house except with his permission. The evidence for the former is the report narrated in al-Saheehayn about the slander incident (al-ifk), in which ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Will you give me permission to go to my parents?” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4141; Muslim, 2770. Al-Iraqi said in Tarh al-Tathreeb (8/58): Her saying, “Will you give me permission to go to my parents?” indicates that the wife should not go to her parents’ house except with the permission of her husband. End quote. See also question no. 87834 The evidence for the latter is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “No woman should fast when her husband is present without his permission, and she should not allow anyone to enter his house when he is present without his permission.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4899; Muslim, 1026. The correct view is that the husband does not have the right to prevent his wife’s parents from visiting her unless he thinks it most likely that their visit will result in trouble and harm. See question no. 112048. Secondly: It is not obligatory to treat co-wives the same with regard to what is mentioned above. In the case of one of them going out of his house without his permission there may be the possibility of harm or trouble or temptation, or he may be very protectively jealous for her, or there may be other reasons that make the man resort to such a thing, so he makes her ask permission before going out, but he does not require that of the other wife. The same may be said concerning the issue of visits. What matters is that the husband should not seek thereby to harm his wife or hurt her and make things difficult for her, because that is contrary to the good treatment that he is enjoined to give her. And Allah knows best."
165,Children wearing short clothes,"Question Some women – may Allaah guide them – dress their young daughters in short clothes which show the calves. When we advise these mothers, they say, “We used to dress like this and it did not affect us when we grew up.” What do you think about this?","Praise be to Allah.I think that a person should not let his or her daughter wear such clothes when she is little, because if she gets used to wearing such clothes when she is little, she will continue to do so when she gets older, and it will not be such a big issue for her. But if she gets used to dressing modestly from a young age, she will continue to dress modestly when she gets older. What I advise our Muslim sisters to do is to shun the clothing of foreigners who are the enemies of our religion and to get their daughters used to wearing covering clothes and to the idea that modesty is part of religion."
166,The meeqaat for ‘Umrah for those who live in Jeddah,"Question I live in Jeddah where I am a student in the university, and I am married. My family (my father and mother) live in Makkah and I am going to go to Makkah to visit them and stay with them until Saturday. Is it permissible for my wife and I to enter Ihraam for ‘Umrah on Saturday from Ja’raanah, because it is close to my family’s home in al-Sharaa’i’?.","Praise be to Allah.If you have resolved to perform ‘Umrah on this trip of yours, then you have to enter Ihraam for it from Jeddah, because Jeddah is closer to Makkah and is closer than the meeqaat. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, after mentioning the meeqaats: “Whoever is closer than that should enter ihraam from his home and the people of Makkah should enter ihraam from there.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1526. According to another hadeeth: “Whoever is closer than that should enter ihraam from which he intends to head towards Makkah; and the people of Makkah should enter ihraam from Makkah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1524 Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Jeddah is the meeqat for its people and for those who live there. Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 17/34 In Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah it says: With regard to Jeddah, it is the meeqaat for the people of Jeddah and for those who live there, if they want to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah. And Allaah knows best."
167,What is the ruling on admitting a man or woman to the marital bedroom?,Question I wanted to check can a newly wedded couple or even normal husband and wife allow some one else to use their room or bed for sleeping purpose? ex: my Mother in law uses my bedroom in my absence for sleeping purpose. i came to know from sources that it creates differences between the husband and wife please help as this is back of my mind every day and i am facing a few minor issues with my husband because of my mother in law so its disturbing me even more.,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: One of the things concerning which there can be no doubt is that the marital bedroom is particularly private; it is the wife’s chamber and private space, the innermost part of her house, where she takes off her clothes and is alone with her husband, which is something that she cannot do anywhere except in this place. What makes this place even more private is that it is where she keeps her private clothes, cosmetics and adornments, and things that have to do with intimacy between husband and wife, which no one else should see, as they are regarded as being among the most private aspects of the marital relationship. What we have mentioned is the basic principle, and no one should go against it, but there may be specific circumstances which dictate allowing a relative to enter this private space, either because the house is small, or because they need to use the room for one of the women to sleep in, because it is more private than other parts of the house, or for some other reason, but that permission is subject to certain conditions: 1.That there should be a real need for that 2.That the underwear of the couple should not be visible, or anything else that may cause embarrassment if it is seen 3.That the person to whom permission is given to enter should be trustworthy, lest he mess about with private things in the room or tell others about it 4.That the husband should give permission for this person to enter. If he refuses then that should be heeded and one should not go against that. Similarly, the husband should not allow anyone to enter his wife’s bedroom if she dislikes that, unless it cannot be avoided, and the one who enters should be trustworthy, such as his mother or sister and so on, and he should ask his wife for permission and put her mind at rest. Whatever the case, the conditions that we have mentioned here are subject to ijtihaad, and the purpose of them is to protect the privacy of the family members, with particular attention to the marital relationship, and protect it from being messed about with or from breaches of confidentiality and disclosure of secrets. Muslim (1218) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allaah, and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the word of Allaah. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to sit on your furniture. If they do that, then hit them, but in a manner that does not cause injury or leave a mark.” Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained their rights and duties, and said: “Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to sit on your furniture” meaning, they should not allow anyone to enter upon them where they sleep or elsewhere, if you dislike people sitting on the furniture in your house. It is as if – and Allaah knows best – he was coining a similitude, meaning that they should not honour anyone whom you dislike. This is going against you by honouring one whom you dislike, by allowing him to sit on the furniture, or offering food to them, and so on. End quote. Sharh Riyaadh al-Saaliheen (3/126) Secondly: With regard to believing that if someone sleeps in the marital bed that will cause problems between the couple, this is a jaahili (ignorant) belief and a myth that the Muslim should be above accepting because of his belief in Tawheed. There is nothing in Islam that supports this idea, and there is nothing in real life that confirms it. Thirdly: With regard to your problems with your husband and his mother, this matter needs to be dealt with wisely and properly by you. Seek to earn your husband’s pleasure by being kind towards his mother, and seek to earn his mother’s love by dealing with her kindly, giving her gifts, and speaking nicely to her, because a kind word and good treatment win hearts. Seek reward from Allaah for putting up with annoyance from your husband’s mother and seek to please your husband; perhaps Allaah will create love and compassion between you and her. Seek the help of Allaah to fulfil your husband’s rights and to be patient in putting up with difficulties, and expect ease after hardship, and relief after difficulty. For reasons why the husband’s mother may not like the wife, and ways of dealing with the problems that result from that, please see the answer to question no. 84036. And Allaah knows best."
168,The one who is doing Hajj qiraan has to do one tawaaf and one saa‘i,"Question I went for Hajj with the intention of doing Qiraan. I finished ‘Umrah, then some of the brothers advised me to do saa‘i only once. Is that permissible? If not, what is the ruling?.","Praise be to Allah.The one who is doing Qiraan, i.e., combining Hajj and ‘Umrah, only has to do one tawaaf and one saa‘i, like the one who is doing Ifraad (Hajj only). The tawaaf that is obligatory in his case is tawaaf al-ifaadah. With regard to tawaaf al-qudoom, it is Sunnah. In his case, saa‘i may be done after tawaaf al-qudoom, or he may delay it and do it after tawaaf al-ifaadah. This is what is indicated by the saheeh Sunnah and is the view of most of the scholars. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The well known view narrated from Ahmad is that the one who is doing qiraan, i.e., combining Hajj and ‘Umrah, does not have to any actions but those that are required of the one who is doing ifraad (Hajj only), and one tawaaf and one saa‘i are acceptable in his case, for both his Hajj and his ‘Umrah. This is the view of Ibn ‘Umar and Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah, and was also suggested by ‘Ata’, Tawoos, Mujaahid, Maalik, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ishaaq, Abu Thawr and Ibn al-Mundhir. Another report was narrated from Ahmad, which suggests that he has to do two tawaafs and two saa‘is. This was the view of ath-Thawri and Abu Haneefah, and was also narrated from ‘Ali, but the report from him is not saheeh. Then he quoted the evidence of the majority and said: It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: As for those who combined Hajj and ‘Umrah, rather they only did one tawaaf for both. Agreed upon. In Muslim it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah, when she did Hajj and ‘Umrah together (qiraan): Your tawaaf is enough for your Hajj and ‘Umrah.” It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever enters ihram for Hajj and ‘Umrah (combined), one tawaaf and one saa‘i is sufficient for both.” It was narrated from Jaabir that the Prophet (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) combined Hajj and ‘Umrah (qiraan) and did one tawaaf for both. These two reports were narrated by at-Tirmidhi, who said concerning each of them: a hasan hadeeth. Ibn Maajah narrated from Jaabir, Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Messenger of Allah (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions only did one tawaaf for their ‘Umrah and Hajj. End quote from al-Mughni, 3/241 Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The majority of scholars who differentiate between qiraan and tamattu‘ say that for the one who is doing qiraan, one tawaaf is sufficient for both his Hajj and ‘Umrah, and that is tawaaf al-ifaadah, and one saa‘i. They quoted as evidence saheeh hadeeths, which cannot be matched by those who differ from them.""(Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 4/430 ) Thus it becomes clear that what you were told about the one who is doing qiraan of having to do one saa‘i is the correct view. It is quite clear that when the one who is doing qiraan has done tawaaf upon arrival (tawaaf al-qudoom) and saa‘i, he then remains in his ihram and does not remove any of his hair and does not call what he has done ‘Umrah; rather it is part of the actions of Hajj and ‘Umrah combined. And Allah knows best."
169,Reciting Qur’aan over water for ruqyah and heating it because the weather is cold,"Question I am a young Muslim man who has been affected by some kind of sihr (witchcraft). With regard to ruqyah by reciting Qur’aan, can I recite the Qur’aanic verses myself over the water? Do I have to remove all my clothes when doing ghusl? And finally, is it permissible to heat the water because the weather is cold?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: We ask Allaah to heal you, make you well and divert away from you that which you are experiencing. Secondly: It is permissible for you to recite Qur’aan over water and to drink some of it and wash yourself with it. This has been discussed and what should be recited to cure spells has been mentioned in the answer to question no. 12918. With regard to what you mention about reading for yourself over water; in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5735) and Saheeh Muslim (2192) it is narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) blew over himself and recited al-Mi’wadhatayn during his final sickness. When his pain got worse, I would recite over him and wipe his hand over him, seeking its blessing. Mu’ammar said: I asked al-Zuhri how he used to blow over himself. He said: He used to blow into his hands then wipe them over his face. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The words “in his final sickness” do not mean it is limited to that, rather ‘Aa’ishah indicated that this happened at the end of his life and that it was not abrogated. End quote. Thirdly: It is not essential to remove all one’s clothes when doing ghusl, whether it is ghusl for ruqyah or to cleanse oneself from janaabah and so on. What matters is that the water should reach the skin. ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) would do ghusl without taking off his clothes, because of his deep modesty (may Allaah be pleased with him). Narrated by Ahmad (543) with a hasan isnaad. In Kitaab al-Ghusl of his Saheeh, Imam al-Bukhaari included a chapter entitled: One who does ghusl naked when he is alone and in seclusion, but whoever can cover himself, covering is better. Bahz ibn Hakeem narrated from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that Allaah is more deserving that we be modest before Him than other people. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: When he said it is better, this means that it is permissible to wash oneself when naked, and this is the view of the majority of scholars. End quote. There is nothing wrong with heating the water and reciting over it. And Allaah knows best."
170,The hadeeth about the eclipse of the sun and moon when the Mahdi emerges is not saheeh,"Question I used to belong to the Ahmadi sect but praise be to Allaah, Allaah has guided me to the Sunnah, myself, my mother and two of my brothers. I ask Allaah to guide my father and all my brothers and sisters. I have read a hadeeth which says that one of the signs of the Mahdi will be that the sun and moon will be eclipsed in the month of Ramadaan, when he first appears. Is this hadeeth saheeh (sound) or da’eef (weak)?.","Praise be to Allah.We praise Allaah for having guided you and saved you from the danger of this deviant sect, and we ask Him to bless your father and all your family with right guidance. With regard to the report that you refer to, this is not a hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather it was narrated by al-Daaraqutni in his Sunan (2/65) from the words of Muhammad ibn al-Haneefiyyah (the son of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib). Al-Daaraqutni said: Abu Sa’eed al-Astakhri told us, Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Nawfal told us, ‘Ubayd ibn Ya’eesh told us, Yoonus ibn Bakeer told us, from ‘Amr ibn Shamr, from Jaabir, from Muhammad ibn ‘Ali who said: “Our Mahdi will have two signs, which have never appeared since the heavens and earth were created. The moon will be eclipsed on the first night of Ramadaan and the sun will be eclipsed halfway through, and this has never happened since Allaah created the heavens and the earth.” This report is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and is falsely attributed to Muhammad ibn ‘Ali (ibn al-Haneefiyyah), may Allaah have mercy on him. Dr. ‘Abd al-‘Aleem ‘Abd al-‘Azeem al-Bastawi said in his book al-Mawsoo’ah fi Ahaadeeth al-Mahdi al-Da’eefah wa’l-Mawdoo’ah, p. 169: “Its isnaad includes Yoonus ibn Bakeer ibn Waasil al-Shaybaani, Abu Bakr al-Jammaal al-Kufi (d. 199 AH), who makes mistakes; and ‘Amr ibn Shamr al-Ja’fi al-Kufi, the Shi’i Abu ‘Abd-Allaah, who is a fabricator of reports. Al-Sulaymaani said: ‘Amr used to fabricate ahaadeeth to support the Raafidis (Shi’is). Al-Jawzjaani said: He is a liar and deviant. Al-Haakim said: There were many fabricated reports from Jaabir al-Ja’fi, and no one narrated these false and fabricated reports from Jaabir except him. Ibn Hibbaan said: He is a Raafidi (Shi’i) who used to defame the Sahaabah and narrate fabricated reports from trustworthy narrators. Abu Haatim said: His hadeeth is munkar and da’eef, and should be ignored; they [the scholars] ignored him. He was described in such negative terms by more than one of the scholars, including al-Bukhaari, al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Sa’d, al-Daaraqutni and others. Jaabir is al-Ja’fi, who is matrook al-hadeeth. Shu’bah, Wakee’ and al-Thawri described him as trustworthy, but Ibn Ma’een, Abu Haneefah, Layth ibn Abi Sulaym, al-Jawzjaani, Ibn ‘Uyaynah, Ibn Kharraash, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr and others described him as a liar, and many described him as da’eef (weak). Al-Dhahabi said: Only Shu’bah described him as trustworthy so he was at odds with other scholars, and the scholars of hadeeth ignored his narrations. Ibn Hajar said: he is da’eef (weak) and a Raafidi (Shi’i). In conclusion: this report is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and the problem in its isnaad is ‘Amr al-Ja’fi. Al-‘Azeemabaadi said: ‘Amr ibn Shamr from Jaabir: both of them are da’eef (weak) and cannot be quoted as evidence.” And Allaah knows best."
171,Should the imam and the congregation raise their hands when he says the du’aa’ during the Friday khutbah?,"Question When the imam says du’aa’ during the khutbah on Friday, should he raise his hands or not? Should the congregation raise their hands or not?.","Praise be to Allah. When the khateeb says du’aa’ on Friday when he is on the minbar, the Sunnah is for him not to raise his hands when saying du’aa’, and the members of the congregation should not raise their hands either, rather it is sufficient for the imam to point with his forefinger, as is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Some of the Sahaabah criticized those who raised their hands when du’aa’ was said in the khutbah, because that was not the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Muslim (874) narrated from ‘Umaarah ibn Ru’aybah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he saw Bishr ibn Marwaan on the minbar, raising his hands, and he said: How ugly are these two hands. I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) doing no more than this with his hand, and he pointed with his index finger. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: This shows that the Sunnah is not to raise the hands during the khutbah, and this is the view of Maalik, our companions and others. Al-Qaadi narrated that some of the salaf and some of the Maalikis allowed it because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) raised his hands in the Friday khutbah when he prayed for rain. But the earlier scholars responded by saying that this raising of the hands was for a reason. End quote. If the imam prays for rain during the Friday khutbah, then it is Sunnah for him to raise his hands, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the members of the congregation should also raise their hands and say Ameen to his du’aa’, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (933) and Muslim (897) from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The people were stricken with a drought and famine at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was delivering the khutbah one Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said: O Messenger of Allaah, our wealth has been destroyed and our children are starving; pray to Allaah for us. He raised his hands and we could not see any cloud in the sky, but by the One in Whose hand is my soul, no sooner had he lowered them but there appeared clouds like mountains. Then he did not step down from the minbar but I saw rain flowing down his beard (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on one who raises his hand when the khateeb is praying for the Muslims in the second khutbah? Please quote the evidence, may Allaah reward you. He replied: Raising the hands is not prescribed in the Friday khutbah or in the Eid khutbah, for the imam or the congregation. Rather what is prescribed is to listen attentively to the khutbah and say Ameen to the du’aa’ quietly without raising one's voice. As for raising the hands, that is not prescribed, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not raise his hands during the Friday khutbah or the Eid khutbah, and when one of the Sahaabah saw one of the governors raising his hands in the Friday khutbah, he criticized him for that and said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not raise (his hands). Yes, if he prays for rain during the Friday khutbah, then he may raise his hands when praying for rain, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to raise his hands in that situation. So if he prays for rain in the Friday khutbah or in the Eid khutbah, then it is prescribed for him to raise his hands, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). End quote from Majmoo’ al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (12/339). And Allaah knows best."
172,How to Make Du’a,"Question What is the etiquette of making du’a and what are the obligatory duties and Sunnahs thereof? How should it start and how should it end? Can we ask for worldly things before asking with regard to the Hereafter? How correct is it to raise the hands when making du’a, and how should it be done if it is correct?","Praise be to Allah.Du’a is worship Allah loves to be asked, and He encourages that in all things. He is angry with the one who does not ask of Him and He encourages His slaves to ask of Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation).” [Ghafir 40:60] Du’a is very important in Islam , so much so that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Du’a is worship.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3372; Abu Dawud, 1479; Ibn Majah, 3828; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2590) The etiquette of du’a 1. The one who is making du’a should believe in Tawhid with regard to the divinity, Lordship, names and attributes of Allah. His heart should be filled with Tawhid. In order for Allah to respond to the du’a, it is essential that the person should be responding to his Lord by obeying Him and not disobeying Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.” [al-Baqarah 2:186] 2. Sincerity towards Allah Alone in making du’a . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).” [al-Bayyinah 98:5] Du’a is worship, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, so sincerity (ikhlas) is a condition of its being accepted. 3. We should ask of Allah by His most beautiful names . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names.” [al-A’raf 7:180] 4. We should praise Allah as He deserves before we call upon Him. Al-Tirmidhi (3476) narrated that Fadalah ibn ‘Ubayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting, a man came in and prayed and said, “O Allah, forgive me and have mercy on me.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “You have been too hasty, O worshipper. When you have prayed and are sitting, praise Allah as He deserves to be praised, and send blessings upon me, then call upon Him.” According to another version (3477): “When one of you prays, let him start with praise of Allah, then let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then let him ask whatever he likes after that.” Then another man prayed after that, and he praised Allah and sent blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O worshipper, ask and you will be answered.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2765, 2767) 5. Sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every du’a is kept back until you send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” Narrated by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat, 1/220; classed as sahهh by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4399. 6. Facing towards the qiblah. Muslim (1763) narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: On the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at the mushrikin, who were one thousand strong, and his Companions numbered three hundred and nineteen. Then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands and started to cry out to his Lord: “O Allah, grant me what You have promised me, O Allah, give me what You have promised me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims perishes, You will not be worshipped on earth.” He kept on crying out to his Lord, stretching forth his hands, facing towards the qiblah, until his cloak fell from his shoulders… Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: This shows that it is mustahabb to face towards the qiblah when making du’a, and to raise the hands. 7. Raising the hands . Abu Dawud (1488) narrated that Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, is Kind and Most Generous, and He is too kind to let His slave, if he raises his hands to Him, bring them back empty.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1320. The palm of the hand should be raised heavenwards, in the manner of a humble beggar who hopes to be given something. Abu Dawud (1486) narrated from Malik ibn Yasar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you ask of Allah, ask of Him with the palms of your hands, not with the backs of them.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1318. Should the hands be held together when raising them or should there be a gap between them? Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (4/25) that they should be held together. What he said is: “As for separating them and holding them far apart from one another, there is no basis for that in the Sunnah or in the words of the scholars.” End quote. 8. Having certain faith that Allah will respond, and focusing with proper presence of mind, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Call upon Allah while you are certain of a response, and remember that Allah will not answer a du’a that comes from a negligent and heedless heart.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3479; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2766. 9. Asking frequently. A person should ask his Lord for whatever he wants of the good things in this world and the Hereafter, and he should beseech Allah in du’a, and not seek a hasty response, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The slave will receive a response so long as his du’a does not involve sin or severing of family ties, and so long as he is not hasty.” It was said, “What does being hasty mean?” He said: “When he says, ‘I made du’a and I made du’a, and I have not seen any response,’ and he gets frustrated and stops making du’a.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6340; Muslim, 2735. 10. He should be firm in his du’a, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should say, ‘O Allah, forgive me if You wish, O Allah, have mercy on me if You wish’; he should be firm in his asking, for Allah cannot be compelled.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6339; Muslim, 2679. 11. Beseeching, humility, hope and fear. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.” [al-A'raf 7:55] “Verily, they used to hasten to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.” [al-Anbiya’ 21:90] “And remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and with fear and without loudness in words in the mornings and in the afternoons.” [al-A'raf 7:205] 12. Saying du’as three times. Al-Bukhari (240) and Muslim (1794) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was praying at the Ka’bah, Abu Jahl and his companions were sitting nearby. They had slaughtered a camel the previous day, and Abu Jahl said: “Which of you will go and get the abdominal contents of the camel of Banu So and So and put it on the back of Muhammad when he prostrates?” The worst of the people went and got it, and when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated, he placed it between his shoulders. They started laughing, leaning against one another. I was standing there watching, and if I had had any power, I would have lifted it from the back of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained in prostration, not lifting his head, until someone went and told Fatimah. She came with Juwayriyah, and lifted it from him, then she turned to them and rebuked them. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished his prayer, he raised his voice and prayed against them – and when he made du’a or asked of Allah he would repeat it three times – and he said: “O Allah, punish Quraysh” three times. When they heard his voice, they stopped laughing and were afraid because of his du’a. Then he said, “O Allah, punish Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, ‘Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, Shaybah ibn Rabi'ah, al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah, Umayyah ibn Khalaf and ‘Uqbah ibn Abu Mu’ayt,” and he mentioned the seventh but I cannot remember who it was. By the One Who sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with the truth, I saw those whom he had named slain on the day of Badr, then they were dragged and thrown into the well, the well of Badr. 13. Ensuring that one’s food and clothing are good (i.e., halal). Muslim (1015) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, Allah is Good and does not accept anything but that which is good. Allah enjoins upon the believers the same as He enjoined upon the Messengers. He says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘O (you) Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well-Acquainted with what you do.’ [al-Muminun 23:51] ‘O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with.’ [al-Baqarah 2:172] Then he mentioned a man who travels for a long distance and is disheveled and dusty, and he stretches forth his hands towards heaven saying, ‘O Lord, O Lord,’ but his food is haram, his drink is haram, his clothing is haram, he has been nourished with haram, so how can he be responded to? Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ensuring that one’s food, drink and clothing are halal, and that one is nourished with halal, is a means of having one’s du’a answered. End quote. 14. Saying du’a silently and not out loud. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.” [al-A'raf 7:55] And Allah praised His slave Zakariyya (peace be upon him) by saying (interpretation of the meaning): “When he called to his Lord (Allah) a call in secret.” [Maryam 19:3] We have also discussed du’a and specific means by which a person may receive a response, as well as the etiquette of du’a and the times and places when a response may be hoped for, the state in which a person should be when making du’a, impediments to a response to du’a and the types of response. All of that may be found in the answer to question no. 5113 . And Allah knows best."
173,Does a cat invalidate one’s prayer?,Question If my pet cat walkes infront of me or sits infront of me while I'm praying what must I do carry on my prayers of or cut off and shoo it away?,"Praise be to Allah. Prayer is invalidated if one of three things mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) walks in front of the worshipper. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Prayer is invalidated by a woman, a donkey or a dog; that may be prevented by something equal in height to the back of a saddle [placed in front of the worshipper as a sutrah or screen].” (Narrated by Muslim, 511). According to one report, “a black dog.” The narrator said: “I said, ‘O Abu Dharr, what is the difference between a black dog and a red or yellow dog?’ He said, ‘O son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the same question, and he said, “The black dog is a devil.”’” (Narrated by Muslim, 510). This ruling applies if one of the things mentioned passes in front of the worshipper and he does not have a sutrah or object to serve as a screen in front of him. But if he has a screen in front of him and the person or animal passes beyond that sutrah, then his prayer is not affected, because of the hadeeth of Abu Juhayfah who said: “I heard my father narrating that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led them in prayer in al-Bat-ha’, and in front of them was an ‘anzah (a short spear, iron-tipped at its lower end). He prayed two rak’ahs for Zuhr followed by two rak’ahs for ‘Asr, and a woman and a donkey passed in front of him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 495). This ruling applies to the imaam and to one who is praying alone; with regard to the members of a congregation praying behind an imaam, the sutrah of the imaam is also a sutrah for them. See question no. 3404. As for cats, they do not invalidate the prayer even if they pass in front of you, because the basic guideline is that the prayer is valid, and there is no evidence to suggest that cats can invalidate the prayer. But the worshipper should try hard to ensure that nothing passes in front of him. ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb narrated from his father that his grandfather said: “We stopped with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Thaniyyat Adhaakhir and the time for prayer came, so he prayed facing a wall which lay in the direction of the qiblah, and we were behind him. A lamb came and tried to pass in front of him and he kept pushing it back until its belly was pushed up against the wall, then it passed behind him.” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 708; al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood, it is hasan saheeh, 652). Question: are cats taahir (pure) or naajis (impure)? Answer: cats are taahir, and based on that, if a cat drinks from a vessel of water, the vessel does not become impure, because of the hadeeth of Kabshah bint Ka’b ibn Maalik, who was in the house of Abu Qutaadah: “Abu Qutaadah came in and I poured water for him to do wudoo’. A cat came and drank some of the water so he tilted the vessel to let it drink. He saw me looking at him and said, ‘Do you find it strange, O daughter of my brother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that they are not naajis, rather they are among those who go around amongst you.’” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 92; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.."
174,"Does the father have to treat his children equitably in terms of gift giving, even if his daughters are married?","Question My father died thirteen years ago, leaving behind some debt and some properties. My two brothers paid off my father’s debt and paid the costs of my marriage and my education. During his lifetime, my father purchased two pieces of property and registered them in the names of some of my brothers. He also stated clearly on more than one occasion that he would buy a property for me and register it in my name too. Please note that all my sisters were married at that time, and now they are saying that my brothers do not have any right to keep these properties, because Islam forbids favouring some children over others. Does the hadith which speak of that apply to married daughters too?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is obligatory to treat both sons and daughters equitably in terms of inheritance and gift giving. Being equitable is obligatory with regard to inheritance, so the estate must be divided equitably, as Allah, may He be exalted, divided it in His book: with each male having a share equal to the share of two females, whether the females are married or unmarried. So it is not permissible to deprive the female of her share because of marriage. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two thirds of one's estate. And if there is only one, for her is half. And for one's parents, to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children. But if he had no children and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is one third. And if he had brothers [or sisters], for his mother is a sixth, after any bequest he [may have] made or debt. Your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [These shares are] an obligation [imposed] by Allah . Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise} [an-Nisa’ 4:11]. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: We have some customs and traditions which deprive women of inheritance after they get married. Please note that the women themselves do not ask for their rights. What is the Islamic ruling, in your view, O Shaykh? He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: Marriage does not deprive anyone of inheritance, and these traditions are invalid. The fact that she got married, and that she is the sister of the deceased, or the daughter of the deceased, or the wife of the deceased, does not mean that she should be deprived of her right. If someone dies and leaves behind five daughters, or ten daughters, some of whom are married and some of whom are not married, they all have a share in the estate. Or if someone dies and leaves behind sisters, or he dies and leaves behind his mother and she is married, each person should be given his or her share. Marriage is not a reason to deprive anyone of his or her share, and taking this matter lightly is a reprehensible action. But if the woman is of sound mind and gives up her share to the one who is not married, and she says: I am in no need because I am married, praise be to Allah, and I give you my share – if she gives it up, and she is of sound mind and mature thinking, and she says to her sisters: I give my share to you, there is nothing wrong with that. But if she is deprived of her share because she is married, that is not permissible.""(Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb 19/443)."
175,Writing reports for students or taking them from the internet,"Question I read on your website a fatwa saying that it is haram to write a report for students in return for money. I wonder what will the ruling be if the teacher knows that someone else is making the report for the student, not the student himself. Those who make the reports often take the topics from the internet, sometimes the students are asked by teachers to take the topic of the report from the internet. Is it still haram in the case I just mentioned? I’m asking because I made reports for students before but I stopped after I read the fatwa on your website.","Praise be to Allah.The aim behind reports or research that students are asked to prepare is to train them in researching and to test their abilities in doing so, and to get them used to referring to references and so on. So the students themselves must do it, and it is not permissible to prepare these reports for them, in return for payment or otherwise, because that is deceiving and lying and corrupting the new generation, and graduating weak students who cannot deal with the references properly. It is permissible for a student to benefit from the research of others, and to take things from the internet or ask for help from some of his classmates, in some minor issues, which is something that applies to all those who are involved in research. But as for taking a complete report from someone else, this is deceit and cheating, whether he takes it from another student or from the internet, and the professor who approves of that or encourages it is partaking in the sin. See also the answer to question no. 95893. You have done well to stop writing reports for students, and we ask Allaah to forgive what has happened in the past and to reward you and bless you with an abundant, halaal income. And Allaah knows best."
176,Eating seven dates in the morning and the impact of believing in that on the healing effect,"Question I have Qs regarding eating dates and magic. Can one eat 'any' dates in 7, or they must be ajwa? And if only ajwa, then must they only be ajwa from Al-'Aliya? And do they benefit before magic is spelled on someone or after it is spelled and one is afflicted with sihr? Or both, before and after? Before, they are like shield from sihr? And after, they have healing effect? And do they benefit only someone who believes in these ahaadeeth? Or anyone? i mean, a Muslim only? .","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: Al-Bukhaari (5445) and Muslim (2047) narrated from Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats seven ‘ajwah dates in the morning, will not be harmed by any poison or witchcraft that day.” Most of the scholars are of the view that this applies only to the dates of Madinah, and specifically to a particular type of the dates of Madinah, namely ‘ajwah dates, which grow in ‘Aaliyat al-Madinah. This is most likely to be correct, and it is the apparent meaning of the hadith. Some scholars are of the view that it is general in meaning, and that all types of dates are efficacious against poison and witchcraft. Among those who were of this view among contemporary scholars are Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa‘di, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, and Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on them). This has been discussed previously in question no. 205041. Some of the scholars are of the view that the hadith applies specifically to the people of Madinah and those in the vicinity, because of their physical makeup which is accustomed to that environment. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadith is addressed to a specific audience, such as the people of Madinah and those in the vicinity. End quote from Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/90). Secondly: The hadith clearly states that eating dates in the morning is efficacious in warding off witchcraft before it occurs, but it is not far-fetched to suggest that they would also have the effect of removing it after it occurred, especially since it is well-known that witchcraft may be undone by means of treatment with remedies and ruqyah as prescribed in sharee‘ah, so the sorcerer would have to repeat the spell that he cast on that person. For that reason, the sick person should persist in eating seven dates every morning until he is fully recovered and so that he may be safe in the future – by Allah’s leave – from the harm of sorcerers and devils. Thirdly: The one who acts in accordance with these hadiths may find the effect of protection against poison and witchcraft, even if he does not believe in it, as it says in the story of the one who was stung by a scorpion [who was a disbeliever], who was treated with ruqyah by reciting Soorat al-Faatihah over him. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadith refers to achieving healing by reciting al-Faatihah over the person who had been stung, so that he no longer needed regular medicine, and perhaps it healed him far better than regular medicine could have done, even though the recipient of the treatment was not the best candidate, either because the people of this tribe were not Muslim or because they were miserly and mean people. So how about if he had been a good candidate for such treatment? End quote from Madaarij as-Saalikeen (1/79). But having faith in the remedy will make it more effective and will make one more receptive to healing. This applies to all types of medicine, but in the case of psychological disease it is more effective than in the case of physical disease. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Many remedies are more effective if one has faith in them and takes them willingly and happily. People have seen wonders in that regard, because in that case human nature is highly receptive to medicine, and the soul feels joy in having it, which revives the patient’s strength and reinforces his natural defences, causing his body’s resources to come together to resist disease and ward off the harm. On the other hand, many medicines may be effective for a particular disease, but what nullifies their effect is if the patient does not believe in the remedy and his body does not accept it, so it does not help him at all. You may think of the greatest medicines and remedies, and the most beneficial for hearts and bodies, and the most useful in this world and the hereafter, namely the Qur’an which is healing for every disease, and how it does not benefit hearts that do not believe that it contains healing and benefit; rather it only increases them in (spiritual) sickness. There is no medicine that could heal hearts more effectively than the Qur’an, for it brings complete healing for hearts that does not leave any sickness behind, but it cures it, and it preserves (spiritual) health in perfect order, granting full protection from every harmful thing. In spite of that, the fact that most hearts turn away from it (the Qur’an) and do not have firm belief in it, when there is no doubt that it is a healing, and they fail to use it and ignore it in favour of other medicines that are put together by human beings, prevents hearts from attaining healing; habits and customs take over, aversion becomes greater, chronic diseases and sickness become entrenched in people’s hearts, and patients and doctors become accustomed to human remedies and what their shaykhs and those whom they venerate and hold in high esteem prescribe for them, thus the calamity is exacerbated and the disease worsens. Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/92). And Allah knows best."
177,Does the fact that Allah answers the prayers of the disbelievers indicate that what they believe is true?,"Question I am a Muslim convert, Alhamdulillah. I was raised a misguided Christian kaafir, and then Allah guided me to Islam and the Sunnah. However, I then adopted Shiite beliefs and did many horrible sins like insulting the Sahaba of the Prophet : such as Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Lady Aisha, etc (May Allah Bless Them All). I have just repented and returned to the Sunnah and I am a Sunni Muslim insha'Allah and Alhamdulillah! I'm crying in repentance, may Allah accept it. What should I do with Shi'ite books I have since they have the name of Allah written in them should I put them away somewhere or throw them out? Also I suffer from terrible waswas (likely from the sins of cursing the sahaba, and lying against Allah with blasphemies like comparing his creation to him with the Shi'ites so-called ""12 Imams"" which are all scholars of Ahl al-Sunnha like Ali ibn Abi Talib RA, etc. and the Mahdi will be born later at the end of time when the Muslim Prophet Isa AS returns). I don't even want to speak of them, as I know the hadith says not to talk or act upon the waswas one hears. But I feel as if the shaytan is giving me horrific waswas to try to scare me about whether the Deen I know is true really is true Allah FORGIVE ME (I'm nearly crying as I write this)!!! The shaytan's waswas tells me ""are you sure about Allah"" and then shaytan scares me with thoughts that other accursed kuffar pagan religions allegedly are ""appealing"" I know the hadith tells us that at the time of death these fears can occur 60191 And you said this the greatest trial. I know that Allah is the truth and Islam is the only salvation from the accursed hellfire Allah Protect me. Allah is One and Prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah is his slave and final Messenger. And all the Prophets AS throughout history were Muslims as well. Also how do we answer claims of the kuffar (like Christians, Jews, etc) who claim that their kuffar false ""prayers"" allegedly produced them ""miracles"" we know that Allah will answer the person who calls upon him and that this world is a test. I found this link interesting http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/faith-and-worship/heart-and-soul/166077-does-allah-answer-the-prayers-of-non-muslims.html?Soul= ""But what about those millions of people around the world who will tell you that Jesus or such-and-such saint or anyone else answered their prayers? What they got in response was no more than what was already written for them. Even if they hadn’t prayed, they would have got that thing. Nothing happens by coincidence or chance in the meaning that it was unplanned by Allah. Only sincere supplication to God (Allah) alone can change what is written. So, Allah (God) does answer non-Muslims when they ask Him for something. Anything else they get is only what was already written for them."" Also it makes me feel good to read about the stories of the miracles Allah bestowed on the Prophet and upon the righteous Muslims today like being cured of diseases like cancer see one example an American Muslim convert woman named Aminah Assilmi.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Who has guided you to Islam and given you the blessing of Tawheed (belief in His Oneness), and has brought you back to the truth by His grace, kindness and blessing. We ask Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth and to guide you to true guidance and goodness, and to help you to fear Him in word and deed. You have done well by wishing to learn and in your eagerness to find out the truth. We ask Allah to bless you with understanding of Islam. Secondly: If you know of some daa‘iyahs (callers to Islam) and seekers of knowledge who are trustworthy in terms of their knowledge and methodology, who need such books in order to refute the Shi‘ah and point out how they are misguided, you could give these books to them, so long as they are safe from their evil and can make use of them in calling people to the right way. If you are not able to do that, then you can destroy them by burning them, burying them or cutting them up in such a way as to obscure verses of the Qur’aan and names of Allah, and if some words remain visible that does not matter. You could use a paper shredder for this purpose. Please see also the answer to question no. 5390 Thirdly: What you are facing of waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) is something ordinary that happens to believers; you should not be worried or distracted by it, but you have to try to get rid of it by doing the following: 1.Seeking refuge with Allah and seeking His help 2.Remembering Allah and trying to control your thoughts so that you can put a stop to these whispers 3.Focusing strongly on worship and following the commands of Allah, seeking His pleasure thereby. When you focus completely on worship in a serious and real manner, you will forget about the distraction of these whispers, in sha Allah. 4.Turning to Allah a great deal and calling upon Him in du‘aa’, asking Him to heal you from this problem. Please see also the answer to question no. 12315 Fourthly: Du‘aa’ (supplication) is of two types: 1.Du‘aa’ in the sense of worship. What is meant is that a person worships Allah, may He be exalted, persistently with any kind of worship, in the heart, by physical actions or in financial terms. 2.Du‘aa’ in the sense of asking, which is asking to be given that which is of benefit or for that which is harmful to be warded off. In other words it is asking Allah, may He be exalted, for that which will benefit one in this world and in the Hereafter, and to ward off that which will harm him in this world and in the Hereafter. This is something that believers and non-believers have in common. Please see the answer to question no. 113177 Fifthly: The supplication of the disbelievers, if it is a supplication to someone other than Allah, such as the supplication of the Christians to their object of worship the Messiah (peace be upon him) or to the Virgin Mary, or the supplication of idol worshippers to their idols, is a supplication based on misguidance that will not bring any benefit; rather it will be a cause of punishment for them in the Hereafter, because it is associating others with Allah, may He be exalted. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “For Him (Alone) is the Word of Truth (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but He). And those whom they (polytheists and disbelievers) invoke, answer them no more than one who stretches forth his hand (at the edge of a deep well) for water to reach his mouth, but it reaches him not, and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but an error (i.e. of no use)” [ar-Ra ‘d 13:14]. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (2/785): What is meant is that just as the one who stretches forth his hand to the water, either to take some of it from a distance will not benefit from the water that does not reach his mouth, similarly these mushrikeen who worship another god alongside Allah will never benefit from that in this world or in the Hereafter. End quote. Sixthly: The supplication of the disbelievers to Allah may be answered sometimes, for reasons such as establishing proof against the disbelievers or to prove their disbelief, denial and stubbornness; or to restore justice to those among them who have been wronged, because Allah enjoins justice and forbids injustice; or because He has guaranteed to provide for them in this world, so if they ask Him for provision He grants it to them; or to manifest His kindness, generosity and blessing to all people. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah Alone). But when He brings you safely to land, you turn away (from Him). And man is ever ungrateful” [al-Isra’ 17:67]. “Say (O Muhammad ): Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea (dangers like storms), when you call upon Him in humility and in secret (saying): If He (Allah) only saves us from this (danger), we shall truly be grateful. Say (O Muhammad ): Allah rescues you from it and from all (other) distresses, and yet you worship others besides Allah” [al-An‘aam 6: 63-64] “Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations. Is there any ilah (god) with Allah? Little is that you remember!” [an-Naml 27:62] “And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the Blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily! Man is indeed an extreme wrong-doer, - a disbeliever (an extreme ingrate, denies Allah’s Blessings by disbelief, and by worshipping others besides Allah, and by disobeying Allah and His Prophet Muhammad )” [Ibraaheem 14:34]. The apparent meaning of these verses indicates that the fact that Allah answers some of the prayers of the disbelievers is to prove their disbelief and denial, and to establish proof against them, or to manifest His mercy, grace and kindness by helping those who are in desperate need and saving those who are in distress. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear the prayer of the oppressed, even if he is a disbeliever, for there is no barrier (between it and Allah).” Narrated by Ahmad, 12140; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Targheeb wa’t-Tarheeb, 2231 This indicates that Allah responds to the prayer of the disbeliever who is wronged, because Allah enjoins justice and forbids injustice, and He restores justice to those who are wronged even if they are disbelievers, because His justice is perfect. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 1/206: All of mankind, both believers and disbelievers, ask of Allah and Allah may answer the supplication of the disbeliever. If the disbelievers ask Allah for provision, He grants them provision and water. If harm touches them at sea, they will turn to no one except Him. Then when He brings them safely to land, they turn away and man is ever ungrateful. End quote. He also said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 1/233: With regard to answering the prayers of those who ask, in general terms Allah answers the supplication of the one who is in distress and of the one who is wronged, even if he is a disbeliever. End quote. Seventhly: The fact that Allah answers the supplication of the disbelievers does not imply that He loves them or that He supports or honours them, or that He is pleased with their religion and beliefs. Rather that might be part of letting them get carried away (in their misguidance) and hastening good things for them in this world so that they may taste the punishment in the Hereafter. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not love the disbelievers and is not pleased with them or their disbelief. Ibn al-Qayyim said in Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/13: Not everyone whose supplication Allah answers has attained His pleasure or love, nor is He pleased with his actions. He may answer the prayers of the righteous and evildoers, believers and disbelievers. Many people offer supplication in which they overstep the mark, or stipulate conditions, or ask for things for which it is not permissible to ask. Then they get that or some of it, and they think that their actions are righteous and pleasing to Allah, but they are in the same position as one who is given abundant wealth and children so that he might get carried away (in his misguidance), whilst he thinks that Allah is hastening to give him all good things. But Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.” [al-An‘aam 6:44]. Supplication may be an act of worship for which the one who does it will be rewarded, or it may be asking to have one’s needs met but that may be harmful to the individual: either he will be punished as a result of what he gets or he will be lowered in status, so he gets his needs met but is punished for neglecting his duties or overstepping the mark. End quote. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, p. 89 Not everyone to whom Allah grants provision and help, whether in response to his supplication or otherwise, is among those whom Allah loves and helps; rather He, may He be glorified, grants provision to believers and disbelievers, righteous and evildoers. He may answer their supplication to give them what they ask for in this world, but they have no share of the hereafter. The scholars stated that some disbelievers who were Christians besieged a Muslim city and their water ran out, so they asked the Muslims to give them some fresh water and they would lift the siege from them. The Muslim leaders discussed the matter and said, rather we should leave them until thirst has weakened them, then we can defeat them. Then the Christians prayed for rain and asked Allah to give them water, and He answered their prayer. Some of the common people were confused, so the king said to one of the scholars: Say something to explain the situation to the people. So he issued instructions that a minbar be set up for him and he said: O Allah, we know that these are among those whose provision You have guaranteed, as You say (interpretation of the meaning): “And no (moving) living creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah” [Hood 11:6]. They called upon You in distress, and You answer the one who is in distress when he calls upon You. You granted them rain, because You have guaranteed their provision and because they called upon You in distress, not because You love them or because You love their religion. Now we want to see a sign that will make faith steadfast in the hearts of Your believing slaves. So Allah sent against them (the enemy) a wind that destroyed them, and so on. Under this heading also comes one who may offer supplication but overstep the mark in doing so, either by asking for that which is not appropriate or by offering supplication in which there is disobedience towards Allah, whether it be by associating others with Him (shirk) or otherwise. Then if he gets some of what he wanted, he think that this is an indication that his deed was righteous. He is like the one who is given abundant wealth and sons so that might get carried away (in his misguidance), so he thinks that good things have been hastened for him. But Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Do they think that We enlarge them in wealth and children, We hasten unto them with good things (in this worldly life so that they will have no share of good things in the Hereafter)? Nay, but they perceive not” [al-Mu’minoon 23:55]. Eighthly: When Allah answers some of the supplications of the disbelievers, it takes the form of fulfilling some of their wishes with regard to worldly matters. But when Allah answers the supplication of the Muslim, one of three things happen: either he is given what he asked for, or an equivalent evil is diverted from him, or it (the reward for the supplication) is stored up for him in the Hereafter. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who offers supplication in which there is no sin or severing of ties of kinship, but Allah will give him one of three things in return for it: either what he asked for will be hastened for him, or (reward) will be stored up for him in the Hereafter or an equivalent evil will be diverted from him.” Narrated by Ahmad, 10749; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh, 2199 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Baari, 11/95: Everyone who offers supplication receives a response, but the response may vary. Sometimes he will get exactly what he asked for, and sometimes he will be compensated (with something equivalent). There are saheeh hadeeths which speak of that. End quote. And Allah knows best."
178,Following the funeral procession of one who used to pray to graves for help,Question What is the ruling on following the funeral procession of a person who has died and who used to pray to graves for help?,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen, who replied: If when he died he was persisting in calling on the dead for help, it is not permissible to follow his funeral procession. If nobody discussed this issue with him, we should look to see whether he was in a land there were any pure monotheists who propagated the message of Tahweed and if there were any ways in which he could have learned about Tawheed. It is most likely that proof was established against him, so we should not follow his funeral procession. Otherwise we may do so. And Allah knows best."
179,Is istikhaarah valid on the part of a boy who has not yet reached puberty?,Question I would like to ask you about Istikarah that is there any age limit for Istikarah mean someone has to be an adult for doing istikarah? And also would like to know that is there any harmful affects after doing Istikarah? I will be grateful if you answer my those questions.,"Praise be to Allah. Istikhaarah means seeking guidance from Allah, may He be exalted, to choose the best option. What it involves is delegating the decision to Him, may He be glorified, for He knows best what is good for His slave and is able to bring about what is best for the one who is seeking His guidance, if he calls upon Him and asks Him to guide him to the best option. Fayd al-Qadeer (5/442) Istikhaarah prayer is a prayer offered by the individual when he is thinking of doing something and does not know whether it is better to do it or refrain, so he asks Allah to guide him to the best choice regarding it. There is no particular age for offering istikhaarah prayer, so it is valid on the part of an adult or the part of boy who has not yet reached puberty, if he has reached the age of discernment. Acts of worship are valid if done by a child who has reached the age of discernment. In most cases the age of discernment is around the age of seven years. Therefore the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us to instruct our children to pray when they are seven years old. If obligatory prayer is valid on the part of a boy who has reached the age of discernment, and it is even valid for him to lead the prayer, as we have seen previously in fatwa no. 155061, then it is more appropriate to say that a supererogatory (naafil) prayer (including istikhaarah) offered by him is valid. The Muslim should combine asking Allah, may He be exalted, to guide him to what is best with consulting people who are religiously committed and wise, because as the saying goes: He will not be disappointed, whoever asks Allah to guide him to the best option (istikhaarah) and he will never regret it, the one who seeks the advice of others. Istikhaarah is all good for the individual, and there cannot be any negative effects of istikhaarah, because it is praying to Allah, may He be exalted, calling upon Him and delegating the matter to Him – and all of that is good, and nothing bad can result from what is good. So the Muslim should pray istikhaarah and consult others, then put his trust in Allah and make a decision, and Allah will decree for him what is good, in sha Allah. And Allah knows best."
180,Raising the hands in prayer,"Question Dear Sir, Assalam-o-alaikum, Give us explanation of rafayadain in the prayer. Is It permissible or not.","Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to raise his hands for takbeerat al-ihram (the takbeer at the beginning of the prayer), sometimes whilst saying the takbeer, sometimes after it and sometimes before. (al-Bukhaari and al-Nisaa’i) When he had finished reciting Qur’aan, he would pause for a moment then raise his hands, say takbeer and do rukoo’. (Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), p. 128). He used to raise his hands when he stood up from rukoo’ (reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and this raising of the hands is mutawaatir (reported by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). It is the opinion of the majority of scholars and of some of the Hanafis. (Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by al-Albaani, p. 136). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say takbeer when he got up for the third rak’ah (reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and he would raise his hands sometimes when he said this takbeer. (al-Bukhaari and Abu Dawood). (Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), p. 177). Raising the hands in prayer was a well-known practice among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Imaam al-Bukhaari said: “Al-Hasan and Humayd ibn Hilaal said: ‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) all used to raise their hands, without exception.” (Juz’ raf’ al-yadayn, p. 26, ma’a jila’ al-‘aynayn). Ibn al-Qayyim said: “Look at the practice at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Sahaabah after him. They used to raise their hands in prayer when doing rukoo’, and when standing up again. And in the time of the Sahaabah, if ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar saw someone not raising his hands in prayer, he would throw a stone at him. [next phrase is unclear]. (I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 2/376). So what is proven in the Sunnah with regard to raising the hands in prayer is that they should be raised at four points in the prayer: when pronouncing takbeerat al-ihraam, when doing rukoo’, when standing up from rukoo’, and after standing up from the first tashahhud. And Allaah knows best."
181,Fasting on Mondays and Thursdays or on Three Days of each Month?,"Question Which is better: fasting three days of each month or fasting on Mondays and Thursdays? What are the ahadeeth which have been narrated concerning these fasts? What are the three days of each month – are they the 13th, 14th and 15th of each month? What is the evidence?","Praise be to Allah.Which is better, fasting on Mondays and Thursdays or on three days of each month? If we want to discover which is better, fasting on Mondays and Thursdays or fasting three days of each month, we find that fasting on Mondays and Thursdays is better than fasting on three days of each month. This is because if a person fasts on Mondays and Thursdays each week, that means that he is fasting eight days each month, so he will have done both: fasted on Mondays and Thursdays and fasted three days of the month. The three days of each month may be fasted at the beginning of the month, in the middle or at the end, and may be done separately or consecutively. But it is better to fast on the ayyam al-beed, which are the days on which the moon is full, namely the 13th, 14th and 15th of each lunar month. Virtues of fasting on Mondays and Thursdays There follow a number of ahadeeth which encourage fasting on Mondays and Thursdays: 1 –Abu Qatadah al-Ansari narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about fasting on Mondays. He said: “On that day I was born, and on it the Revelation came to me.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1162) 2 – ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was keen to fast on Mondays and Thursdays. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 745; al-Nasai, 2361; Ibn Majah, 1739; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1044) 3 –Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Deeds are shown (to Allah) on Mondays and Thursdays, and I like my deeds to be shown when I am fasting.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 747; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1041) Virtues of fasting on three days of each month The following ahaadeeth encourage fasting on three days of each month: 1 –Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “My close friend [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] advised me to do three things which I will not give up until I die: fasting three days of each month, praying Duha, and sleeping after Witr. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1124; Muslim, 721) 2 –Mu'ahadah al-‘Adawiyyah narrated that she asked ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fast three days of every month?” She said, “Yes.” She said to her: “Which days of the month did he fast?” She said, “He did not mind which days of the month he would fast.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1160) 3 –Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting three days of each month is fasting for a lifetime, and ayyam al-beed are the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 2420; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1040) 4 –Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me: “If you fast any part of the month, then fast the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 761; al-Nasai, 2424; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1038) What days of the month should you fast? There is broad scope in the command to fast three days, as it says in the hadeeth of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), but the best days of the month for fasting are the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth, as it says in the other saheeh ahaadeeth. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When fasting three days of every month, is it essential that it be only on the ayyam al-beed? Or is it permissible to fast any three days of the month? He replied: It is permissible to fast at the beginning of the month, in the middle or at the end, on consecutive days or separately. But it is better if it is done on the three ayyaam al-beed, which are the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on three days of every month, and he did not mind whether he fasted at the beginning or at the end of the month.” (Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 20/question no. 376) For more on fasting Mondays and Thursdays, please see these answers: 5415 , 106468 , and 109217 . And Allah knows best."
182,Can we do what we want?,"Question I have some questions about Islam, could you explain them for me? Are all of man’s actions, such as birth, death, his day-to-day behaviour, and all that he thinks about doing decreed by Allaah? Is our life programmed by Allaah before we are born? Or do we have freedom of choice and can we decide and do whatever we want, without that being controlled by Allaah? In brief, do we do whatever we want or what Allaah has created us to do?.","Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that some of our circumstances are forced on us, and and we have no choice in it, such as the day when a person is born, the colour of his skin and eyes, and when he will die. All of these are matters over which people have no control, rather they happen to them by force. Given that these are matters in which people have no choice, they do not have anything to do with Paradise or Hell, torment or blessing. But some actions are the subject of choice, such as whether to believe or disbelieve, or worldly matters such as choosing what to eat or drink, and where to live. There is nothing of that nature which is entirely outside the will and decree of Allaah. But how does that happen? Belief in al-qadar (the divine will and decree) is one of the pillars of faith. The Muslim’s faith cannot be valid unless he accepts that everything comes from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lawh Al-Mahfooz)” [al-Qamar 54:49] Indeed, the names of Allaah include al-Qaadir, al-Qadeer and al-Muqtadir (which refer to His being All-Powerful). The heart of the matter is that Allaah possesses the attributes of knowledge, power and will. Based on that, if people who do deeds want to do them, whether they are sins or acts of obedience, then Allaah inevitably knows that, indeed He knew that in eternity past, before He even created the universe. Then after He knew it, He wrote it with Him, then when they wanted to do it, He willed that they should do so. If He did not will that, then they would not do it. He is All-Powerful, and He is the Creator of people’s deeds because He is the Creator of the human beings who do them. So all the deeds of mankind are written with Allaah, because Allaah has prior knowledge of them. This does not mean that Allaah compels people to do what they do, rather they have freedom of choice with regard to their deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful” [al-Insaan 76:3] But their actions are not compelled by Allaah, for Allaah does not force His slaves to do anything. Imaam Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi said concerning a similar matter: If it is said, How can Allaah will something that He is not pleased with and does not like? How can He will it and create it? How can His will be reconciled with His hatred for it? It should be said (in response) that this is the question which has caused divisions among the people and has caused them to follow different paths and opinions. It should be noted that what is willed may be of two types: that which is willed or wanted for itself, and that which is willed or wanted for something else. That which is willed or wanted for itself is that which is wanted and loved for what it is and for the goodness it contains. So it comes under the heading of aims and goals. That which is willed or wanted for something else may not be what is wanted, but it serves a purpose; it may not serve any purpose in and of itself, even though it may be a means to attain that which he wants and is aiming for. So it may be something that is disliked in and of itself, but he may seek it because it serves a purpose and helps him reach what he wants. So in this case he will have two opposing feelings, his dislike (of the means) and his desire (for the end). There is no contradiction, as these feelings are related to different things. This is like unpleasant medicine which the one who takes it knows will cure him, or like cutting off a wasted limb when he knows that will save the rest of his body, or travelling a difficult route when he knows that it will bring him to what he wants and loves. The wise man would rather accept the disliked thing on the basis that he is likely to get good results even though the ultimate end may not be quite certain. So how about Allaah, from Whom nothing is hidden? He may dislike something but it may not be against His will for it to exist, because it may be a means to an end, and it may be a means to something that Allaah likes. For example, Allaah created Iblees, who is the cause of the corruption of religions, deeds, beliefs and human wills; but nevertheless he is a means to a lot of things that Allaah likes, which result from the creation of Iblees. For these things to exist is dearer to Allaah than if they did not exist at all. Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah, 252-253."
183,This is not one of the names of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),Question I have baby girl we chosen the name MAHIN some peoples says its name of Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) some says its other meaning kindly tell us exact meaning of this name.,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The scholars strove to compile all the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that are mentioned in the Qur’aan, Sunnah and reports, but they differed concerning that. Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There are many ahaadeeth about that – i.e., the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – and the two great Haafizes Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi and Abu’l-Qaasim ibn ‘Asaakir strove to collect them, and people wrote books on this topic, until some of them wanted to compile one thousand names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The great faqeeh Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki, who wrote a commentary on al-Tirmidhi called al-Ahwadhi, compiled sixty-four names. Al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (2/252). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are of two types: 1 – Unique names that he did not share with any other Messenger, such as Muhammad, Ahmad, al-‘Aaqib (the successor, i.e., the one who succeeds the other Prophets in bringing about good, or the Last Prophet), al-Haashir (the Gatherer), al-Muqaffa (the last Prophet, following in their footsteps) and Nabi al-Malhamah (the Prophet of Jihad). 2 – Names whose meanings he shared with other Messengers, but he attained perfection therein, and he is the only one who attained perfection but he was not the only one who attained these qualities, such as Messenger of Allaah, Prophet of Allaah, slave of Allaah, al-Shaahid (witness), al-Mubashshir (bringer of glad tidings), al-Nadheer (warner), Nabi al-Rahmah (Prophet of Mercy), and Nabi al-Tawbah (Prophet of repentance). But if he is given a name for every one of his attributes, the number of his names passes two hundred, such as al-Saadiq (the Truthful), al-Masdooq (the one who is believed), al-Ra’oof (kind), al-Raheem (compassionate) and so on. Concerning this some people said: Allaah has one thousand names and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has one thousand names. This was said by Abu’l-Khattaab ibn Dihyah, but what he was referring to was his attributes. Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/86). Secondly: After looking for these names, the scholars compiled them, but we could not find among them the name mentioned by the questioner, namely Maheen. Rather it is not possible for this name to be one of the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because its meaning is not befitting for the status of a Prophet and Messenger. Ibn Faaris (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Maheen means despicable or vile. Mu’jam Maqaayees al-Lughah (5/227). Thirdly: Perhaps the questioner has altered the name al-Muhaymin to al-Maheen. Some scholars listed the former as one of the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and in some books it is miscopied as al-Maheen, but this is a grievous error. Those who included the name al-Muhaymin among the names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) quoted as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)” [al-Maa’idah 5:48]. But the majority of mufassireen are of the view that the word muhaymin in this verse refers to the Book, i.e., the Qur’aan, and it is not a description of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him), in his commentary on the phrase “Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)”, mentioned three views held by the salaf: that it mean al-Ameen (the one who entrusted with it), al-Shaahid (the one who bears witness) and al-Haakim (the one who rules concerning its validity), then he said: These views are all close in meaning, and the word al-muhaymin includes them all. So it is trustee, a witness and a judge over every Book that came before it. As for that which was narrated by Ibn Abi Haatim from ‘Ikrimah, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, ‘Ata’ al-Khurasaani and Ibn Abi Nujayh from Mujaahid, that they said that the verse “Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)” referred to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who was entrusted with the Qur’aan, it is correct in the sense that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was entrusted with the Qur’aan but interpreting the verse in this way needs to be examined further. So to sum up, the former meaning is the correct one. Abu Ja’far ibn Jareer said, after narrating it from Mujaahid: This interpretation is far fetched with regard to Arabic language; in fact it is incorrect, because al-muhaymin is mentioned in conjunction with al-musaddiq (translated here as ‘confirming’), so it can only refer to that to which al-musaddiq refers. Tafseer Ibn Katheer (3/128). Fourthly: Our advice to you is to avoid both names: Al-Muhaymin because it is also one of the names of Allaah, may He be exalted, and it is not permissible to give people names that belong only to Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Among the names that it is forbidden to give to people are the names of the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted. End quote. Tuhfat al-Mawdood (120). The same applies to the name al-Maheen, because it carries meanings of humiliation, lowness and insignificance, and the Muslim is proud of his Islam, noble in his faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged us to choose good names in the hope that their owners would attain the noble attributes referred to thereby. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Rarely do you see an ugly name but the one who is given it is ugly or bad. Allaah in His wisdom has decreed that people will be inspired to give names that befit the object named. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “May Allaah keep Aslam safe and sound (saalama) and may Allaah forgive (ghafara) Ghifaar but ‘Usayyah have disobeyed Allaah and His Messenger.” Agreed upon. These were Arab tribes whose names suited them. To sum up, ugly attitudes and deeds dictate names that suit them. Just as that applies to descriptions, it also applies to names of people. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was only called Muhammad and Ahmad because of his many praiseworthy attributes. Hence the banner of praise (al-hamd) will be in his hand and his ummah are those who give praise, and he is the one who gives the most praise to his Lord. Hence the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined giving good names, and he said: “Choose good names.” Narrated by Abu Dawood but its isnaad is da’eef. The one who has a good name will feel shy because of his name and his name may motivate him to do things that suit it and avoid things that are contrary to it. Hence you see that most of those who are vile have names that suit them, and most of those who are good have names that suit them. And Allaah is the source of strength. End quote.

184,"Ruling on putting a car on the market and offering it for sale in the auction, when he does not really want to sell it there; rather he only wants to find out its price","Question Someone wants to buy a product, a car for example, and he stipulates that the vendor must first put his car on the market and offer it for sale, to find out its market price, then the purchaser can buy it from him for the price determined by the market. What is the ruling on putting the product on the market and offering it for sale in the auction, without actually intending to sell it; rather the aim is to find out its market value? Is it permissible for the purchaser to stipulate such a condition in the sale contract?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: In order for a transaction to be valid, it is stipulated that the price be known at the time of drawing up the contract, and determining the price depends on the agreement of both parties to the transaction. But the purchaser may be unaware of prices, so he resorts to this method, which is asking the seller to put it in the auction, in order to determine the highest price that may be offered for it. What appears to us to be the case is that this method is not Islamically acceptable, because it involves deceiving and cheating the people in the market, because they believe that the seller genuinely wants to sell the item, when in fact he does not want to sell it to them, so he is wasting their time and efforts in examining the item and making bids, pretending that he wants to sell the item so that they start competing in offer, but they will get nothing in return. Deceit and cheating are haraam, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Plotting and deceit will be in the Fire.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu‘ab al-Eemaan; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘. Also narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh as a mu‘allaq report, as follows: “Deceit will be in the Fire, and whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.” And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives is not of me.” Narrated by Muslim (102). Moreover, offering the car for sale in the auction will not give its true price, because of what usually happens in auctions of not offering the appropriate price for items; choosing this method of purchase is unfair. The correct way is to show the car to one or two experts so that they can evaluate it, even if you have to pay them something in return for that. According to custom, this is the responsibility of the purchaser, but they [the seller and purchaser] can come to an agreement to share that cost. The purchaser may join the people in the auction, and if he likes the price, he may add a little to the highest bid, or let someone else buy it for him, if the owner is pleased with the final price. Secondly: If the two parties agreed to base the transaction on the highest bid at auction, and the transaction was concluded on that basis before knowing what the final price would be, then this is another reason for disallowing such transactions. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by the words “or the highest bid” is: I will sell it to you for what is settled upon in the auction. This is not valid, because we do not know whether it will settle on a high price or low price. Someone may make false bids to artificially inflate the price, so the price will be higher, or perhaps those in attendance will be few, so the price will be lower. Hence it is not valid to sell it on the basis of the highest bid. And it was said that it is valid, and that selling it on the basis of the highest bid offers more reassurance than selling it after bargaining about the price, because a person may feel assured and say: As people offered this price for it, then this indicates that the value is equivalent to the highest bid. But one may not feel totally sure whether it is valid. What is more likely to be correct is that it is not valid to base the price on the highest bid, because what the highest bid will be is unknown; if there is artificial inflation of prices the price will be higher, and if those in attendance are few, it will be lower. So in this case there is ambiguity in the transaction, hence it should not be sold on the basis of the highest bid. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (8/173). And Allah knows best."
185,How can he maintain his fast in the face of these sins?,Question How can I maintain my fast in the face of these sins?.,"Praise be to Allah.You have done very well to ask this question; it indicates that you are keen to make sure that your acts of worship do not go to waste or be reduced because of these widespread sins. We should all remember that the real meaning of fasting is not only giving up food and drink, rather Allaah, may He be exalted, has enjoined fasting in order that we may attain piety (taqwa). Hence real fasting means refraining from sin by refraining from it and giving it up; this is the fasting of the heart, not just the fasting of the body. The Sunnah points to what we have said, and it has been discussed and explained by the scholars. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allaah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1804). And it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It may be that all a fasting person gets from his fast is hunger and thirst, and it may be that all a person who prays at night gets from his prayer is sleeplessness.” Narrated by Ahmad (8693); classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan (8/257) and by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (1/262). The Sahaabah and the early generations of this ummah were keen for their fasting to be a purification for their souls as well as their bodies, free from disobedience and sin. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Fasting does not mean abstaining from food and drink only, rather it is also abstaining from lying, falsehood and idle speech. Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Ansaari said: When you fast, then let your hearing, sight and tongue fast from lying and sin and stop abusing servants. Be tranquil and dignified on the day of your fast, and do not let the day you do not fast and the day you fast be the same. It was narrated that Hafsah bint al-Sireen – who was a scholar of the Taabi’een – said: Fasting is a shield, so long as one does not make holes in it it, and making holes in it means gheebah (backbiting). It was narrated from Maymoon ibn Mahraam that the least of fasting is giving up food and drink. These reports were quoted by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla (4/308). So it is no wonder if we learn that some scholars regarded the fast as invalid if a person falls into sin during his fast, even though the correct view is that this does not invalidate the fast, but undoubtedly it detracts from it and goes against the real meaning of fasting. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Backbiting damages the fast. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah, and al-Awzaa’i also said this, that backbiting breaks the fast of the fasting person and he has to make up that day. Ibn Hazm went further and said: It is invalidated by every sin that a person commits deliberately, when he is aware that he is fasting, whether it is an action or a word, because of the general meaning of the words “he should not utter obscene speech or behave in an ignorant manner” and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allaah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” End quote. Fath al-Baari (4/104). Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: As for the thing from one which must abstain when fasting, perhaps you will be surprised if I tell you that the thing from one which must abstain when fasting is sin. A person must abstain from sin when fasting because this is the primary aim of fasting, because Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-Baqarah 2:183]. It is not so that you may become hungry, or so that you may become thirsty, or so that you may refrain from relations with your wife! No; He says “that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious).” This is the primary aim of fasting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) affirmed that when he said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it and ignorant behaviour, Allaah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” So if a person refrains from disobeying Allaah, this is true fasting. As for outward fasting, this is abstaining from things that invalidate the fast and refraining from things that break the fast from dawn until sunset as an act of worship towards Allaah, because of the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. We call this kind of fasting outward fasting, which is the fasting of the body only. As for the fasting of the heart, which is the primary aim of fasting, this means refraining from disobedience towards Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. Based on this, if a person observes the fast outwardly, in the physical sense, but he does not fast in his heart, then his fast is severely deficient, but we do not say that it is invalid, rather we say that it is lacking. Similarly, we say concerning prayer that the aim of prayer is humility before Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and prayer of the heart comes before prayer of the limbs, but if a person prays physically but not with his heart, not focusing at all, then his prayer is very deficient, but it is still valid as it appears to be, but is very deficient. Similarly the fast is very deficient if a person does not refrain from disobeying Allaah, but it is valid, because acts of worship in this world are to be judged as they appear to be. End quote. Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftoohah (116, p. 1). Secondly: The scholars divided patience into three categories: patience in obeying Allaah, patience in refraining from disobeying Him, and patience in accepting the Divine decree. Fasting combines all these kinds of patience. Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The best kind of patience is fasting, for it combines all three types of patience. It is patience in obeying Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, and it is patience in refraining from disobeying Him, because a person gives up his desires for the sake of Allaah even though his self may be longing for them. Hence it says in the saheeh hadeeth that Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says: “All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except fasting. It is for Me and I shall reward for it, because he gives up his desire and his food and drink for My sake.” Fasting also involves patience in accepting the consequences which may result in hunger and thirst for the fasting person. End quote. Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (p. 219). Whoever manages to fast as Allaah has prescribed will attain a great reward from his Lord, may He be blessed and exalted. It is sufficient for him to know that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning” [al-Zumar 39:10] Thirdly: In order for the Muslim to protect his fasting from being deficient due to committing sins, he must achieve patience in refraining from sin. One of the scholars said that patience in refraining from sin is greater than the other two types of patience. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Here there is an issue which people debated about: which type of patience is better – patience in refraining from sin or patience in obeying Allaah? One group of people suggested that the former is better, and they said that patience in refraining from sin is the attitude of the siddeeqeen, as some of the salaf said: Good deeds are done by righteous and immoral alike, but no one has the power to refrain from sin except a Siddeeq, and because the motive to commit sin is greater than the motive to stop being obedient, because the motive to commit sin is pleasure, but the motive to stop being obedient is laziness and sloth, and undoubtedly the motive to commit sin is stronger. They said: Sin may be promoted by one's own self, whims and desires, the shaytaan, worldly reasons, a man’s companions, a desire to imitate, and natural inclinations. Any one of these factors may cause a person to commit sin, so how about if they are combined and prevail over the heart? What patience can be stronger than patience in refusing to respond to them? If Allaah did not give him patience, he would not be patient by himself. This argument, as you can see, is very strong and very clear. End quote. Tareeq al-Hijratayn (p. 414). Patience in refraining from sin stems from a number of things which we hope you will ponder, for that contains a description of the disease and a prescription of the remedy. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The principle of patience in refraining from sin is based on a number of things: 1 – Knowledge of how reprehensible and vile it is, and that Allaah has only forbidden it as a protection against its evil, just as a caring father will protect his child from things that will harm him. This reason will make the wise person refrain from it, even if he does not pay attention to the warning of punishment. 2 – Feeling shy before Allaah, may He be glorified. If a person realizes that Allaah is watching him and can see him and hear him, he will feel too shy before his Lord to expose himself to His wrath. 3 – Remembering the blessings He has given you and His kindness towards you. Sins inevitably take away blessings. No person commits a sin but one of the blessings of Allaah is taken away because of that sin. If he repents, then it is restored, but if he persists in it, it is not given back to him, and the sins continue to take away blessings until the blessings disappear altogether. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allaah will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allaah)” [???] [al-Ra’d 13:11] The greatest of blessings is faith, but the sins of zina, stealing, drinking alcohol and robbery take them away and cause them to disappear. One of the salaf said: I committed a sin and I was deprived of praying qiyaam for a year. Another said: I committed a sin and I was deprived of understanding of the Qur’aan. Concerning such things it was said: If you have been blessed then take care of it, for sin takes away blessings. To sum up: Sin is a fire that consumes blessings, just as fire consumes wood, Allaah forbid that His blessings be lost. 4 – Fear of Allaah and of His punishment. This may be established by believing in His promises and warnings, and by believing in Him, His Books and His Messengers. This is strengthened by means of knowledge and certain faith, and it is weakened if those two things are weakened, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah” [Faatir 35:28] One of the salaf said: Fear of Allaah is a sign of knowledge and taking Allaah’s forgiveness for granted is a sign of ignorance. 5 – Love of Allaah. This is the strongest factor in being patient in refraining from disobeying Him. The one who loves will be obedient to the one whom he loves. The stronger that love grows in his heart, the more his willingness to obey Him and his unwillingness to disobey Him will grow. Sin and disobedience stem from weakness of love. There is a difference between one who is motivated to avoid disobeying his master because of his fear of his whip and punishment, and one who is motivated to avoid that because of his love for his master. 6 – Nobility and purity of heart. If a person has self-respect and is keen to attain virtue, he will refrain from anything that may lead to doom and dishonour. 7 – Certain knowledge of the consequences of disobedience and the harm that may result from it, such as blackening of the face, darkness in the heart, distress, grief, pain, depression, anxiety, lack of focus, weakness in the face of one’s enemy, confusion, sense of abandonment, being overpowered by one’s enemy, failing to benefit from knowledge, forgetting what one has already learned, and sickness that will surely lead to death if it takes hold, because sins deaden the heart. To sum up: the awful effects of sin are too many for a person to grasp, and the good effects of obedience are too many for a person to grasp. The best of this world and the Hereafter may be attained by obeying Allaah, and the worst of this world and the Hereafter comes from disobeying Him. Concerning some of these effects Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Who could ever obey Me and be doomed because of it and who could ever disobey Me and attain blessings because of it?” 8 – Lack of worldly hope and certainty that he will soon depart this world, and the realization that he is like a traveller who enters a town determined to leave it, or like a rider who rests in the shade of a tree then moves on and leaves it. Because he knows how short his stay will be and how quickly he will move on, he is keen to leave behind anything that may weigh him down or cause him harm and bring no benefit. He is keen to move on with the best that he has. A person has nothing better than a lack of worldly ambition and nothing more harmful than procrastinating and focusing on worldly ambitions. 9 – Avoiding excess in his food, drink, clothing, sleeping, and meeting people, because the temptation to commit sin grows stronger if there is any excess in these areas, because that requires an outlet and what is permissible becomes no longer enough and one begins to transgress into haraam areas. One of the most harmful things for a person is idleness and free time, because the soul is never idle; if it is not kept busy with beneficial things it will inevitably occupy itself with harmful things. 10 – This sums up all the previous things: it is faith that is firmly-rooted in the heart. Patience in refraining from sin depends on strength of faith. The stronger a person’s faith is, the more patient he will be, but if his faith is weak his patience will be weak too. If a person’s heart is filled with the belief that Allaah is watching him and can see him, and has forbidden what He has forbidden to him and will be angry with the one who does it and punish him, and if his heart is filled with the belief in the reward and punishment, Paradise and Hell, then he will not fail to act upon this knowledge. Whoever thinks that he can give up sin without firm and deeply-rooted faith is mistaken. If the lamp of faith is strong in the heart it will illuminate all of its corners and shine its light into its depths; that light will then spread throughout his body and he will respond quickly to the promptings of faith, and will obey humbly and willingly, with no resentment. Rather he will rejoice in this call when it comes, just as a man rejoices in the call of his beloved who calls him to show him kindness and honour him, so he is waiting for his call all the time. Allaah bestows His mercy upon whomsoever He will ... End quote. Tareeq al-Hijratayn (p. 408-414). What is required of the Muslim is to understand what Allaah really wants from his fasting, and to understand what pushes him to commit sin, so that he may keep away from it and shun it and hate it. What we have quoted from Ibn al-Qayyim explains this in the best way. See also the answer to question no. 12468. And Allaah knows best."
186,Those who follow madhhabs and refuse to learn,"Question What should we say to those people who continuously follow Mazhab and who say that :""we are too weak to follow Daleels, only scholars can follow Daleels as they know them very well""... What should be our response to these people who are learning the DEEN but through Mazhab glasses...","Praise be to Allah.The regular Muslim who cannot access the proofs (daleels) or understand them in the way that scholars do is obliged to consult and follow the scholars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you do not know” [al-Nahl 16:43] But in the case of those who can arrive at the correct view on a matter by examining the evidence, it is not permissible for them to follow, unless they do not have the time to research the matter. In that case, they come under the same ruling as a regular Muslim who does not have enough knowledge. -Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareemal-Khudayr There is nothing wrong with learning fiqh according to one of the four madhhabs, on condition that one follows the daleel (evidence) if it becomes apparent that the madhhab says something contrary to the daleel on a given matter, because obedience to Allaah and His Messenger comes before obedience to anyone else. It is also essential to have good manners towards other schools of thought and not to develop sectarian attitudes in opposing them. He should make the truth his aim and respect the opinions and efforts (ijtihaad) of the scholars. He should make discussing matters with them in a polite manner his method of reaching the truth, and he should advise people in a polite way if he thinks that they are mistaken. It is wrong for a person who is able to learn to refuse to do so on the grounds that only the scholars are able to understand the daleel. We do not say to one who is unable to engage in ijtihaad that he has to strive to derive rulings from the texts when he does not have the ability to do that and does not understand the principles; otherwise chaos would reign. But we do say that if you have some knowledge and understanding, you should at least know what the proof and daleel of your imaam (whom you are following) is, so that you can see the connection with the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and you can follow with some measure of insight and not be merely a bind follower. And Allaah is the Source of strength and the Guide to the Straight Path."
187,"Selling a mobile phone for which the purchaser pays in installments, from which the vendor pays for the “smart card”","Question There are some companies which sell mobile phones in the following way:The two parties agree that the company will sell the individual a mobile phone, and will obtain a “smart card” from the telecommunications company, all for a total price of 5000 riyaals, of which the vendor will pay 3000 riyaals to the communications company in return for a “smart card” in the name of the purchaser. One thousand riyaals covers the price of the phone itself. The total figure is to be paid in monthly installments.Is it permissible for the company to sell in installments before they bring the card to the purchaser, knowing that they do not actually own the card?","Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows: It seems that this is not permissible, because the purchaser is telling the vendor, Lend me the cost of the “smart card”, then I will pay you back with something extra. This extra amount is ribaa (usury/ interest). But it is permissible to sell the phone on its own by installments, because the vendor actually owns it. Question: what if he says, Give me the extra amount for the phone? Answer: it does not work this way, because the extra amount is being paid for the whole package. This is haraam, and he should buy the “smart card” with his own money (i.e., the purchaser). Question: does this come under the heading of two contracts in one? Could the relationship between the purchaser and the vendor (with regard to the “smart card”) be that of delegating someone to do something and paying him for his services? Answer: No, because every contract should be dealt with individually. The first contract is with the telecommunications company and the second is with the company (which is selling the phone) – and this is not permissible. It is as if they are giving him (the purchaser) a loan, which they then give to the telecommunications company, then they are asking for extra repayment. And Allaah knows best."
188,Images of the blessings of the grave,Question Who are pious what happens to them in their grave?.,"Praise be to Allah.The evidence indicates that the believer will be blessed in his grave until the Hour begins, then he will move by the grace and mercy of Allaah to the blessings that will never cease or come to an end, which is the blessing of Paradise. May Allaah make us among its people. These are some of the images of the blessings which are bestowed upon the believer in his grave: 1-His grave is furnished from Paradise for him 2-He is clothed in garments from Paradise. 3-A gate to Paradise is opened for him, and its breezes come to him, and he smells its fragrance and he feels delight in what he can see of its blessings. 4-His grave is made wide and spacious for him. 5-He is given the glad tidings of Allaah’s pleasure and Paradise. Hence he longs for the Hour to begin. It was narrated that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib said: “We went out with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for the funeral of a man from among the Ansaar. We came to the grave and when (the deceased) was placed in the lahd, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat down and we sat around him, as if there were birds on our heads (i.e., quiet and still). In his hand he had a stick with which he was scratching the ground. Then he raised his head and said, “Seek refuge with Allaah from the torment of the grave”, two or three times. Then he said, “When the believing slave is about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to him from heaven angels with white faces like the sun, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see. They bring with them shrouds from Paradise and perfumes from Paradise. Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O good soul, come forth to forgiveness from Allaah and His pleasure.’ Then it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a waterskin. When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant before they take it and put it in that shroud with that perfume, and there comes from it a fragrance like the finest musk on the face of the earth. Then they ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is this good soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and so the son of So and so, calling him by the best names by which he was known in this world, until they reach the lowest heaven. They ask for it to be opened to them and it is opened, and (the soul) is welcomed and accompanied to the next heaven by those who are closest to Allaah, until they reach the seventh heaven. Then Allaah says: ‘Record the book of My slave in ‘Illiyoon in the seventh heaven, and return him to the earth, for from it I created them, to it I will return them and from it I will bring them forth once again.’ So his soul is returned to his body and there come to him two angels who make him sit up and they say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He says, ‘Allaah.’ They say, ‘What is your religion?’ He says, ‘My religion is Islam.’ They say, ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?’ He says, ‘He is the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ They say, ‘What did you do?’ He says, ‘I read the Book of Allaah and I believed in it.’ Then a voice calls out from heaven, ‘My slave has spoken the truth, so prepare for him a bed from Paradise and clothe him from Paradise, and open for him a gate to Paradise.’ Then there comes to him some of its fragrance, and his grave is made wide, as far as he can see. Then there comes to him a man with a handsome face and handsome clothes, and a good fragrance, who says, ‘Receive the glad tidings that will bring you joy this day.’ He says, ‘Who are you? Your face is a face which brings glad tidings.’ He says, ‘I am your righteous deeds.’ He says, ‘O Lord, hasten the Hour so that I may return to my family and my wealth.’…” Narrated by Ahmad, 17803; Abu Dawood, 4753. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 156 6-He will be happy when he sees what would have been his place in Hell, which Allaah has replaced for him with a place in Paradise. Ahmad (10577) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: I attended a funeral with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O people, this ummah will be tested in their graves. When a man is buried and his friends leave him, an angel with a hammer in his hand comes and sits by him and asks, ‘What do you say about this man?’ If he is a believer, he says, ‘I bear witness that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.’ He says, ‘You have spoken the truth.’ Then a door to Hell is opened for him and he says, ‘This would have been your place if you had disbelieved in your Lord, but because you believed, this is your place.’ Then a door to Paradise is opened for him and he wants to go there, but the angel says to him, ‘Calm down,’ and his grave is made wide and spacious for him. But if he is a kaafir or a hypocrite, (the angel) says to him, ‘What do you say about this man?’ He says, ‘I do not know, I heard the people saying something.’ The angel says, ‘You did not know and you did not follow those who knew and you were not guided.’ Then a door to Paradise is opened for him and he says, ‘This would have been your position if you had believed in your Lord. But because you disbelieved, Allaah has replaced it for you with this.’ Then a gate to Hell is opened for him, and he strikes him a blow with the hammer which is heard by all of Allaah’s creation apart from the two races (of mankind and the jinn).” Some of the people said, “O Messenger of Allaah, there is no one who would have an angel standing by him holding a hammer but he would dumbfounded.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm.” [Ibraaheem 14:27 – interpretation of the meaning] Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in his commentary on Kitaab al-Sunnah by Ibn Abi ‘Aasim, 865 7-He will sleep the sleep of a bridegroom 8-His grave will be illuminated for him It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the deceased (or he said: any one of you) is buried, two black and blue angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer come to him. They say, ‘What did you say about this man?’ And he says what he used to say, that he is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger, ‘I bear witness that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.’ They say, ‘We knew that you would say this.’ Then his grave is expanded, seventy cubits wide, and it is filled with light. He says, ‘Let me go back to my family and tell them.’ They say, ‘Sleep like a bridegroom whom no one will wake but his most beloved,’ until Allaah raises him up. But if he was a hypocrite he says, ‘I heard the people saying something and I said likewise, I do not know.’ So they say, ‘We knew that you would say that.’ Then it is said to the earth, ‘Squeeze him,’ so it squeezes him until his ribs interlock. And he will remain like that, being tormented, until Allaah raises him up.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1071. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1391. With regard to his sleep being likened to the sleep of a bridegroom, that is because he will be so happy and comfortable. Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. These are some of the blessings that the believer will enjoy in his grave. We ask Allaah to make us among His people. And Allaah knows best."
189,Stating one price for a product if paid for in cash and another price if paid for in installments,"Question Is it permissible to state one price for a product if the purchaser is going to pay for it in cash, and another price if the purchaser is going to pay for it in installments? For example, this car costs fifty thousand in cash and sixty thousand by installments?.","Praise be to Allah.If the vendor says: this car costs fifty thousand if paid for in cash and sixty thousand if paid for in installments, one of two scenarios must apply: 1 – The seller and purchaser part having agreed on one price and method of payment. In this case the transaction is valid. 2 – If they separate without having agreed on the price. This transaction is haraam and is not valid. Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh al-Sunnah – concerning this second type of transaction – This is invalid according to the majority of scholars, because it is not known which of them has stated the price. This is how many of the scholars interpreted the Prophet’s prohibition on doing two transactions in one. Al-Tirmidhi (1152) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade two transactions in one. This was classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 985. Al-Tirmidhi said: this is what the scholars based their views on. Some scholars interpreted it by saying that two transactions in one means that the seller says, “I will sell you this garment for ten in cash or for twenty in installments, but when they part they have not agreed on either of the transactions. If they part having agreed on one of them, there is nothing wrong with that, if the contract is based on one of them. Al-Nasaa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Two transactions in one means that a person says, “I will sell you this product for one hundred dirhams in cash or for two hundred dirhams in installments.” Al-Shawkaani said in Nayl al-Awtaar: The reason why two transactions in one is forbidden is that the price is not fixed because one thing is sold for two prices. The Standing Committee was asked: What is your opinion about selling a car of ten thousand in cash or twelve thousand in installments? They replied: If a person sells a car to another for ten thousand riyals, for example, if he pays cash, or for twelve thousand riyals if payment is deferred, and they part after the transaction is made without having agreed on either of the two options – the cash price or the price for delayed payment – this transaction is not permissible and it is not valid, because of the ambiguity concerning the final transaction and whether the price is to be paid now or later. This is how many of the scholars have understood the Prophet’s prohibition on making two transactions in one. This was narrated by Ahmad, al-Nasaa’i and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as saheeh by the latter. But if they agree before they separate upon the price and one of the methods of payment, either the price in cash or the price if payment is deferred, and they separate having agreed upon the specific details, then the transaction is permissible and is valid because the price and conditions are known.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/192 ) In another question: If the vendor says, “This product costs ten riyals if payment is deferred and five riyals if paid in cash, what is the ruling on that? The Committee replied: If the situation is as you described, then the transaction is not permissible, because it is a kind of two transactions in one. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade two transactions in one, because that involves ambiguity that may lead to conflicts and disputes.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah, 13/197) Among the decisions of the Fiqh Council is the following: It is permissible to increase the price for deferred payment as opposed to immediate payment. It is also permissible to state the price if paid in cash and another price if payment is made in installments at known times. But the transaction is not valid unless the two parties decide as to whether this is to be paid in cash or paid later. If there is some confusion as to whether the payment is to be in cash or paid later, then there is no firm agreement on one particular price, so this is not permissible according to sharee‘ah. And Allah knows best."
190,He divorced his wife when she was in nifaas (post-partum bleeding) when she insisted on divorce,"Question A few years ago there was an argument between me and my wife, and I uttered the word of divorce (talaaq). I was very angry and was not aware of what I was saying in the heat of argument. One of the shaykhs told me that this did not count as a divorce because of my state at that time. Last month my wife gave birth and she was in nifaas, and we had an argument. She locked the door and hid the key so that I could not go out and solve the problem, which made me angrier. During the argument I said to her, “you want to live on your own,” meaning that I was divorcing her. The argument got worse and I said to her, “actually you want to get divorced and live on your own.” She said: “Divorce me so that I could be free from the hell I am in.” So I divorced her. Please note that I tried to take the key so that I could get out of the house, and I also said to her, “I will divorce you after the nifaas,” trying to calm things down so that I could go out and let things settle down. But she insisted on divorce at that moment and I said to her: “You are divorced.” After that, we talked about what had happened and she said: “I swear by Almighty Allah that I did not ask for divorce and I never meant that.” My question is: Did this count as divorce? If it did, is it regarded as the first or second talaaq? What is her ‘iddah? When can I take her back? Because she is still in ‘iddah and is not pure at present. Can I stipulate my conditions verbally, so that I could take her back and so that she will not go back to some of the problems that she did? Please note that one of the shaykhs gave a fatwa stating that this does count as a divorce and that it is haraam during nifaas.","Praise be to Allah. The divorce (talaaq) that is prescribed in sharee‘ah is when the husband divorces his wife during the period of purity in which he has not had intercourse with her. If he divorces her during her menses or when she was bleeding following childbirth (nifaas), this is an innovated divorce (talaaq bid‘i). The fuqaha’ differed concerning the innovated divorce. The majority of them are of the view that it does count as such, but some are of the view that it does not count, because it is an innovated and haraam divorce, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods)” [al-Talaaq 65:1]. What is meant is when they are in a state of purity and the husband has not had intercourse with them (during that period of purity). Among those who were of this opinion was Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), and he was followed by a number of scholars. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (20/58): There are different types of innovated divorce, such as: when a man divorces his wife when she is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, or during the period of purity in which he has been intimate with her. The correct view is that this does not count as divorce. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Because Allah has prescribed that a woman should be divorced during a state of purity following nifaas or menses, at a time when her husband has not had intercourse with her. This is the divorce (talaaq) that is acceptable in sharee‘ah. So if he divorces her during her menses or nifaas, or during a period of purity in which he has had intercourse with her, this is an innovated divorce and does not count as such according to the correct scholarly opinion, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods)” [al-Talaaq 65:1]. What is meant is when they are in a state of purity and the husband has not had intercourse with them. This is what the scholars said about divorcing them at the prescribed period: they should be in a state of purity following menses or nifaas when the husband has not had intercourse with them, or else they should be pregnant. This is what is meant by divorcing women in their prescribed periods. End quote from Fataawa al-Talaaq, p. 44 See also: Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (21/286) Based on that, the divorce that you issued when your wife was in nifaas did not count as such. See also the answer to question no. 110488. And Allah knows best."
191,Does the disbeliever have to shave his head if he becomes Muslim?,Question Is it prescribed for the disbeliever to shave his head if he becomes Muslim? Is that obligatory or recommended? Is the same thing prescribed for the apostate if he comes back to Islam? What should he do if his hair is already short?,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: It is narrated in a number of hadiths that the disbeliever is to be instructed to shave his head if he becomes Muslim, but none of these hadiths are saheeh. Imam ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq as-San‘aani said in his Musannaf (10/317): Ibn Jurayj told us: I was informed, from ‘Uthaym ibn Kulayb, from his father, from his grandfather, that he came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: I have become Muslim, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shave off the hair of disbelief.” It was narrated via ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (15432) and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (356). This isnaad is da‘eef jiddan (very weak), because it includes three unknown narrators: the Shaykh of Ibn Jurayj, who is not named in the isnaad, ‘Uthaym ibn Katheer and his grandfather Katheer ibn Kulayb. In fact it was said that the shaykh of Ibn Jurayj in this isnaad is Ibraaheem ibn Abi Yahya, whose hadith is to be rejected and who was subject to criticism by the majority of muhadditheen. Please see: al-Jarh wa’t-Ta‘deel (2/125) and Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (1/158) Ibn al-Qayyim said: With regard to this Ibraaheem, there was consensus among the hadith scholars that he is weak – apart from ash-Shaafa‘i only. End quote from Tuhfat al-Mawdood (p. 170) Ibn ‘Adiyy said: What Ibn Jurayj said in this isnaad, “I was informed, from ‘Uthaym ibn Kulayb” means that Ibraaheem ibn Abi Yahya is the one who narrated it to him, and he mentioned him by his kunyah, not his full name. End quote from al-Kaamil fi Du‘afa’ ar-Rijaal (1/361) Ibn Taahir al-Maqdisi said: The man whom he mentioned by his kunyah is this Ibraaheem, who is da‘eef jiddan (very weak), and he narrated it from ‘Uthaym ibn Katheer ibn Kulayb. End quote from Dhakheerat al-Huffaaz (1/457) Ibn al-Qattaan said: Its isnaad is extremely weak, in addition to the interruption indicated by the words of Ibn Jurayj, “I was informed.” That is because ‘Uthaym ibn Kulayb and his father and grandfather are majhool (unknown). Would that the matter stopped there, but there are further reservations about this hadith because some of the hadith scholars said: With regard to Ibn Jurayj, who said “I was informed from ‘Uthaym ibn Kulayb”, it was only narrated to him from ‘Uthaym ibn Kulayb by Ibraaheem ibn Abi Yahya, who is known to be da‘eef, and there were other concerns regarding his religious commitment. End quote from Bayaan al-Wahm wa’l-Eehaam (3/43). The commentators on Musnad al-Imam Ahmad said: ‘Uthaym ibn Kulayb was named after his grandfather, whose full name was ‘Uthaym ibn Katheer ibn Kulayb al-Hadrami. Many people narrated from him, and he was mentioned by Ibn Hibbaan in ath-Thiqaat. Adh-Dhahabi said in al-Kaashif: He was trustworthy. Al-Haafiz said in at-Taqreeb: He is majhool (unknown). We have not come across any biographical details of his father, but the rest of its men are thiqaat (trustworthy). End quote. There is corroborating evidence for this hadith in the hadith of Waathilah ibn al-Asqa‘, which was narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu‘jam as-Sagheer (2/117) and al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer (199) via Mansoor ibn ‘Ammaar: My father told us: Ma‘roof Abu’l-Khattaab told us: from Waathilah ibn al-Asqa‘: When I became Muslim, I came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said to me: “Do ghusl with water and lotus leaves, and shave off the hair of kufr (disbelief).” At-Tabaraani said: Nothing was narrated from Waathilah ibn al-Asqa‘ except via this isnaad, which was narrated only by Mansoor ibn ‘Ammaar. End quote. Al-Haythami said: Its isnaad includes Mansoor ibn ‘Ammaar the preacher, who is da‘eef (weak). End quote from Majma‘ az-Zawaa’id (1/283) This report was also classed as da‘eef by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (2/168) There is a second corroborating report that was narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu‘jam al-Kabeer (19/14) via Qataadah ibn al-Fadl ibn Qataadah ar-Rahaawi, from his father: the paternal uncle of my father, Haashim ibn Qataadah ar-Rahaawi, told me, that his father said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and became Muslim. He said to me: “O Qataadah, do ghusl with water and lotus leaves, and shave off the hair of kufr (disbelief).” Al-Haythami said: It was narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy). End quote from Majma‘ az-Zawaa’id (1/283( It was classed as da‘eef by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in at-Talkhees (2/168) Shaykh al-Albaani said: It is clear to me that al-Haafiz was correct in classing its isnaad as da‘eef, and that his shaykh al-Haythami was mistaken in classing its men as trustworthy, because in doing that he relied on Ibn Hibbaan, who narrated all of that from Haashim ibn Qataadah ar-Rahaawi and al-Fadl ibn Qataadah ar-Rahaawi in his book ath-Thiqaat (5/503 and 7/317). It is well known that Ibn Hibbaan was lenient in classing narrators as trustworthy, especially when these two men are only known in this isnaad. End quote from Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (6/1181). However, Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that this hadith is hasan, based on these corroborating reports. But what appears to be the case is that the view of al-Haafiz ibn Hajar and other scholars, that this hadith is to be classed as da‘eef, is more likely to be correct, as its isnaads are not free of weakness and cannot be strengthened. Among the prominent scholars who classed this hadith as da‘eef are: Ibn Taahir al-Maqdisi, in Dhakheerat al-Huffaaz (1/457) An-Nawawi in al-Majmoo‘ (2/154) Ibn Daqeeq al-Eid in al-Imam (1/417) Adh-Dhahabi in Tanqeeh at-Tahqeeq (2/264) Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer in Irshaad al-Faqeeh (1/34) Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in at-Talkhees (2/168) As-Suyooti in al-Jaami‘ as-Sagheer (1580) Al-Mubaarakfoori in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (2/529) Ash-Shawkaani in al-Fath ar-Rabbaani (9/4507) Secondly: The majority of scholars regard it as mustahabb for the disbeliever, when he becomes Muslim, to shave his head. See: al-Mawsoo‘ah at-Fiqhiyyah (18/101) As-Sindi said: They interpreted this command as meaning that it is mustahabb (recommended) and said: It is recommended, when the disbeliever becomes a Muslim, to remove his hair by shaving or cutting it, but shaving it is preferable. End quote from Haashiyat Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (8/292) An-Nawawi said: It is recommended for the disbeliever, when he becomes Muslim, to shave off the hair of his head. This was stated by ash-Shaafa‘i in al-Umm. End quote from al-Majmoo‘ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (2/154) In fact some of them said that it is recommended to shave off all hair on the head and body, except the beard. In Haashiyat al-Bujayrami ‘ala al-Khateeb (1/253) it says: It is Sunnah for him also to remove all hair from his body, including the head and otherwise, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood: “Remove the hair of disbelief” – except the beard of the male. End quote. Ibn Qudaamah said: It is recommended for him to remove his hair, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed a man who became Muslim: “Shave your hair…” At the very least, this command indicates that it is recommended (mustahabb). End quote from al-Mughni (1/153) In Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/153) it says: It is Sunnah to remove his hair, so the head should be shaved, if he is a man, and the pubic hair and armpit hair should be removed in all cases. End quote. Some of the scholars are of the view that what is meant in this hadith – assuming that it is saheeh – is shaving off hair in cases where it is worn in a style that is unique to the disbelievers; hence it is called in the report “the hair of disbelief”. Al-Qarraafi said: What it refers to is that which is a style that is symbolic of disbelief; otherwise the people used to enter the religion of Allah in crowds without shaving their heads. End quote from adh-Dhakeerah (1/305) Al-Mubaarakfoori said: What is meant by the hair of disbelief is hair worn in a style that was a sign of disbelief for the disbelievers. Such styles vary from one land to another. The disbelievers of India and Egypt had a spot on the head where the hair would grow long and they would never cut it or shave it; if they wanted to shave their head, they would shave all of it except that spot. End quote from Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (3/183) It says in ‘Awn al-Ma‘bood (2/15): It does not mean – and Allah knows best – that everyone who becomes Muslim should shave his head, in the sense that shaving the head is required just as ghusl is required. Rather the fact that the hair is mentioned in conjunction with disbelief (“the hair of disbelief”) indicates that the hair should be shaved off if it is worn in a style that is a sign of disbelief for the disbelievers… According to the apparent meaning, this refers to a sign that distinguishes between disbelief and Islam. End quote. Ash-Shawkaani said: There is no report to suggest that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed anyone who became Muslim, among the senior Sahaabah, to shave off his hair, or that he issued such instructions to any of those who became Muslim later on, apart from this man. Nevertheless, the hadith mentioned which speaks of shaving the head is da‘eef, as the scholars have explained. End quote from al-Fath ar-Rabbaani (9/4507) With regard to the apostate, we have not come across any scholar who stated that it is recommended for him to shave off his hair if he becomes Muslim again. We have not come across anything in the reports either to suggest that if the apostate becomes Muslim again, he is to be instructed to shave off his hair. What appears to be the case is that he is different from the one who was originally a disbeliever, despite what we have mentioned about the difference of opinion concerning the one who was originally a disbeliever. Perhaps if it is said that if an apostate remains an apostate for a long time, during which his hair grows and can be described as being the hair of disbelief, or his hair is worn in a style that is a symbol of disbelief, as is mentioned with regard to the symbols of the disbeliever – if it is said that in such a case he should be instructed to shave off his hair, like the one who was originally a disbeliever, and unlike the one whose case is not like that, who has been an apostate for only a short time – perhaps if we say this, there may be some validity in this point of view, in sha Allah. Al-‘Ayni said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) only issued instructions to shave off excess hair in order to clean it and remove the hair that grew during the time of disbelief. End quote from Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood (2/183) Conclusion: There is no saheeh report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to suggest that the one who becomes Muslim should be instructed to shave his head. The hadiths that speak of that are not free of weakness, even though some later scholars classed them as hasan. The majority of scholars regard it as recommended for the one who becomes Muslim to shave his head, and some of them are of the view that this ruling only applies to the one whose hair is worn in a style that is exclusive to the disbelievers. In this case – only – he is to be instructed to shave it off. This view is most likely to be correct. For more information, please see the answer to question no. 14051. And Allah knows best."
192,"He sold land to someone for a deferred payment, and that person sold it for a higher price; can the transaction be cancelled because of the loss?","Question We sold a land to one person. The amount decided was Rs. 400000. We agreed that we will give the land to him. The complete payment duration was fixed over several months. The land is still on our name and it will not be registered on his name until he makes the full payment. However, the man sold a part of the land to someone else at a higher rate. He has done partial payment of Rs. 100000 to us till now. 1) Is it permissible on the part of that man to sell the land to someone else at higher rate even though the land is still on our name and full payment has not been made? 2) Seeing some loss we want to cancel this transaction and sell it to someone else. We will return him the Rs 100000 that he payed us. Is it permissible for us to do that even though we agreed initially that we will give the land to him?.","Praise be to Allah. If the sale has been completed and the purchaser has taken possession of the land, it is permissible for him to sell it for the same price or for more or less, because it has now become his property that he may dispose of however he wishes, by giving it away, selling it, renting it out or otherwise. The fact that it has not been registered in his name does not matter, because registration is only for the purpose of documentation. It also does not matter that he had not paid off the balance, because by means of the transaction it became his lawful property and he is to be asked to pay off what he owes, unless you had stipulated that he should not sell it until he had paid off the outstanding balance, or if the reason for not registering it was so that he would not be able to sell it until he had paid it off. This is a permissible condition and means that the land is being held in pledge until the price is paid in full, and he has to adhere to the condition and it is not valid for him to sell it to a third party before that. But if you did not stipulate that he should not sell it, there are no grounds for not allowing him to do so, because he may dispose of his property. You do not have the right to try to cancel the transaction out of jealousy of the profit that he made by selling it, unless you were deceived concerning the price for which you sold it, in which case you have the right to cancel the transaction or go ahead with it. According to some fuqaha’, this is called khiyaar al-ghabn (option of cancelling the deal in the event of gross and unfair underselling) There are several forms of khiyaar al-ghabn, such as: bay‘ al-mustarsil, which refers to one who does not know the value of things or is not good at bargaining, so he may buy or sell something for far more or less than it is worth according to people of experience. In that case he has the choice. But if he knew the value of things and he is good at bargaining, then this is not applicable. If the option of khiyaar al-ghabn is not applicable in your case, you cannot cancel the transaction, because the sale is a binding contract unless he lets you off and agrees to cancel it. If you stipulated that he should not sell it until he had paid off the price, then he is obliged to adhere to that and is not allowed to sell it until he has paid it off. But you do not have the right to cancel the transaction with him except with his consent, because of what is stated above about the transaction being a binding contract. And Allah knows best."
193,Ruling on fishing with spears and hand grenades,"Question What is the sunnah way of fishing? Do we have to say takbeer before taking the fish out of water or when we cut it, like we do when slaughtering halaal animals? And lastly some people kill the fish while it is in the water to catch it for example by using a spear, throwing/striking a stone or even using hand gernades to kill loads of fish so that they can catch them easily. Are these methods correct?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is no Sunnah to be followed with regard to fishing, and fish do not come under the heading of animals which must be slaughtered in a specific manner, or over which the name of Allah must be mentioned at the time of slaughter. But if one says the name of Allah before catching them, that is good and there is nothing wrong with it, as it is encouraged to mention the name of Allah over anything that is of any importance to a person. But there is no specific Sunnah concerning it, and it is not regarded as something that is to be slaughtered in a special manner, as mentioned above, because fishing is not subject to the same regulations that are prescribed with regard to slaughter and hunting land animals, such as saying Bismillah and takbeer. That is because the scholars are unanimously agreed that creatures that live only in water, such as fish and the like, are permissible without being slaughtered in a specific manner. Secondly: Fishing with spears and the like is permissible, if it is not possible to catch them in other ways, such as with nets and so on, such as if the fish is big and can only be caught with a spear and so on. So the basic principle is that fishing with a spear is permissible. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Allah will certainly make a trial of you with something in (the matter of) the game that is well within reach of your hands and your lances” [al-Maa’idah 5:94]. But the fisherman must pay attention to kindness in catching the fish, and try to choose the gentlest possible method of catching them, and the least likely to torment or cause undue hardship to whatever he catches; he should also avoid doing anything harmful to himself or others. It was narrated from Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things, so if you kill, kill well, and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let one of you sharpen his blade and spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.” Narrated by Muslim (1955) The basic principle with regard to preventing anything that may cause harm to oneself or others is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (2340); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah For more information, please see also the answer to question no. 178869. And Allah knows best."
194,Events that will occur before the Day of Resurrection and distinguish the believers from the kaafirs,Question What are the tests or trials that may occur before the last day of Judgement which will help distinguish between the Muslims and Kaafirs?.,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us of signs that will take place before the Hour begins, which the scholars have categorized as “lesser signs” and “greater signs”. Some of them designated a third category, “intermediate signs”, namely the emergence of the Mahdi. This is one of the minor signs, but during his time some of the major signs will appear. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us of some of the things that will distinguish the believers from the kaafirs before the Day of Resurrection. These include: (a) The emergence of the Beast. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast for them, to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat (Verses of the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad)” [al-Naml 27:82] Ibn Katheer said: This Beast will emerge at the end of time, when people have become corrupt and forsaken the commands of Allaah, and altered the true religion. Then Allaah will bring forth to them a Beast from the earth.” Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/375. It was narrated from Abu Umaamah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Beast will emerge and strike the people on their noses, then their numbers [i.e., those who have been marked on the nose] will increase among you until a man will buy a camel, and they will say, ‘Who did you buy it from?’ and he will say, ‘I bought it from one of those with a mark on their noses.’” Narrated by Ahmad, 21805. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 322. What is meant by striking the people on their noses is that it will make marks on their noses, and there will be one mark for believers and another for kaafirs. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three things which, when they emerge, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his Faith [cf. al-An’aam 6:158]: the sun rising from the west, the Dajjaal and the Beast of the earth.” Narrated by Muslim, 158. (b) The followers of the Dajjaal when he emerges. It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Seventy thousand of the Jews of Isbahaan wearing large cloaks will follow the Dajjaal.” (c) Madeenah will be cleansed of kaafirs and hypocrites at the time of the Dajjaal. It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no city that the Dajjaal will not enter, except Makkah and Madeenah. He will not approach any of their alleyways but there will be angels standing guarding it. Then Madeenah will be shaken with its people three times, and Allaah will bring forth every kaafir and hypocrite.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1782; Muslim, 2943. (d) A wind blowing from the direction of Yemen It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will send a wind from Yemen, softer than silk, and it will not leave anyone in whose heart is faith the weight of a grain but it will take him (his soul).” Narrated by Muslim, 117. Al-Nawawi said: With regard to the meaning of this hadeeth, there are many similar ahaadeeth, for example: “the Hour will not begin until it is not said on earth, ‘Allaah, Allaah’”; and “It will not come upon anyone who says, ‘Allaah, Allaah’”; and “It will only come upon the most evil of people.” All of these and similar reports mean what they appear to mean. With regard to the other hadeeth, “A group of my ummah will continue to follow the truth [?] until the Day of Resurrection,” this does not contradict the other ahaadeeth, because what this means is that they will continue to adhere to the truth until their are taken by that gentle wind, close to the time of the Hour or when its portents appear. So the mention in this hadeeth of them remaining until the Hour begins is to be understood as referring to when its portents appear and it is about to begin. And Allaah knows best. Sharh Muslim, 2/132. And Allaah knows best."
195,Scholarly consensus (ijmaa‘) as binding proof and the first consensus that occurred in Islam,"Question I would like to know what was the first consensus (ijmaa‘) that happened in the history of Islam, and what is the importance of consensus?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Consensus (ijmaa‘) is one of the important sources of legislation that must be followed. There are several definitions of consensus (ijmaa‘); the favoured view is that of as-Subki (may Allah have mercy on him), who defined it as follows: It is when there is unanimous agreement among the scholars of the ummah after the death of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), during any era, on some particular matter. End quote from Jam‘ al-Jaami‘, annotated by Wali ad-Deen al-‘Iraaqi, which is known also known as al-Ghayth al-Haami‘, p. 485 There is a great deal of definitive evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah for the fact that consensus constitutes binding proof. We have explained some of it previously in the answer to question no. 201682 . For example, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination” [an-Nisa’ 4:115]. Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever goes against it – that is, consensus – after coming to know of it, or after proof has been established on the basis of consensus, is deserving of the warning mentioned in the verse. End quote from Maraatib al-Ijmaa‘ by Ibn Hazm, p. 7. Al-Qaadi Abu Ya‘la (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Consensus constitutes binding proof with which one should comply and it is haraam to go against it; it is not possible for the ummah to agree on error. End quote from al-‘Uddah fi Usool al-Fiqh (4/1058). Secondly: We have not come across anyone who mentioned the first consensus that occurred in Islam, or the first one to narrate such a thing. We have stated above that consensus is when the scholars agree on a particular issue after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). However, during his lifetime (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), consensus did not constitute proof. Al-Aamidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The consensus of those who were alive at the time of revelation did not constitute proof at the time of revelation, according to consensus; rather consensus became binding proof after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). End quote from al-Ahkaam by al-Aamidi (1/109). Based on that, it may be said that the first consensus that occurred after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) on the necessity of appointing a caliph, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Therefore the Muhaajireen and Ansaar met in the saqeefah of Banu Saa‘idah for that purpose, before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was buried, then they agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as caliph. Among the first examples of consensus after that was the agreement of the Sahaabah on fighting the apostates, after some initial objection on the part of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), but then Allah opened his heart and caused him to feel at ease with the decision of Abu Bakr, and the Sahaabah agreed on that, without any dissent. Imam Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, praised the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, and the earliest Muslims; the Qur’an speaks highly of the Muhaajireen and Ansaar in many places, and praises those who were present at Bay‘at ar-Ridwaan [when the Muslims affirmed their allegiance to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) at al-Hudaybiyyah]. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Certainly was Allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree” [al-Fat-h 48:18]. These people whom Allah praised agreed to appoint Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) as their leader; they called him Khaleefat Rasool-Allah (the Successor to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), and swore allegiance to him, rallying behind him and affirming his virtue, for he was the best of the Sahaabah in the qualities that are required for a person to be a leader, such as knowledge, asceticism, wisdom, leadership abilities, and so on. End quote from al-Ibaanah fi Usool ad-Diyaanah, p. 66 And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What confirms the fact that Abu Bakr’s appointment as caliph was based on a strong foundation is the fact that all the Muslims rallied behind him and accepted his leadership.… Later on, we see that ‘Ali and al-‘Abbaas swore allegiance to him and agreed to accept his leadership. Therefore his leadership, after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), was based on the consensus of the Muslims. It is not appropriate for anyone to say that what was in the hearts of ‘Ali and al-‘Abbaas [concerning the appointment of Abu Bakr as caliph] was something other than what they showed. If that argument was valid, then it would be almost impossible to establish consensus. The same argument could be used with regard to any consensus of the Muslims, but that would lead to the invalidation of the idea of consensus as binding proof, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has not obliged us to know what is hidden in people’s minds when it comes to the matter of consensus; rather He has obliged us to go by what people appear to be. Therefore consensus and agreement on the appointment of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq as caliph did indeed occur. End quote from al-Ibaanah, p. 66 Imam Abu ‘Uthmaan as-Saabooni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of hadith confirmed the validity of Abu Bakr’s appointment as caliph after the death of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because he was chosen by the Sahaabah; they were unanimously agreed on that and they all said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was pleased that he should lead us in our religious matters (prayers), therefore we are pleased for him to lead us in our worldly matters. In other words, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed him to lead the people in the obligatory prayers when he was sick, which is their religious affairs, so we accept him as the successor of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) with regard to our worldly affairs. When they said, The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead of us, so how could we put you back? What they meant was: the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put you ahead to lead us in prayer when he was sick, and we prayed behind you on his orders, so how could we put you back after he put you forward? The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke highly of Abu Bakr when he was alive, which indicated to the Sahaabah that he was the most deserving of being appointed caliph after him. Hence they agreed to rally behind him, and that was to their own benefit, and they gained honour and victory through him. End quote from ‘Aqeedat as-Salaf wa As-haab al-Hadith, p. 290. We shall mention here the story of how ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) swore allegiance to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq on the first day. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Haafiz Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi said: Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz al-Isfaraayeeni informed us: Abu ‘Ali al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali al-Haafiz told us: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah and Ibraaheem ibn Abi Taalib told us: Bandaar ibn Bashaar told us: Abu Hishaam al-Makhzoomi told us: Wuhayb told us: Dawood ibn Abi Hind told us: Abu Nadrah told us, from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away and the people, including Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, gathered in the house of Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah. The spokesman of the Ansaar stood up and said: Do you know that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was one of the Muhaajireen, and his successor is one of the Muhaajireen, and we are the Ansaar (helpers) of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we will be the Ansaar (helpers) of his successor as we were his helpers? ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab stood up and said Your spokesman has spoken the truth. If you had said something other than this, we would not have accepted that. And he took the hand of Abu Bakr and said: This is the right man, so swear allegiance to him. ‘Umar swore allegiance to him, and the Muhaajireen and Ansaar swore allegiance to him. Then Abu Bakr ascended the minbar and looked at the people, and he did not see az-Zubayr. So he called for az-Zubayr, and he came. Abu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal aunt of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his disciple; do you want to cause division among the Muslims? He said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him. Then Abu Bakr looked at the people, and he did not see ‘Ali, so he called ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and he came. Abu Bakr said: (You are) the son of the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his son-in-law; do you want to cause division among the Muslims? He said: There is nothing to worry about, O successor of the Messenger of Allah. Then he stood up and swore allegiance to him. Abu ‘Ali al-Haafiz said: I heard Muhammad ibn Is-haaq ibn Khuzaymah say: Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj came to me and asked me about this hadith, so I wrote it down for him on a piece of paper and I read it to him. This hadith is worth a badanah (a valuable camel); indeed it is worth a badrah (sack of money)! End quote from al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer (5/269). A badrah is a big sack full of money; it was said that it is one thousand or ten thousand dirhams, or seven thousand dinars. Al-Mu‘jam al-Waseet (p. 43); al-Qaamoos al-Muheet (p. 444). Then Ibn Katheer narrated a report about another oath of allegiance that ‘Ali swore after the death of Faatimah (ma y Allah be pleased with her). He said: This oath of allegiance that was sworn by ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) to Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) after the death of Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) was in confirmation of the reconciliation between them and it was secondary to the oath of allegiance mentioned above, that was sworn on the day of as-saqeefah, as was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah and classed as saheeh by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj. ‘Ali did not keep his distance from Abu Bakr, during these six months; rather he used to pray behind him, and he was present when Abu Bakr used to meet with some of the senior Sahaabah in order to seek their advice concerning some issues; he was also willing to ride with him on a campaign to Dhu’l-Qassah. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it says that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed ‘Asr a few days after the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, then he went out of the mosque and found al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali playing with some boys. He carried him on his shoulder and started saying: May my father be sacrificed for the one who looks like the Prophet and does not look like ‘Ali! And ‘Ali smiled (at this joke). But when this second oath of allegiance occurred, some narrators thought that ‘Ali had not sworn allegiance (to Abu Bakr) before that, so they denied that (the first oath of allegiance) had happened. But if someone confirms that something happens, that takes precedence over the report of someone who says that it did not happen, as we have mentioned and explained above. And Allah knows best. End quote from al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (5/307) And Allah knows best."
196,Does Vomiting Invalidate Wudu?,Question Does vomiting invalidate wudu?,"Praise be to Allah.Does vomiting break wudu? Some scholars are of the view that vomiting does invalidate wudu, such as Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Ahmad. But Ahmad stipulated that vomiting does invalidate wudu if there is a large amount of vomit. Imam al-Shafi`i was of the view that vomiting does not invalidate wudu, and this is the correct view, because there is no sound evidence to show that vomiting invalidates wudu. (See: al-Majmu’, 2/63-65; al-Mughni, 1/247-250) Does whatever comes out of anything other than the front and back passages break wudu? Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Does whatever comes out of anything other than the invalidate wudu? He replied: “What comes out of anything other than the front and back passages does not invalidate wudu , whether it is a little or a lot, except urine and stools. That is because the basic principle is that it does not invalidate wudu. Whoever claims something that is contrary to the basic principle has to provide evidence, but it is proven that man is tahir by the shar’i evidence, and whatever is proven by the shar’i evidence cannot be altered except by further shar’i evidence. We do not go beyond what is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because we submit to the laws of Allah, not to our whims and desires. So there is no justification for making people purify themselves when it is not essential and we do not waive from them a purification that is obligatory. If someone were to say that it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) vomited then did wudu, we say: this hadith has been classed as da’if by most of the scholars. Then we say that this is simply an action, and the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) simply did an action does not indicate that it is obligatory, because there is no clear instruction. Moreover it is contradicted by another hadith – even if it is da’if – which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was treated with cupping then he prayed and did not do wudu. This indicates that it is not obligatory to do wudu after vomiting. This is the correct view, that whatever comes out from the body does not invalidate wudu even if it is a lot, whether it is vomit, saliva, blood , pus or anything else, unless it is urine or stools, such as if an opening is made in the body to let them out, in which case wudu is invalidated when they come out from that opening.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 11/198) For more, please see these answers: 174361 , 44980 , and 82759 . And Allah knows best."
197,She wants some advice for her Christian classmates,"Question In the University where I am studying there is a considerable number of Christians, and it has reached a stage where some of them are proselytizing, even though they are in a Muslim country and living among the Muslims. One of them even carries the Gospel with her, and another book about “faith”, on which there is a picture of the Virgin Mary (peace be upon her), and she encourages the girls to read it. After that, from speaking to her I found out that she is active in the church, and she teaches the children there. Now I am confused about how to interact with her and others like her. Should I cut off ties with her and warn others about her, or should I try to debate with her about her beliefs? Please note that I tried – once – to find out about some of what she believes so that I could work out how to debate with her, but I found out that she is well aware of matters of debate. It is as if she was trained in what she had to say, and she was equipped with how to debate and interact with Muslims. I did not have enough knowledge to argue with her or debate with her.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We appreciate your protective jealousy (gheerah) concerning the religion of Allaah, may He be exalted, and for your interest in calling others to Allaah, and we ask Allaah to guide us and you and to make us and you steadfast. Secondly: We do not advise you to debate with your Christian colleagues, because you stated that they have specious arguments that you are not able to refute, and you said that you are a beginner in seeking knowledge. This makes us repeat this advice in your case and the case of those who are like you. The principle is that the permissibility of that is limited to situations in which the interests served by doing it are greater than the negative results thereof, or in situations where arguing is kept at a level of friendly debate rather than fighting. Fath al-Qadeer by al-Shawkaani, 1/527. The purpose which you seek to achieve by debating with the People of the Book or other types of people who associate others with Allaah, or people who follow whims and desires or innovations, can only be achieved if it is undertaken by those who are qualified for it, who have sufficient knowledge of their own religion and the other religion to debate it, and who also follow the shar’i etiquette that is prescribed for us in such matters. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Because the followers of the Prophets are people of knowledge and justice, when the followers of Islam and the Sunnah speak with the kuffaar and followers of bid’ah, they speak with knowledge and justice, not with speculation and whims. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Judges are of three types, two of whom will be in the Fire and one in Paradise. A man who knows the truth and judges accordingly will be in Paradise. A man who knows the truth and judges otherwise will be in the Fire. And a man who judges among people on the basis of ignorance, will be in the Fire.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and others [and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’]. If he is one of those who pass judgment among people concerning their wealth, lives and honour, and he is neither knowledgeable nor just, then he will be in Hell, so how about one who judges concerning sects and religions, and the basic principles of faith, knowledge of the divine and other fundamental pricnples, with no knowledge or justice, like the followers of innovation and whims and desires. Al-Jawaab al-Saheeh li man baddala Deen al-maseeh, 1/107-108. Because of what Shaykh al-Islam mentioned here about the etiquette of debate, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islamic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong; and say (to them): ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you; our Ilaah (God) and your Ilaah (God) is One (i.e. Allaah), and to Him we have submitted (as Muslims)’” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:46] Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer: Here Allaah is forbidding arguing with the People of the Book, if it is done with no knowledge of argument or with no appropriate basis, and He says that we should not argue with them except in a way that is better, with a good attitude, kindness and gentle speech, calling to the truth and making it attractive, and refuting falsehood and making it unattractive, in the most effective manner. The purpose behind it should not simply be to debate and argue, and loving to win, rather the purpose should be to demonstrate the truth and guide people. End quote. Tafseer al-Sa’di 743. You should also focus on seeking knowledge. Before a Muslim learns about what others believe, he has to learn his own religion and its rulings. So look for sisters who are seekers of knowledge and start to learn your religion with them. You can also make use of tapes by the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah who promote the way of the righteous salaf, especially if there is no one available who can teach you. Your primary concern should be to learn that which will correct your belief and worship. Study the meanings of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is the sound way with which you should begin. Forget about debating with Christians and other followers of misguidance and leave that to those who are specialized in that field, for they are more able to debate with them and point out where they have gone wrong. There are still people in the Muslim ummah who can do this duty – praise be to Allaah. If you think that the Christian proselytizing is having some impact on your Muslim sisters, then you must warn them against making friends with these kaafir women or listening to them. You can also provide them with books and tapes which explain true Islam, and warn against false sects and religions. We ask Allaah to help you to do that which pleases Him, and to enable you to gain beneficial knowledge and do righteous deeds. And Allaah knows best."
198,Should he pray in the mosque where there are some innovations or in the prayer-room in his building?,"Question I am a student at an Islamic University in Malaysia. I am very keen to pray in congregation as much as I can in the Jaami‘ (main mosque), but I have some reservations about what some of those who lead us in prayer do of things that are not in accordance with the Sunnah (according to my knowledge), such as reciting du‘aa’ in unison after each prayer, and mixing the adhaan with the Qur’an sometimes, and making the final prostration lengthy in order to say du‘aa’, and singling it out for that purpose. In contrast, we have prayer-rooms in the student residences in which prayers are held in congregation, the adhaan and iqaamah are given openly, and one of the students leads the prayers, and none of the innovations mentioned above are committed. Which of the two places is better to pray in?.","Praise be to Allah. Offering the prayer in congregation in the mosque is obligatory for men who are able to do it, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of evidence mentioned previously in the answers to questions no. 8918 and 120. If you can hear the call to prayer, then what you are required to do is to pray with the congregation in the mosque. You should advise the imam and tell him what is Sunnah; then if he insists on offering du‘aa’ in unison, do not join in the du‘aa’. See questions no. 10268 and 105644. What is meant by hearing the call to prayer is that if the individual can hear the adhaan in a normal voice without a loudspeaker, if the mu‘adhdhin raises his voice, and there is no wind or noise, or other things that may affect one’s ability to hear it. If you cannot hear the call to prayer, then it is permissible for you to pray in the prayer room in your residence; in that case you should weigh up the pros and cons, such as if your attending the mosque will result in your having contact with ordinary people and calling them and teaching them. In that case, it is more important for you to pray in the mosque than to pray in the prayer room in the student residence, and so on. And Allah knows best."

200,She aborted the foetus in the first month because she hates her husband,"Question My wife has a friend who is newly married. It was not written for this marriage to continue. After some time both husband and wife decided to have divorce. Before they separated they found out that the wife is one month pregnant. The wife, may Allah guide her, aborted the fetus intentionally saying that she does not want to have any form of relationship with her husband anymore. She does not suffer from any illness, and her husband is a moral man. When the husband found out what his wife did, he divorced her and told her that he is dissatisfied with what she did and he will never forgive her. What is the ruling on what she did? What is the expiation for it? And what should be done with her?.","Praise be to Allah. The fuqaha’ differed concerning the ruling on abortion before forty days of pregnancy and before the soul has been breathed into the foetus. A number of Hanafis and Shaafa’is, and some Hanbalis, are of the view that it is permissible. Ibn al-Humaam said in Fath al-Qadeer (3/401): Is it permissible to abort after becoming pregnant? It is permissible so long as it has not yet taken on a shape. Elsewhere they said: And that can only be after one hundred and twenty days, which implies that what they meant by taking on a shape was the breathing in of the soul, otherwise it is does not make sense, because the taking on a shape visibly occurs before that. End quote. Al-Ramli said in Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (8/443): The correct view is that it is haraam after the soul has been breathed in in all cases, and it is permissible before that. In Haashiyat al-Qalyoobi (4/160) it says: yes, it is permissible to abort it even by using medicine before the soul is breathed into it, contrary to the opinion of al-Ghazaali. Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf (1/386): It is permissible to take medicine to abort the nutfah. This was stated in al-Wajeez, and before that in al-Furoo’. Ibn al-Jawzi said in Ahkaam al-Nisa’: It is haraam. It says in al-Furoo’: The apparent meaning of the words of Ibn ‘Aqeel in al-Funoon is that it is permissible to abort it before the soul is breathed into it and he said: He has a point. End quote. The Maalikis are of the view that it is not permissible at all, and this is the view of some of the Hanafis and some of the Shaafa’is and some of the Hanbalis. Al-Dardeer said in al-Sharh al-Kabeer (2/266): It is not permissible to expel maniy (semen) that has settled in the uterus even before forty days, and once the soul has been breathed into it, it is haraam according to consensus. This view was favoured by the Council of Senior Scholars. It says in a statement issued by the Council: 1-It is not permissible to abort pregnancy at any stage except for a legitimate shar’i reason within very strict limits. 2-If the pregnancy is in the first stage, which is forty days, and aborting it will serve a shar’i interest or ward off harm, it is permissible to abort it. As for aborting it at this stage for fear of hardship in raising children or for fear of being unable to afford their maintenance and education, or because of fears concerning their future or because the couple feel that they have enough children, that is not permissible. End quote. Secondly: According to both views – that it is permissible or that it is haraam – this wife has done something haraam because she did that without her husband’s permission or approval. So she has to repent to Allaah and regret what she has done, but she does not have to offer any expiation. And Allaah knows best."
201,It is not permissible for the pilgrim who is doing tamattu‘ to do the sa‘i of Hajj before standing in ‘Arafah and halting in Muzdalifah,"Question A man who is doing Hajj tamattu‘ [i.e., ‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between] did ‘umrah, then he went to Jeddah, and on the eighth day [of Dhu’l-Hijjah] he came to Makkah and did tawaf and sa‘i with the intention of being exempt from having to do sa‘i on the day of Eid. Is he exempt from that, or not?","Praise be to Allah. It is well-known in the case of one who is doing tamattu‘, that he enters ihram for ‘umrah, does tawaf and sa‘i, then he cuts his hair and exits ihram. Then on the day of at-Tarwiyah [8 th Dhu’l-Hijjah], he enters ihram for Hajj and goes out to Mina; it will not benefit him if he does sa‘i before that, because it is not permissible to do the sa‘i of Hajj before standing in ‘Arafah and halting in Muzdalifah. However, if he is doing qiraan [Hajj and ‘umrah together, without exiting ihram in between], or ifraad [Hajj on its own], and he does sa‘i after tawaf al-qudoom [tawaf of arrival], then that is acceptable. Therefore, this man who did sa‘i ahead of time must avoid relations with his wife, if he has a wife, and he must travel to Makkah and do sa‘i, because he did it at the wrong time. It is best for him to enter ihraam for ‘umrah when he reaches the miqaat, and do tawaf and sa‘i, and cut his hair, then do the sa‘i of Hajj. ""(Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 22/87, 88)"
202,"He died and left behind a wife, three sons and five daughters","Question A man died and left behind a wife, two sons who are full brothers, a son who is a half brother, and five girls. Can you answer me?.","Praise be to Allah. If a man dies and leaves behind three sons, two of whom are from his wife and the third from another wife, and he leaves behind five daughters, then the estate is to be divided as follows: The wife gets one-eighth, because there are descendents who inherit. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if you leave a child, they [wives] get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts” [al-Nisa’ 4:12] The children, male and female, get the rest, with each male getting a share like that of two females, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females” [al-Nisa’ 4:11]. In order to divide the estate (mathematically) among the heirs, it must be divided into 88 equal shares. The wife gets 11 shares, each son gets 14 shares and each daughter gets 7 shares. i.e., The wife’s share is: The estate x 11 ÷ 88. Each son’s share is: The estate x 14 ÷ 88. Each daughter’s share is: The estate x 7 ÷ 88. In this manner the share of each heir can be worked out precisely. And Allaah knows best."
203,Dry impurity does not pass to the one who touches it,"Question If a child urinates on the bed then I sit on this bed after it has dried, do my clothes become naajis (impure)?.","Praise be to Allah. Dry impurity does not pass to the one who touches it, so his garments do not become naajis and neither does his body. If a person sits on dried urine, his clothes do not become naajis as a result of that, and he does not have to wash them. Najaasah (impurity) is only transmitted if it is wet. So if the impurity is wet or the hand of the one who touches it is wet, then it is transmitted as a result. Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said: If a person touches a wet impurity, then he must wash whatever of it touched his body, because the impurity has been transmitted to it. But if the impurity is dry, then he does not have to wash the part of the body that came in contact with it, because it is not transmitted to him. End quote. Al-Muntaqa Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: Does dried urine not make clothes impure? i.e., if a child urinates on the ground and the urine remains there until it dries without being washed off, then someone comes and sits on the urine when it has dried, does his garment becomes impure? He replied: Touching dry impurity does not affect the body or dry clothes, and it does not matter if one enters a dry washroom with dry feet, because the impurity is only transmitted when it is wet. End quote. Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (1/194) And Allaah knows best."
204,She vowed to beat her son,"Question In a fit of anger, I vowed to beat my son until his blood flowed, but I did not do it. What do I have to do? May Allaah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allah.You have to offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow), because this beating is not an act that can bring you closer to Allaah; it is the matter of a personal attempt to deal with something. So if you did not do it, you have to offer kafaarat yameen. And because beating him until his blood flows is not permitted. The vow which you describe in this case is like a vow to commit sin; it is not permissible to fulfil a vow to commit sin, and the expiation for that is kafaarat al-yameen, which is: Feeding ten poor people, or clothing them, or freeing a believing slave. Whoever is unable to do any of these three things can fast for three days. Feeding the poor is done by giving them half a saa’ of the staple food of the country, whether it is dates, wheat, rice or whatever. The equivalent weight is approximately one and a half kilograms. And Allaah is the source of strength."
205,"Ruling on giving zakat al-fitr to his ex-wife, with whom his son lives, and they are poor and do not have enough money to spend on themselves","Question Is it permissible for me to give zakat al-fitr to my ex-wife, as she is poor, and my son is living with her, and their situation is not good, as they do not have enough to spend on themselves?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: What is required of you is to spend on your son, on a reasonable basis, which includes his food, drink, clothing, medical treatment, school expenses and shelter, if his mother does not have accommodation of her own to share with him. It is not permissible for you to give your zakaah to your son, because in that way you are saving your own wealth that you should be paying on his maintenance. There is no differentiation between zakat al-fitr and other types of zakaah. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/269): Zakaah cannot be given to parents or children. Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to give zakaah to parents in cases where the one who is giving it to them is obliged to spend on them, because giving his zakaah to them will mean that there is no need for him to spend on their maintenance and he would no longer be required to do that, so the benefit of that would come back to him, and therefore it is as if he is giving it to himself. Similarly, he should not give it to his child. Imam Ahmad said: He should not give zakaah to his parents, his children, his son’s son, his grandfather, his grandmother or his daughter’s son. End quote. Secondly: It is permissible to give zakaah to one’s ex-wife after the ‘iddah has ended, if she is poor and does not have sufficient maintenance from a relative of hers. It says in Haashiyat Qalyoobi wa ‘Umayrah (3/197): The one who has sufficient maintenance from a relative or spouse is not regarded as poor according to the more correct opinion, because he is not in need, such as one who earns every day sufficient enough to meet his needs. End quote. However, during the ‘iddah, a divorced woman comes under the same ruling as a wife, and it is not permissible to give zakaah to her. See also the answer to question no. 146241. And Allah knows best."
206,Sinning in Front on One’s Kids,Question Is it counted as committing sin openly if a person commits sin in front of his children?,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to our shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah preserve him), who answered as follows: I seek refuge with Allah! This is worse than committing sin openly, because in addition to committing sin openly, it is giving a bad upbringing. Question: If he does it inside his own house and not in front of people, will he still be counted as is committing sin openly? Answer: If he were to do it in his own room on his own, we would not say that this committing sin openly, but the fact that he is doing it in front of his children means that he is giving them a bad upbringing as well as committing sin openly. Hence smokers must not smoke in front of their children, because by doing so they are teaching them to smoke. And Allah knows best."
207,How to purify oneself from madhiy (pre-seminal fluid),"Question It prayer valid if one did not wash madhiy (pre-seminal fluid) from the testicles? I heard that the Shaaf ‘is, Maalikis, Hanafis and some of the Hanbalis do not think that we needs to wash the testicles?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Madhiy is something impure (najis) from which we must purify ourselves. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The regular, well-known substance of madhiy is a matter concerning which there is consensus and no difference of opinion among the Muslims that it is obligatory to do wudu because of it, and it is obligatory to wash it off because it is impure (najis).""(At-Tamhid (21/207). So if it is emitted and any of it gets onto the body, it is obligatory to wash the place it got onto. If someone prays knowing that there is any madhiy on his body and he deliberately did not wash it, then his prayer is not valid. For the ruling on prayer offered when the body or clothes are not pure (tahir), please see the answers to questions no. 12720 and 195117. Secondly: If the madhiy gets onto the testicles, then they must be washed in order to remove this impurity, as stated above. But if the madhiy did not get onto them, and it did not go beyond the place where it was emitted, then in this case there is a difference of opinion among the scholars: is it sufficient to wash only the area of the penis where it was emitted, or must the entire penis, along with the testicles, be washed? The view of Imam Ahmad is that both the penis and the testicles must be washed. Al-Mirdawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Based on the view that it is impure (najis), the penis and testicles must be washed if it is emitted, according to the correct view.""(Al-Insaf c2/328-329). He quoted as evidence for that the report narrated in as-Sahihayn from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined washing the private part; the apparent meaning indicates that what is meant is the entire private part. In books other than as-Sahihayn – such as Musnad Ahmad etc. – it is narrated that it is enjoined to wash the testicles. It was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was a man who emitted a great deal of madhiy, so I told a man to ask the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about that, because of the position of his daughter. He said: “Do wudu and wash your private part.” Al-Bukhari (269) and Muslim (303). The apparent meaning of the word is that the entire private part is to be washed; however, the majority of scholars said that what is meant by “private part” here is the place where the madhiy is emitted, and not the entire private part. They supported that by comparing it to all other types of impurities; in all other cases it is only required to wash the place where the impurity is. Ibn Daqiq al-‘Id (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars differed as to whether he should wash the entire private part, or only the place where the impurity is. The majority are of the view that washing may be limited to the place where the impurity is…""(Ihkam al-Ahkam 1/74). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is required is to wash only the place where the impurity is. This is our view and the view of the majority.""(Al-Majmu‘ 2/144). Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars differed concerning what is meant by the command to wash the private part in the case of madhiy. Does it mean to wash only the area of the private part where the madhiy got onto it – as is the case with urine – or to wash the entire private part? There are two views concerning that, both of which were narrated from Malik and Imam Ahmad.""(Fath al-Bari 1/304). Ibn Daqiq al-‘Id (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The majority of scholars chose not to interpret the word “private part” as referring to the entire area; rather they focused on the context, as what makes washing obligatory is the emission of the substance, which dictates that one may limit washing to the place from which it was emitted and the place it got to [on the body or clothes].""(Ihkam al-Ahkam 1/74). Abu Ja‘far at-Tahhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In support of the view that only the place of emission and the place it got to [on the body or clothes] is to washed, we may say by analogy that the emission of madhiy is an emission of something that invalidates wudu; as in the case of urination and defecation, all that is required is to wash the place from which it was emitted and the place it got to [on the body or clothes], and there is no need to wash any more than that, unless one wants to do wudu and pray. The same applies with regard to bleeding from any part of the body, according to the view of those scholars who regard bleeding as invalidating wudu. This is the way in which emission of madhiy is to be dealt with. As emission of madhiy is something that invalidates wudu, it does not require any washing apart from washing it from wherever it got on the body, and apart from washing in order to purify oneself for prayer (wudu). Thus this argument is further supported by reasoning. This is the view of Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on them).""(Sharh Ma‘ani al-Athar 1/48). Those who say that it is impure (najis) responded to that by noting that there is nothing to prevent suggesting that washing more than the place where it is emitted is required. There is a similar case to that in Islamic teaching, which is that it is obligatory to wash the entire body when maniy is emitted. They also mentioned a benefit of that, which is that washing the penis and testicles stops the emission of madhiy. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: And because it is emitted as a result of desire, therefore it is reasonable to suggest that it is obligatory to wash more than the place where it is emitted, as in the case of maniy. That is because the testicles are its vessel, so washing them will put a stop to it.""(Sharh al-‘Umdah 1/103). It was narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (2/293), and by Abu Dawud (208), from Hisham ibn ‘Urwah, from ‘Urwah, than ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib said to al-Miqdad … and he mentioned a similar report and said: So al-Miqdad asked him, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him wash his penis and testicles.” Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in at-Talkhis al-Tahbir (1/117): It was narrated by Abu Dawud via ‘Urwah from ‘Ali, and in it it says: “Let him wash his testicles and his penis.” ‘Urwah did not hear [directly] from ‘Ali, but Abu ‘Awanah narrated in his Sahih from ‘Ubaydah from ‘Ali with some additional material, and there is nothing wrong with its isnad. End quote. As-San‘ani said in Subul as-Salam (1/199): As it is sahih (sound), there is no reason not to accept the ruling based on it. End quote. Abu Dawud (211) narrated from al-‘Ala ibn al-Harith, from Haram ibn Hakim, from his paternal uncle ‘Abdullah ibn Sa‘d al-Ansari, who said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about what necessitates ghusl and about water [madhiy] that is emitted after water [maniy]. He said: “That is madhiy, and every male emits madhiy. So wash it from your private part and your testicles, then do wudu as for prayer.” (1/207). Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud (1/381). Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is required in the case of madhiy is to wash the penis and testicles.""(Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz 17/58). The scholars of the Permanent Committee for Ifta said: … With regard to madhiy, it is impure (najis). If you emit madhiy, you must wash the penis from its base, and the testicles, and sprinkle water over whatever parts of the clothes and body the madhiy got onto, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed ‘Ali to wash his penis and testicles and do wudu in the case of madhiy, and he instructed him to sprinkle water over whatever of it got onto his clothes. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. Permanent Committee for Academic Research and Ifta ‘Abdullah ibn Qa‘ud, ‘Abdullah ibn Ghadyyan, ‘Abd ar-Razzaq ‘Afifi, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdillah ibn Baz.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah 5/382). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the correct view with regard to washing the penis and testicles when madhiy is emitted? He replied: The correct view is that it is obligatory, and there is a medical benefit in doing that, which is that washing the penis and testicles stops the emission of madhiy.""(Ta‘liqat ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin ‘ala al-Kafi). So the correct view is that it is obligatory to wash the penis and testicles when madhiy is emitted, because of the soundness of the hadith which enjoins that. With regard to the validity of prayer, with regard to such matters which are subject to ijtihad, there is no blame on the one who follows one of the two scholarly views, so long as he believes that it is the correct view, or he is following a scholar whose view it is. Please see also the answer to question no. 234599. And Allah knows best."
208,The people of the Cave are the people of the Inscription,"Question Were the people of the Cave the people of the Inscription, or were these two different groups of people?","Praise be to Allah. Shaykh al-Shanqeeti said, commenting on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Do you think that the people of the Cave and the Inscription (the news or the names of the people of the Cave) were a wonder among Our Signs?” [al-Kahf 18:9] The apparent meaning is that the People of the Cave and of the Inscription were all one group, mentioned in conjunction with two things. This is in contrast to those who say that the people of the Cave were one group and the people of the Inscription were another group. Allaah told this story to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them) in this soorah, and He did not mention anything about the people of the Inscription. This is unlike those who claim that the people of the Cave were three persons behind whom the rock fell and blocked the entrance of the cave in which they were, so they prayed to Allaah by virtue of their righteous deeds; they were one who honoured his parents, one who was chaste, and one who was a hired labourer. Their story is well known and is proven in al-Saheeh, but interpreting this aayah as meaning that these were the people referred to therein is far-fetched as you can see. It should be noted there is nothing about the story of the people of the cave, their names and which part of the earth they were in that has been narrated in any sound report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), in addition to what is mentioned in the Qur’aan. The Mufassireen quoted many of those details from the Israa’eeliyyaat (reports from Jewish sources) which we will not quote here because they cannot be relied upon."
209,Her husband is very bad-tempered and has divorced her three times,"Question I have been married for approximately nine years. My husband is a very very bad-tempered person, more than you can imagine. When he gets angry he loses his mind and does things that he does not mean. I am not giving excuses, but this is how it is and Allaah is witness to that. My problem is that on several such occasions he spoke the word of divorce (talaaq) and I want to know: does this count as a divorce or not? On the first occasion we were travelling abroad and there was a big problem. He said to me: “You are divorced when we go back to our country.” He says that this was intended as a threat, to scare me. In fact we came back to our country and he forgot about the matter, but I did not forget. I asked our Shaykh and he said that this did not count as a divorce and he explained that to me. On the second occasion, following a big problem he beat me then left the house. I did something foolish, and sent him nine messages on his cell phone, all of them insults and put-downs. He sent me a message saying “You are divorced.” That happened in the afternoon, and he came back at night and it was as if nothing had happened and we made up. On that occasion I also asked a Shaykh and he said that the divorce sent by message did not count. On the third occasion, there was another big problem and he got very angry, to such an extent that he did not know what he was doing. He divorced me and I went to my family’s home, but he went to the court and the qaadi ruled that the divorce did not count, so he took me back after the family got involved, and I went back to him. In all these cases he did not really mean to divorce me, and in fact the last of these incidents took place nearly two years ago. He has not repeated these words since, and his temper has calmed down in general. But my problem is that I always wonder whether I am living with him in haraam? Did the divorce count as such? I do no know if the shaytaan is whispering to me or not?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: we ask Allaah to make things easier for you and to help you and guide you, and to set things straight between you and your husband. Secondly: With regard to what you have asked about in these three incidents, the answer is as follows: 1 – In this case your husband said to you, “You are divorced when we return to our country.” In this case the divorce took effect when you returned to your country, because this was a clear statement of divorce, i.e., it was not intended to encourage you to do something or prevent you from doing something, or to confirm or deny something. If we assume that he said: “I meant that I would divorce you after coming back,” this cannot be accepted from him either, because his saying, “You are divorced” is clearly one of the words of divorce (talaaq), so it cannot be accepted that he meant it as a threat of divorce. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: An oath to divorce is a statement of divorce by means of which the person intends to encourage (his wife) to do something, or to prevent her from doing something, or to urge his listeners to believe him or disbelieve him. This is the oath to divorce which is intended to encourage or discourage something, or to confirm or deny something, unlike a statement of divorce which is intended as such, which cannot be regarded as an oath, such as saying, “When the sun rises, my wife is divorced,” or “When Ramadaan comes, my wife is divorced.” This is not described as an oath (yameen), rather it is simply a statement of divorce in which a condition is stipulated, and when the stipulated event takes place, the divorce comes into effect. End quote from Fataawa al-Talaaq, p. 129-131 We have already answered a similar matter in question no. 43481 2 – In this incident, he sent you a message by phone saying, “You are divorced.” This depends on his intention at the time of writing it. If he was determined to divorce you, then it counts as a divorce, but if he wrote that but meant something other than divorce, such as to alarm his family and scare them, then it does not count as a divorce because that was not his intention. See the answer to question no. 72291. 3 – In this incident, he got so angry that he did not know what he was doing, and he divorced you, then he went to the court and the qaadi ruled that the divorce did not count. What matters here is the ruling passed by the qaadi, because there are some cases of anger in which divorce does not count. From what your husband told him, the qaadi may have realized that his anger was so intense that it means that the divorce does not count. In the answer to question no. 45174 we have mentioned the ruling on a divorce given in a moment of anger. Our advice to this husband is to fear Allaah and to control his tongue and avoid uttering words of divorce, so that this will not led to the break-up of his family. We ask Allaah to help and guide you both. And Allaah knows best."
210,Ruling on repeating du’aa’s after the mutawwif (Hajj guide) in a loud voice,"Question What is the ruling on repeating some du’aa’s after the mutawwif (Hajj guide) in a loud voice, if raising the voice will cause disturbance to people who are praying and doing tawaaf there?.","Praise be to Allah. Saying du’aa’ so that people behind one or to one’s right or left may repeat it is something for which there is no basis in the actions of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). As for raising the voice in du’aa’, if that disturbs the people who are doing tawaaf or annoys them, then it is not allowed, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to his Companions, when he heard them reciting out loud when they were praying in the mosque: “Do not raise your voices over one another with the Qur’aan”, or he said “when reciting”. Hence we say to people who are doing tawaaf: Do not recite out loud and disturb the people; rather each person may offer whatever supplication he likes. Hence if these mutawwifs say to the people: Do tawaaf and say Takbeer at the Black Stone and say, “Rabbana aatina fi’l-dunya hasanah wa fi’l-aakhirah hasanah wa qina ‘adhaab al-naar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire),” [al-Baqarah 2:201], and say whatever du’aa’ you wish during the rest of tawaaf, and remember Allah, and recite Qur'aan, and make sure that the people understand that, this would be better and more beneficial to the people, because each person could call upon his Lord and ask for whatever he needs and understand the meaning of what he is saying. This is unlike what the mutawwifs do now of reciting du’aa’s which those who are behind them do not know, and if you were to ask these people who are saying du’aa’ behind the mutawwif about the meaning of the words they are saying, in most cases they would not know. If people were to call upon their Lord with supplications of which they know the meaning and can benefit from, that is better than this. End quote.

211,"Ruling on inhaling air from the desert air cooler when fasting, even though the cooler uses water","Question I would like to ask about the ruling on inhaling air that comes out of the desert air cooler whilst fasting, as this device must be fed water so that it can moisten the air.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is nothing wrong with using the desert air cooler during the day in Ramadan, and inhaling the air that comes out of it is not regarded as breaking the fast, even if the air cooler is fed with water. Even if we assume that droplets of water come out of it sometimes, they dissipate in the air, so none of the water vapour droplets reaches the person’s mouth or nose, and nothing of that goes beyond his throat. Inhaling air is permissible. The air that comes from the air cooler does not have any substance, like bakhoor (incense), for example, and the droplets of water with which it is fed do not have any substance in the air emitted by the cooler, especially if you keep away from it and you are not right next to where the air is emitted from the cooler. If it so happens that a fasting person was close to the air cooler and is certain that some of the water droplets entered his mouth, he must spit it out.

Secondly: A person may feel less thirsty when there is an air cooler, just as he will feel less thirsty if he fasts in cold weather. That does not affect his fast, and it is not the result of water vapour in the air; rather it is because of the cold temperature that results from the air cooler, and the cool air that comes from other types of air conditioners is much colder than that which comes from these desert air coolers. Inhaling cold air does not have a greater impact than putting water on one’s body or head, because the moisture of water reduces the feeling of thirst. In fact, the skin absorbs water, but that does not break the fast. Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter on bathing for one who is fasting. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wetted a garment and put it on when he was fasting. Ash-Sha‘bi entered the public bathhouse when he was fasting… al-Hasan said: There is nothing wrong with rinsing one’s mouth and cooling down for one who is fasting… Anas said: I have a tub in which I bathe when I am fasting. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (4/197): The [word translated here as] tub is a hollowed-out rock like a cistern. It seems that the tub was filled with water, and when Anas felt too hot he would sit in it to cool down. End quote. It seems that this tub was like what is known nowadays as a bathtub. Abu Bakr al-Athram narrated with his isnad that Ibn ‘Abbaas entered the bathhouse when he was fasting, along with some companions of his, during the month of Ramadan. End quote from al-Mughni (3/18). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on having a shower or bath more than once during the day in Ramadan, or sitting beside the air conditioner or air cooler all the time, when this cooler emits moisture? He replied: In the previous answer, we spoke of evidence which indicates that that is permissible, and there is nothing wrong with it. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pour water over his head because of the heat, or because of thirst when he was fasting, and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) would wet his garment with water when he was fasting, to cool himself when it was intensely hot, or because of thirst, moisture does not have any impact [on the fast], because it is not water that reaches the stomach."" (Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 19/285). And Allah knows best."
212,"If he has been wronged by his family and his brothers, does he have the right to limit his interaction with them to greeting them with salaam?","Question If someone has been wronged by his family and brothers, and they are persisting in their attitude, does he have the right to reduce his interactions with them, and limit it to greeting them with salaam? Is that permissible, or is it regarded as shunning which is prohibited?","Praise be to Allah.For a woman to uphold ties of kinship with her brothers and sisters is something that is emphasized in Islamic teachings, because of what is mentioned in the Qur’an and Sunnah of the command to uphold ties of kinship and the prohibition on severing such ties. This upholding of ties may be achieved by visiting, keeping in touch and asking after them, according to whatever a person is able to do. You should not fall short in this important righteous deed, and you should not let the harshness of your siblings or their mistreatment of you prompt you to do that, for you will be rewarded for upholding ties with them, even if they fall short in their treatment of you. Muslim (2558) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that a man said: O Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I try to uphold ties, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they mistreat me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me. He said: “If you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you against them so long as you persist in doing that.” What is meant by “putting hot ashes in their mouths” is a metaphor for what they incur of sin, which is likened to the pain that the one who eats hot ashes feels. And it was said that what is meant is that what they consume of your kindness is like hot ashes that burn their stomachs. But if mixing with them is hurtful to you and increases resentment between you and your relatives, then you can limit it to greeting them with salaam, and you can visit them and talk to them less frequently. Greeting with salaam negates the shunning that is prohibited, and protects you from sin. Al-Bukhaari (6237) and Muslim (2561) narrated from Abu Ayyoob that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other when they meet. The better of them is the first to greet the other with salaam.” Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The scholars differed with regard to two people who shun one another, then one of them greets the other with salaam: does that negate the shunning or not? Ibn Wahb narrated from Maalik that he said: If he greets him with salaam, then he has ended the shunning. It is as if – and Allah knows best –he understood this from the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “The better of them is the first to greet the other with salaam,” or from the words of the scholar who said that greeting with salaam puts an end to shunning. Abu Bakr al-Athram said: I said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: If he greets him with salaam, does that suffice instead of speaking to him? He said: That depends on how it was before he shunned him. If it is known that he used to speak to him and be friendly with him, then it does not negate that shunning unless it is a greeting which is not followed by turning away from him or turning his back on him. This meaning was narrated from Maalik."" (At-Tamheed 6/127). An-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: “The better of them is the first to greet the other with salaam” means that he is the superior one. This offers support for the view of ash-Shafa‘i and Maalik, and those who agreed with them, that greeting with salaam negates shunning and protects completely against sin. End quote. And Allah knows best."
213,Who should pay the zakaah on land that is rented out for cultivation?,"Question A man rented some land to cultivate it. Should the zakaah be paid by the owner of the land or the tenant? If the tenant has to pay it, should the zakaah be paid on the total yield or on what is left after paying the rent?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: If the owner of the land cultivates it himself, then he should pay zakaah on whatever it produces. If he gives it or lends it to someone else to cultivate it, then that person should pay zakaah on whatever it produces. The scholars differed concerning rented land and whether the zakaah should be paid by the owner or the tenant who cultivates it. The majority were of the view that it should be paid by the one who cultivates it; the Hanafis were of the view that it should be paid by the owner. Ibn Hazm said: There is no zakaah on dates, wheat or barley unless a man has five wasqs of one type of them. A wasq is sixty saa’s, and a saa’ is four mudds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). A mudd is somewhere between one and a half and one and a quarter ratls. This applies whether he grew it on land belonging to him or land belonging to someone else, whether he took that land by force or by means of a valid deal or an invalid deal, whether the land was taxable land or land on which one-tenth of the produce is to be paid. This is the view of the majority, and of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Abu Sulaymaan. Abu Haneefah said: He should pay zakaah regardless of the amount, whether it is a little or a lot. If the land is classed as kharaaj land (taxable land) then there is no zakaah on its produce. If the land is rented then the zakaah should be paid by the owner of the land, not the one who cultivates it. Al-Muhalla, 4/47 The imam refuted the view of the Hanafis and explained that the zakaah is to be paid on the produce and not on the land, as the Hanafis say. Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi said: Whoever rents land and cultivates it, the one-tenth should be paid by him and not by the owner of the land. This is the view of Maalik, al-Thawri, Shareek, Ibn al-Mubaarak, al-Shaafa’i and Ibn al-Mundhir. Abu Haneefah said: (Zakaah) should be paid by the owner of the land, because it is part of the maintenance costs of the land, so it is like a kharaaj or tax. Our view is that it should be paid on the produce, so it should be paid by the grower of the produce, like zakaah on the value of goods that are prepared for sale, and like the one-tenth on produce that he owns. Their view that it is part of the maintenance costs of the land is not correct, because if that were the case, zakaah would be due on the land even if it were not cultivated, like the kharaaj tax, and it would be obligatory on dhimmis too, like the kharaaj, and it would be based on the value of the land, not on the value of the produce, and it would have to be spent in areas in which booty may be spent, not in areas in which zakaah may be spent. Al-Mughni, 2/313, 314 This is the view favoured by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/88 Secondly: As zakaah is due on the produce, he has to pay the zakaah on the entire harvest, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisaab), which is five wasqs. A wasq is sixty saa’s, which is equivalent to approximately 657 kilograms. The one who is paying the zakaah has no right to deduct the rent of the land even if that is after he sold the produce – whether out of ignorance, by mistake or as the result of a misunderstanding – before paying zakaah. The correct scholarly view is that no cost that he spent on the land should be deducted from the zakaah. Ibn Hazm said: It is not permissible for the one who has produce or dates to deduct what he spent on tilling, harvesting, gathering, threshing, manure, digging etc from the zakaah, whether he took out a loan for that or not, or whether the total costs were greater than the value of the harvest or not. This is a matter concerning which the earlier generations disputed… [Here Ibn Hazm mentioned the dispute in detail, then he said:] Abu Muhammad said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that zakaah must be paid on the total amount of dates, wheat and barley, if it reached the minimum threshold (nisaab), which is five wasqs or more. The zakaah is not waived because of the expenditure of the grower or owner of the date-palms. It is not permissible to cancel out a duty enjoined by Allaah if there is no Qur’aanic text or proven hadeeth to that effect. This is the view of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Abu Haneefah and our companions. Al-Muhalla, 4/66 And Allaah knows best."
214,Does the fact that a disbeliever will be a Muslim’s ransom from the Fire mean that none of the Muslims will ever enter the Fire?,"Question I had a question about a Hadith that I read. I was wondering if someone could explain this in detail. Does this Sahih Hadith mean that no Muslim would go to hell? Abu Burda reported on the authority of his father that Allahs Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: No Muslim would die but Allah would admit in his stead a Jew or a Christian in Hell-Fire. 'Umar b. Abd al-'Aziz took an oath: By One besides Whom there is no god but He, thrice that his father had narrated that to him from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him).","Praise be to Allah.Muslim (2767) narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will give every Muslim a Jew or a Christian, and He will say: This is your ransom from the Fire.” Muslim also narrated (2767) from Abu Burdah that he told ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, from his father, that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No Muslim man dies but Allah causes a Jew or a Christian to enter the Fire in his stead.” ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez asked him to swear by Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, three times that his father narrated that to him from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he swore to him. Ibn Maajah (4341) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one among you who does not have two abodes: an abode in Paradise and an abode in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise inherit his abode. This is what Allaah says: ‘These are indeed the inheritors’ [al-Mu’minoon 23:10]. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Ransom” means salvation and sacrifice. What this hadeeth means is that which is mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: everyone has an abode in Paradise and an abode in Hell. If the believer enters Paradise, the disbeliever in Hell will take his place, because he deserves that due to his disbelief. What is meant by the words “your ransom from the Fire” is that you were exposed to the risk of entering the Fire, and this is your ransom, because Allah, may He be exalted, decreed a number for it to fill it. Because the disbelievers will enter it because of their disbelief and sin, they will become like ransoms for the Muslims. End quote from Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi (17/85) Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Because every accountable person has a place in Paradise and a place in Hell, whoever believes truly, his place in Hell will be replaced with a place in Paradise, but for the one who does not believe it will be the opposite, and it will be as if the disbelievers took the places of the believers in Hell. Moreover, because Allah has sworn to fill Hell, it will be filled with the disbelievers so as to save the believers from the Fire. So in that regard they are like a ransom for the believers. Perhaps the reason why the Jews and Christians are singled out for mention is because they are well known for their opposition to the Muslims and for being their opposites with regard to believing in the Messenger, which dictates that they should be saved. End quote from Mirqaat al-Mafaateeh (8/3525). To sum up all of that: On the Day of Resurrection there will be a Jew or a Christian for every Muslim, who will be his ransom from the Fire. That does not contradict the fact that some Muslims sinners will enter the Fire for their sins, so that Allah may purify them thereof, because they will enter it, then they will be brought out of it by Allah’s mercy, then they will enter Paradise, where they will inherit what would have been the disbelievers’ places in it, because Allah has forbidden it to the disbelievers. The words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “Allah (st) will give every Muslim a Jew or a Christian, and He will say: This is your ransom from the Fire.” Indicate that this bounty will include all the Muslims, with no exceptions, because ransom is salvation, as mentioned above, and salvation will be for every Muslim. That is not contradicted by the fact that he may enter the Fire, because his entering it will be for the purpose of purification. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: No evil doer or anyone who has a trace of evildoing will enter Paradise. Whoever is purified in this world and meets Allah pure and free of any impurities, will enter it with out ma’ooq. Whoever is not purified in this world, if his impurity is inherent, as in the case of the disbeliever, he will not enter paradise under any circumstances, but if his impurity is acquired because of sin and is transient, he will enter Paradise after having been purified in the Fire from that impurity, then he will be brought out of the Fire. Endquote from Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/56) Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, it will benefit him someday in his life, no matter what befalls him before that.” Narrated by at-Tabaraani in al-Mu ‘jam al-Awsat (6396); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Targheeb (1525) For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 147996 and 138650 And Allah knows best."
215,Ruling on eating cheese made by Magians (Zoroastrians),"Question What do the scholars say about the soundness of these mawqoof hadiths that were narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah? Abu Bakr told us: Jareer told us, from Mugheerah, from Abu Waa’il and Ibraaheem, who said: When the Muslims came, they got some food from the Magians, their cheese and bread, and they ate and did not ask about that. The cheese was described to ‘Umar, and he said: Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130). Abu Bakr told us: Abu Mu‘aawiyah told us, from al-A‘mash, from Shaqeeq, from ‘Amr ibn Shurahbeel, who said: We mentioned cheese in the presence of ‘Umar, and we told him that it was made with rennet of animals that died of natural causes, and he said: Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130). Abu Bakr told us: Wakee‘ told us, from Sufyaan, from Jahsh, from Mu‘aawiyah ibn Qurrah, from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali that he was asked about cheese and said: There is nothing wrong with it, mention the name of Allah over it as you are cutting it, and eat. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah (5/130).","Praise be to Allah.With regard to the first isnaad, its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), the men of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, but Mugheerah – whose full name is Mugheerah ibn Miqsam ad-Dabbi – is mudallis [i.e., he engaged in tadlees, which is when a narrator narrates a hadith that he did not hear directly from his shaykh, without mentioning the name of the third party from whom he did hear it, using wording that may or may not give the impression that he heard it directly] and he narrated it by saying ‘an [meaning “from”, instead of saying “So and so told us” or “I heard So and so saying” etc] from Abu Waa’il and Ibraaheem. See: Tadhdheeb at-Tahdheeb (10/241); ath-Thiqaat by Ibn Hibbaan (7/464). What appears to be the case is that it is acceptable here because reports narrated by Mugheerah from [‘an] Abu Wa’il and Ibraaheem were narrated in as-Saheehayn, in marfoo‘ reports, and the reports here is mawqoof, and undoubtedly leniency is more acceptable in mawqoof reports. With regard to the second isnaad, its men are also the men of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. With regard to Abu Mu‘aawiyah, although more than one of the scholars had some reservations about him, their reservations were only with regard to reports other than the reports he narrated from al-A‘mash. As for the reports he narrated from al-A‘mash in particular, he used to have a good memory of them, and he is one of the most trustworthy companions of al-A‘mash. Wakee‘ said: We have not met anyone who was more knowledgeable of the reports narrated by al-A‘mash than Abu Mu‘aawiyah. See: at-Tahdheeb (9/121). Mugheerah differed from al-A‘mash. Mugheerah narrated it from Abu Waa’il – with corroborating reports from Ibraaheem, who is an-Nakha‘i – from ‘Umar, and al-A‘mash narrated it from Abu Waa’il – whose name is Shaqeeq ibn Salamah – from ‘Amr ibn Shurahbeel from ‘Umar. The hadith of al-A‘mash is more sound. Whatever the case, it is narrated soundly from ‘Umar, whether via Mugheerah or via al-A‘mash. With regard to the report of al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali, its isnaad includes Jahsh whose full name is Jahsh ibn Ziyaad ad-Dabbi. Ibn Abi Haatim mentioned him in al-Jarh wa’t-Ta‘deel (2/550), but he did not mention any details regarding him. Al-Bukhaari also mentioned him in at-Taareekh (2/253) and said: ath-Thawri, Abu Bakr and Muhammad ibn Fudayl ibn Ghazwaan narrated from him. End quote. Ibn Hibbaan mentioned him in ath-Thiqaat (6/157). Therefore not much is known about him. Some scholars regard as hasan the hadith of narrators such as this, especially mawqoof reports such as this. The ruling on rennet varies according to its source. If it is taken from an animal that was slaughtered in the prescribed manner, then it is pure (taahir) and may be eaten. If it is taken from an animal that died of natural causes or from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner, then there is a difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ regarding that. The majority of the Maalikis, Shaafa‘is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is najis (impure). Abu Haneefah and Ahmad, according to another report from him, are of the view that it is taahir (pure). This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), who said in al-Fataawa (21:103): What is more likely to be the case is that their – that is, the Magians’ – cheese is halaal and that the rennet and milk of an animal that died of natural causes are taahir. That is because when the Sahaabah conquered Iraq, they ate the cheese of the Magians, and this was the prevalent practice among them. What is narrated from some of them, that they regarded that as makrooh, is subject to further examination. End quote. See questions no. 2841 and 115306. And Allah knows best."
216,Is there a text that limits “greeting the mosque” to the first three rows of the mosque?,Question Is there a text that limits “greeting the mosque” to the first three rows of the mosque?.,"Praise be to Allah.We do not know of any basis for this view. The prayer for Tahiyyat al-masjid (greeting the mosque) may be done in any place in the mosque, it does not have to be done only in the first three rows in the mosque. The matter is open; wherever it is easy for the Muslim to pray in any part of the mosque, he may pray there. And Allaah knows best."
217,Dispute in the mosque about making prayers long or short,"Question We have a mosque in the Islamic centre, and there has arisen a dispute among the worshippers about making the prayers long or short. I hope that you can inform us of what is said in the sharee’ah about this matter.","Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Mu’aadh led his companions in praying ‘isha’ and he made it lengthy. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Do you want to be a cause of fitnah? When you lead the people in prayer, recite Wa’l-shamsi wa duhaahaa (al-Shams 91), Sabbih isma rabbik al-A’laa (al-A’laa 87), Iqraa’ bismi Rabbik (al-‘Alaq 96), and Wa’l-layli idha yaghshaa (al-Layl 92).’” (Agreed upon; this version narrated by Muslim). Al-Haafiz said: Whoever follows the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by being brief and complete, no one will complain that he is taking too long. The description of the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is well-known. Therefore the briefness in prayer which is enjoined is something which is relative, and must be measured against what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, persisted in and enjoined upon others, not the desires of the members of the congregation. It was narrated in al-Saheehayn that Anas said: “I never prayed behind anyone who made the prayer more brief and more perfect than the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” He said in al-Mubdi’: They evaluated the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his sujood lasted the length of time it takes to say Subhaan rabbi al-A’laa ten times. His rukoo’ was of a similar length. And he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said: “pray as you have seen me praying.” Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: he (the imaam) does not have the right to make the prayer longer than what is prescribed. He should usually do what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) usually did, and make it longer or shorter according to the circumstances, just as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: For imaams to keep the prayer brief is a matter on which there is scholarly consensus that it is mustahabb, as long as he meets the condition of making it complete. The hadeeth of Jaabir quoted above indicates that reciting the soorahs mentioned or similar soorahs is what is considered to be moderate in prayer. What is prescribed is for the rukoo’ and sujood to be of similar length to the recitation. And Allaah knows best."
218,A new Muslimah is doubtful about the obligation of wearing hijab when praying,"Question Im a new muslim revert. Im wondering how a muslimah is to dress during prayer. It doesn't say to wear hijab during salaat in quran or at least I couldn't find it. Will my prayers still be accepted if I don't wear hijab or something that doesn't cover my body? I wear hijab in public and around men but I know Allah isn't looking at me sexually so why do I have to cover up? When I die I will only be wearing a white sheet and no clothes and when I rise from the grave on judgment day, I will still have no clothes on. When I speak to Allah on judgment day I will be naked so why is it not ok for me to speak to Allah during salaat wearing whatever I want? Allah sees everything and he is my creator so that means he sees me naked all the time. Islam and salaat is supposed to be easy. I feel I'm losing my Iman and I haven't been praying lately because of this issue and I can't find the right answer. I want to pray wearing only my pajamas (short and t-shirt) but I'm afraid something bad will happen to me if I don't wear hijab.","Praise be to Allah.First of all, we would like to congratulate you for the blessing of Islam and faith, and we ask Allah, may He be exalted, to bless you and guide you in this world and the hereafter. You should understand that the wise person is the one who is fair-minded and thinks objectively, paying attention to all angles of the matter he is examining, so that he will not fall prey to contradiction: today he finds himself doubting the reason why he should cover up when praying, but if the Sunnah was to be uncovered when praying, he would soon find himself having doubts and questioning the reason why one should uncover oneself too. So when Islam enjoins covering up he objects to it, and if it were to enjoin uncovering he would object, and so on. On this website, we hear about the thoughts of confused and troubled people a great deal, as they are living in a vicious circle to which there is no end unless they block the whispers of the Shaytaan, otherwise the Shaytaan may well impact their religious and worldly affairs. All people understand that the issue of clothing differs from one situation to another. The workplace and formal occasions are not like leisure trips or being at home. A person’s situation in this world is not like his situation in the grave, beneath the earth; whoever thinks that these situations should be alike is contradicting sound reasoning, and will end up thinking that these rational standards contradict one another, but his thinking is not based on any rational or shar‘i principles. By the same token, in your question you want to compare your situation when standing before Allah in prayer to your situation in the grave or on the Day of resurrection, or to your situation when you are wearing house clothes or pyjamas! Not only that, you think that this wrong analogy is becoming a serious problem in your mind, and a catastrophe that you cannot stop thinking about, to such an extent that doubts have begun to creep into your heart. This is a sign of lack of reasoning which requires you to ponder and think about it, so that you do not let it affect your affairs in this world, let alone the hereafter. Fine, if you want to draw analogies, which situations will you choose? Would you prefer to pray naked, as your mother bore you and as you will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection? Or do you want to pray in a shroud whilst you are still alive in this world, as the deceased is wrapped in his shroud? The situation you are looking for is not what Allah has prescribed, neither is it akin to the situation of the deceased in his grave or the situation of people on the Day of Resurrection. You are not following the conclusions of your own analogy or the teachings of Islam. Let us say that there is no good reason for all of that, and there is nothing that deserves all this thought or doubts. The matter is far too insignificant for that. If you were to ask any wise person about the wisdom behind Muslim men and women covering when they pray, he would not hesitate to tell you that it is for the purpose of showing respect, being modest and observing proper etiquette before Allah, may He be glorified, when standing before Him and communicating with Him. It is something wonderful to stand before Him, may He be glorified and exalted, when you are fully dressed in the manner that He asks of you and that He loves for you, which is to wear hijab and to cover the head in particular, as well as the rest of the body. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying and when going round (the Tawaaf of) the Ka‘bah, and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)” [al-A‘raaf 7:31]. What is meant by “while praying” is at the time of every prayer, whether it is in the mosque or otherwise. Al-‘Allaamah as-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is, cover your ‘awrah at the time of all prayers, obligatory or voluntary, for covering it is adornment for the body, whereas uncovering leaves the body unpleasing and off-putting. It may be that what is meant by adornment here is more than merely covering, namely clean and proper clothing. This indicates that it is enjoined to cover the ‘awrah when praying and to choose nice clothes for it, and keeping that clothing clean and free of dirt and impurities. End quote from Tayseer al-Kareem ar-Rahmaan (p. 287) Prayer is a serious matter, in which one is standing before Allah; the Muslim slave converses in the prayer with his Lord, focusing his mind and heart on his Lord and Creator, with presence of mind, humility and tranquillity, hoping for His mercy and fearing His punishment; he places his head and nose on the ground in humility before Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. In this important situation, nothing is befitting except for the Muslim man or woman to be completely and properly clothed, in garments that befit a meeting with the King of kings, may He be glorified and exalted, not in night clothes or work clothes. Moreover, you have to realise and have a firm belief – as you are a sincere Muslim – that Islam means submitting and surrendering to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, because of what is mentioned in His holy Book and what is narrated in the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What the Muslim must do, if he finds himself confused and unable to see the wisdom in any matter, is to seek the light of Revelation which will show him the way; this Revelation which comes from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is to be found in the Qur’an and Sunnah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe (in Moosa (Moses) (i.e. Jews) and ‘Eesa (Jesus) (i.e. Christians))! Fear Allah, and believe too in His Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight), and He will forgive you. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Hadeed 57:28] “Certainly, We have brought to them a Book (the Qur’an) which We have explained in detail with knowledge, - a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe” [al-A‘raaf 7:52]. The Muslim seeks guidance in Islamic teachings, and is not like those of whom Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah)” [al-Hajj 22:8]. This is one of the basic meanings of Islam, faith in Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and belief in His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – not what you are doing of doubting every little thing to the extent that you describe in your question. There is no justification for that, for you could have continued to pray as the Muslims do, then ask whatever questions you wanted to after that; you should not have given in to the whispers and doubts of the Shaytaan and stopped praying altogether. The Holy Qur’an is the word of Allah, and the word of Allah is perfect, fair and precise; it has no shortcomings whatsoever. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the One Who says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it) , and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment” [al-Hashr 59:7]. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed women to cover themselves when praying, and to wear hijab and cover their heads. It is proven from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept the prayer of any woman who menstruates unless (she wears) a head cover.” [What is meant by a “woman who menstruates” here is a woman who has reached the age of menstruation, not a woman who actually has her menses.] See Ma‘aalim as-Sunan (1/180). Narrated by Abu Dawood in as-Sunan (641); at-Tirmidhi in as-Sunan (277) – he said: It is a hasan hadeeth. The ruling of the scholars based upon this hadeeth is that when a woman reaches the age of puberty, if she prays with any part of her hair uncovered, then her prayer is not valid. Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They were unanimously agreed that the free adult woman must cover her head when she prays, and that if she prays with all of her head uncovered, then she must repeat the prayer. End quote from al-Ijmaa‘ (p. 43) If you do not want to follow the Prophet’s Sunnah with regard to this matter, then why do you pray Zuhr with four rak‘ahs, when you will not find this number in the Book of Allah? Why do you give zakaah at a rate of 2.5%, when you will not find this number in the Qur’an either? In fact the Muslims take all of those numbers from the saheeh Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), for Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is but a revelation revealed” [an-Najm 53:3-4]. Our scholars (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the verse “while praying” [al-A‘raaf 7:31] is one of the teachings of the Qur’an that helped primitive nations to become civilised. Just as the Arabs during the Jaahiliyyah used to circumambulate the Ka‘bah naked, many nations did not have the culture of wearing clothing and adorning themselves with clothing. By requiring people to dress fully, Islam became one of the means of those nations taking a huge leap forward in terms of civilisation. Al-‘Allaamah Muhammad Rasheed Rida (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This instruction to wear adornment “while praying” – and not only in al-Masjid al-Haraam – is one of the basic principles that form a sound foundation for a person’s religious and worldly affairs. Some of the value of this principle may be understood from the reports that speak of the reason for revelation of these verses. Indeed, in order to fully appreciate its value we need to know something of the history of nations and religions, and to understand that most wild peoples who live in the bush and in the jungle, as individuals or in groups, and live in caves, and many idol worshipping tribes who live on ocean islands and African mountains all live naked, both women and men. But whenever Islam reached any of these peoples, it taught them to wear clothes by making it obligatory to cover themselves and adorn themselves. When some European missionaries went to extremes in criticising Islam in order to put people off it and turn them away from it, and to incite Europe against the Muslims, one fair-minded person among them responded by reminding them that the spread of Islam in Africa was in fact a blessing to Europe, because it had spread civility among the people by making them give up nakedness and obliging them to wear clothes, and this was the reason for the European textile industry finding a market among them! Indeed I say that there are some idol worshipping nations that have a strong civilisation and a high level of various branches of knowledge and the arts, but most of them live naked, but when any of them is guided to Islam, they begin to wear clothes and adorn themselves, then they begin to make clothes. Then their idol-worshipping neighbours begin to imitate them to some extent. Thus we see India, whose civilisation was highly developed in the past and at present, despite the prevalence of idol worship; you still find thousands of their women and men fully naked or half naked or three quarters naked. You see some of the men in stores and factories almost naked, covering only the private parts, or only covering the lower half of the body; and a woman may leave her belly, thighs or the upper part of her body – all or some of it – uncovered. Some of their fair-minded scholars have admitted that the Muslims are the ones who taught them to wear clothes and to eat from vessels. Many of the poor people still put food on leaves and eat from them. But they are better off than many other polytheists in terms of covering and adornments, because the Muslims used to rule them, and Indian Muslims are still among the most advanced Muslims on Earth in terms of knowledge, deeds and influence over the idolaters in their country. As for the Muslims further east, where ignorance is prevalent, they are closer to the idolaters than to the Muslims in terms of the way they dress and in many of their religious rituals. An example is the Muslim women of Thailand who do not regard any part of the body as ‘awrah apart from the private parts, as mentioned above. Wherever Islam grows stronger, then you will find that covering and adornment that is befitting of human dignity and civility. Whoever understands this will realise the value of this important principle in Islam. Were it not for the fact that this most civilised faith made clothing and adornment part of the religion of Allah – i.e., He made it obligatory upon His slaves – it would not have transformed so many nations and peoples, leading them from extreme wildness to refined civility. The one who does not recognise this blessing is the one who is ignorant of history, even if he claims to have knowledge of it. In fact it is not unlikely to find a westernised pretender who sits in a casino or cafe or pub, leaning back with his hat tilted on his head, saying: What does it mean to say that people should adorn themselves with clothes as part of religious matters, at a time when it is necessary for all humans to cover themselves and there is no need for divine revelation or a religious decree? End quote from Tafseer al-Manaar (8/340-341) On our website we have previously published a number of fatwas which explain how a woman should dress for prayer; please see the following questions: 11073, 69804, 32993 To sum up: Prayer in which one stands before Allah is something of great importance which requires the Muslim woman to wear complete hijab, paying attention to proper etiquette before Allah. This is something other than the clothes that one wears at home, which is light clothing. Moreover, the Muslim receives light and guidance from the Holy Qur’an and saheeh Sunnah, so he should not make his views and doubts judge of the revelation that comes from Allah. And Allah knows best."
219,Defining Laylat al-Qadr; is it possible for a person to catch up with Laylat al-Qadr twice in the same Ramadan?,"Question How can we understand the scholarly opinions of within last ten in between moving from odd-to-odd nights of Laylatul Qadr by rotation based on Qur’aan and Sunnah? In case someone who traveled and experienced two back-to-back odd nights in two differently moon-sighted countries, also if that odd night happens to be the real Lailatul Qadr based on the next morning signs of both the countries, then is there the possibility for him fortunately to experience two Qadr nights in one Ramadan indeed? Further, what is the nature of odd-even for characterizing the last ten nights as it varies depending on its definition of oddness/evenness whether to be defined as keeping beginning in mind (i.e. what have passed) or whether keeping end in mind (i.e. what remains)? In this regard, how do we also understand the statement that indicates praying 4 rakaats after Isha is equivalent to experiencing Qadr itself, or praying Magrib and Isha in congressional in the Qadr night is equivalent to getting the whole portion of Qadr itself?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Defining Laylat al-Qadr Laylat al-Qadr occurs in the last ten nights of Ramadan, on one of the odd-numbered nights – that is, on the night of the twenty-first, the twenty-third, the twenty-fifth, the twenty-seventh or the twenty-ninth. It may also happen on an even-numbered night, because the even-numbered nights are odd-numbered if we count backwards from the end of the month, counting what remains of the month, if the month is complete (thirty days), as al-Bukhaari (2022) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is in the last ten nights, when nine of the last ten nights have passed, or when seven of the last ten nights remain” – referring to Laylat al-Qadr. It was narrated from Khaalid, from ‘Ikrimah, from Ibn ‘Abbaas: Seek it on the twenty-fourth. So counting of the nights may be based on what has passed, or on what remains, as al-Bukhaari (2021) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Seek it in the last ten nights of Ramadan, meaning Laylat al-Qadr, when nine nights remain, when seven nights remain, when five nights remain.” Muslim (1167) narrated that Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) observed i‘tikaaf during the middle ten days of Ramadaan, seeking Laylat al-Qadr before it was shown to him. When they were over, he ordered that the tent be taken down, then he was shown that it (Laylat al-Qadr) was in the last ten nights, so he ordered that the tent be put back, then he came out to the people and said: “O people, Laylat al-Qadr was shown to me, and I came out to tell you about it, but two men came disputing, and the shaytaan was with them, and I was caused to forget it. So seek it in the last ten nights of Ramadaan, seek it on the ninth, the seventh and the fifth.” I [the narrator] said: O Abu Sa‘eed, you know better about what the numbers refer to than we do. He said: Yes, we are more likely to know about that than you. I said: What are the ninth, the seventh and the fifth? He said: When twenty-one nights have passed, the one that follows them is the twenty-second, and that is the ninth [from the end]. When twenty-three nights have past, the one that follows that is the seventh [from the end]. When twenty-five nights have past, the one that follows that is the fifth [from the end]. Hence the one who wants to catch Laylat al-Qadr should pray qiyaam on all ten nights. Ibn ‘Atiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (5/505): Laylat al-Qadr moves around in the odd-numbered nights of the last ten nights of Ramadan. This is the correct and reliable view, and it is an odd-numbered night, depending on whether the month is complete (thirty days) or incomplete (twenty-nine days). So the one who is watching for it must watch for it from the twentieth night onwards, every night, until the end of the month, because the odd numbers when counting backwards if the month is complete will not be the same if the month is incomplete. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When three remain, when five remain, when seven remain.” And he said: “Seek it on the third, the fifth, the seventh, and the ninth [from the end].” Maalik said: What he meant by the ninth is the night of the twenty-first. Ibn Habeeb said: What Maalik meant is that this applies if the month is incomplete. It seems that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) took into account that the month could be either complete or incomplete, so that one will not be entirely sure of having caught Laylat al-Qadr unless he prays qiyaam on all of the last ten nights. End quote. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Laylat al-Qadr is in the last ten nights of Ramadan. It was soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: It is in the last ten nights of Ramadan.” It may be on one of the odd-numbered nights, but what is odd-numbered is based on what has already passed, so he should seek it on the night of the twenty-first, the night of the twenty-third, the night of the twenty-fifth, the night of the twenty-seventh, and the night of the twenty-ninth. Or what is odd-numbered may be based on what remains, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “… When nine nights remain, when seven remain, when five remain, when three remain.” Based on that, if the month is thirty days, then counting backwards from the end, Laylat al-Qadr will be on one of the even-numbered nights, so when nine nights are left, that is the twenty-second; when seven nights are left, that will be the twenty-fourth, and so on. This is how Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri understood the saheeh hadith. If the month is twenty-nine days, then counting the days based on what remains is the same as counting the days based on what has passed. As that is the case, the believer should seek Laylat al-Qadr on all of the last ten nights, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Seek it in the last ten nights.” And it is more likely to be in the last seven. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (25/284). Secondly: Is Laylat al-Qadr different in different countries? Can Laylat al-Qadr vary from one country to another? If countries differ with regard to the beginning of the month, then odd-numbered nights in one country will be even-numbered in another, but that does not mean that Laylat al-Qadr will occur on two different nights, such that a person could catch it in his country, then travel to another country and catch up with it again in that country. Rather it is one night. So if Laylat al-Qadr occurs on the twenty-seventh of Ramadan, for example, and the twenty-seventh may be on Tuesday or Wednesday in different countries, because they started Ramadan on different days, then Laylat al-Qadr can only be on one of those days. If it is on Tuesday night, it cannot be on Wednesday night, and vice versa. So if Laylat al-Qadr was on Tuesday, then it was on the night of the twenty-seventh according to some people, and on the night of the twenty-sixth according to others. This emphasizes the importance of not missing any of the even-numbered nights, because it may in fact be odd-numbered, and there was a mistake with regard to the beginning of the month. There is only one scenario in which someone could catch up with the same night twice, such as if Laylat al-Qadr is on the Tuesday night, and he catches up with it or with part of it, then he travels westwards; in that case he could catch it again, because the night begins earlier in the east. And Allah knows best."
220,Celebrating special occasions and festivals – what is permissible and what is not?,"Question In these times, when we are living in a global village with all other communities, is it permissible to celebrate people’s birthdays and weddings in an Islamic fashion, in which we do not engage in any un-Islamic practices, so long as these special occasions and celebrations are not connected to any religion, as is the case with regard to Halloween, Christmas, and Valentine’s Day, which have Christian roots, the Hindu festival of Diwali, and so on? Is it permissible to celebrate special occasions that have nothing to do with religion? I know that it is possible to hold a simple celebration as mentioned in the fatwas on the websites islamonline.net and daruliftaa.com. I find it very difficult to convince my children that what we have been doing for fifteen years and everything that is practised around us is not Islamic and is not acceptable in our religion. Please answer me, bearing in mind everything I have mentioned.","Praise be to Allah.According to Islamic teaching, there is nothing wrong with having celebrations on the occasions of marriage or other worldly occasions, on condition that they are free of reprehensible matters such as free mixing and music. These celebrations do not come under the heading of acts of worship that are intended to bring one closer to Allah, may He be exalted; rather they are gatherings to express joy and happiness, and the basic principle with regard to customs and traditions is that they are permissible. This is in contrast to acts of worship, concerning which the basic principle is that they are not allowed unless there is evidence to show that they are prescribed. Among the celebrations that are prohibited according to Islamic teaching – apart from those which involve reprehensible practices and sins – are those in which there is any imitation of the disbelievers, such as birthday celebrations and Mother’s Day. The prohibition is more emphatic if they take a form which resembles the festivals prescribed in Islam. This is the case with regard to those occasions, as they are called “ ‘eid al-milaad (lit. “festival of birth” i.e., birthday) and “ ‘eid al-umm” (lit. festival of mothers, i.e., Mother’s Day). These are occasions which involve imitation of the disbelievers and those whom we are forbidden to imitate. The prohibition is more emphatic if the aim of the one who celebrates it is to draw closer to Allah, may He be exalted, thereby, because this is combining sin and innovation (bid‘ah). The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: What is the ruling on celebrating children’s birthdays? There is a saying among us that it is better to fast on that day instead of celebrating it. What is the correct view? They replied: Celebrating birthdays or fasting because it is one’s birthday is all innovation (bid‘ah) for which there is no basis. Rather the Muslim should seek to draw closer to Allah by doing that which He has enjoined upon him and by doing supererogatory acts of worship. In all cases he should be grateful to Him and praise Him for all the days and years during which he has been sound in body and he, his property and his children have been safe. End quote.

221,"She finished her ‘umrah and went to Mina with the people, and completed the rituals without entering ihram for Hajj","Question My mother, who is fifty-seven years old, went for Hajj, and her intention was to do Hajj tamattu‘ (i.e., to do ‘Umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between and entering ihram anew for Hajj). After doing ‘umrah on the eighth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, she cut her hair, but she did not enter ihram anew because she did not know about that. She completed the remaining rituals of Hajj and offered a sacrifice at the end. Does she have to offer a fidyah?","Praise be to Allah.If the person who is doing tamattu‘ exits ihram following his ‘umrah, then the time for Hajj comes, he should enter ihram for it. Ihram is the intention to do the rituals, and the place for the intention is the heart; it is neither stipulated nor recommended to utter it, nor is it stipulated to do ghusl and clean oneself, although it is preferable to do ghusl when entering ihram. A woman may enter ihram in her ordinary clothing; she does not have to wear any specific garments. If what you mean is that she did not do ghusl or utter the intention or recite the talbiyah, or she did not put on a special garment, then that does not matter. The fact that she went out with the people to Mina, then to ‘Arafah, and she did the rituals, and refrained from doing the things that are prohibited, all of that indicates that the intention to do Hajj was present. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: A woman does not know the three ways of doing Hajj, and she does not know the intention for that. She has done Hajj five times, and she does Hajj on the day of at-Tarwiyah (the eighth of Dhu’l-Hijjah). She goes with the people, when they go to ‘Arafah and to Muzdalifah, and she stones the Jamaraat. She does not have a specific intention for any of the three ways of doing Hajj. Is her Hajj during these years valid? He replied: What appears to be the case is that her Hajj is valid, because it is as if she is saying: I am entering ihram for whatever the people have entered ihram for, and entering ihram for whatever someone else entered ihram for is permissible, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib during the Farewell Pilgrimage, when he had come from Yemen with Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari (may Allah be pleased with them both). He said to him: “For what have you entered ihram?” He said: For whatever the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has entered ihram for. Then he said: I have the hadiy (sacrificial animal) with me. So he made it qiraan (‘umrah followed by Hajj without exiting ihram in between). As for Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari, he said that he had entered ihram for what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had entered ihram for, but he did not have a sacrificial animal with him, so he instructed him to make it ‘umrah, because tamattu‘ is better than qiraan. It seems to us that this woman undoubtedly entered ihram for whatever the people entered ihram for, and that she said: I will do whatever the people do. But when a person wants to do an act of worship, whether it is Hajj, fasting, giving charity, or anything else, he must learn before he goes ahead and does it. But if after doing it he comes and asks: what is the ruling? This is undoubtedly not the best approach. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (22/22) What appears to be the case is that the Hajj of this woman is valid, and she does not have to do anything. And Allah knows best."
222,Praying for the kaafir to be guided or else be punished by Allaah,"Question What is the ruling on praying for Allaah to guide some wrongdoers and evildoers or kaafirs, and if He does not guide them, may He seize them with such a penalty that comes from One exalted in power and able to carry out His will? Is this du’aa’ permissible? Or does it come under the heading of letting Allaah choose?.","Praise be to Allah. This is not letting Allaah choose, rather it is asking for them to be guided by Allaah, whilst referring the matter of their being guided to His will and wisdom. If that is done for them then praise be to Allaah, otherwise may Allaah protect us against their evil by seizing them with such a penalty that comes from One exalted in power and able to carry out His will, as a punishment for their wrongdoing and so as to cleanse the earth of their filth. So it is a permissible du’aa’. And Allaah is the Source of strength, May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

223,"If he gives iftaar to a rich relative, he will have the reward of one who gives iftaar to a fasting person","Question I hope that you can tell me whether giving iftaar to a relative of mine who is well off is included in the hadeeth, “Whoever gives iftaar to one who is fasting…”?.","Praise be to Allah. This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (807) from Zayd ibn Khaalid al-Juhani who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives iftaar to one who is fasting will have a reward like his, without that detracting from the reward of the one who fasted.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. This hadeeth is general in meaning and applies to all who fast, whether they are rich or poor. It also includes relatives and others. See Fayd al-Qadeer by al-Manaawi, commentary on hadeeth no. 8890. Indeed, giving iftaar to a fasting person who is a relative may bring a greater reward, because by doing so you may earn the reward of giving iftaar to one who is fasting and of upholding the ties of kinship, so long as the one who is not a relative is not a poor person who cannot find any food with which to break his fast, in which case giving him iftaar will bring a greater reward because that will be meeting his needs. By the same token, giving charity to a poor relative brings a greater reward than giving charity to a poor person who is not a relative. Al-Tirmidhi (658) and Ibn Maajah (1844) narrated that Salmaan ibn ‘Aamir al-Dabiy said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Charity given to a poor person is charity, but charity given to a relative is two things: charity and upholding the ties of kinship.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. Al-Haafiz said in Fath al-Baari: It is not necessarily the case that a gift given to a relative is better in all situations, because there is the possibility that a poor person may be in desperate need and the other person (the relative) may not need it at all. Conclusion: Giving iftaar to a relative comes under the meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever gives iftaar to one who is fasting will have a reward like his,” and giving him iftaar may bring a greater reward than giving iftaar to one who is not a relative, or it may be the opposite, depending of the needs of those concerned and the interests served by giving him iftaar. And Allaah knows best."
224,His father does not let him pray Fajr in the mosque – should he obey him?,"Question I am 16 years old and the mosque is close to our house, but my father does not allow me to pray Fajr there, although he lets me offer all the other prayers there. He says that he is afraid that something may happen to me, because between our house and the mosque there is an intersection. I have spoken to him a great deal and tried to convince him by quoting verses and ahaadeeth, but to no avail. Should I go and pray without his knowledge?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: To begin with, we would like to congratulate you for these good intentions and keenness to offer the obligatory prayers in congregation. We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in adhering to Islam and righteousness, and we pray that your father’s actions will not put you off from doing what is right and following true guidance. Before answering your question, we should mention a very important matter, which is: Honouring and obeying one's parents has been enjoined by Allaah in many places in His holy Book, such as the verses in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents …” [al-Nisa’ 4:36] “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. 24. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young’” [al-Isra’ 17:23, 24] Obedience to parents is obligatory, unless they tell you to disobey Allaah, in which case you are not obliged to obey them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience if it involves disobedience towards Allaah, rather obedience is only in matters that are right and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6830; Muslim, 1840. With regard to prayer in congregation, this is obligatory, and it is not permissible for a father to forbid his son who has reached the age of maturity to do it. Rather parents should enjoin their sons to pray in congregation and encourage and urge them to do so. If the father notices that his son is falling short in that regard, then he must make him aware of his responsibilities and remind him that he will be questioned about it before Allaah on the Day of Reckoning. So he should enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and remind those who are under his care of their duties towards their Lord and the seriousness of neglecting those duties. If the father falls short in his duties towards his children by not enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, or encouraging them to do good and warning them against evil, this does not absolve them (the sons) of sin if they fall short in their duties or commit haraam actions. If the father forbids his sons to perform a duty that has been enjoined upon them by Allaah, in that case they do not have to obey him by disobeying Allaah or by forsaking that which Allaah has commanded. If the father tells his son not to offer all or some of the prayers in congregation, then he has told him to commit a sin, and this case he is not to be obeyed, but at the same time he should be treated with kindness and respect. With regard to your question about going secretly to pray Fajr, this is good on your part, but it is treating your father badly without realizing it. You father is committing a sin so long as he forbids you to pray in congregation, and even if you go out secretly, the burden of sin is not lifted from him, because he is still telling you to do something wrong and forbidding you to do something good, even if you go out to pray without his knowledge. So you have to try to convince him of the Islamic ruling, even if you get someone else to do it, if he will not listen to you or he thinks you are too young. If he does not respond, then there is no sin on you if you go out without his permission or knowledge, but you have to be very careful when going to the mosque. Secondly: We say to your father – may Allaah guide him – that Allaah has given you a great responsibility, which is to teach and advise your family, including your wife and children. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon: “Each of you is a shepherd and responsible for his flock. The man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock.” Allaah has commanded you to protect yourself and your family from His Fire, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded” [al-Tahreem 66:6] And He says, enjoining the prayer (interpretation of the meaning): “And enjoin As‑Salaah (the prayer) on your family, and be patient in offering them [i.e. the Salaah (prayers)]. We ask not of you a provision (i.e. to give Us something: money): We provide for you. And the good end (i.e. Paradise) is for the Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Ta-Ha 20:132] Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Whoever neglects to teach his son that which will benefit him, and ignores him, has done something very bad indeed. Most children go astray because of their parents who neglect them and fail to teach them the duties and Sunnahs of their religion. They neglect them when they are young so they do not benefit themselves or benefit their parents when they grow up. End quote. Tuhfat al-Mawdood, p. 229 We ask you an important question: Where are you when it is time for Fajr prayer? Is it not obligatory for you to offer the prayer in congregation? Is it not obligatory for you to be a good example for your family and children by praying in congregation in the house of Allaah? If you do that, you will have fulfilled the duty that Allaah has enjoined upon you, and you will have helped your son to pray in the mosque, and you will put your mind at rest if you are worried about him going alone. Remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us that whoever prays Fajr in the mosque will be under the protection of Allaah, so how can you fear for one who is under the protection of Allaah, may He be exalted? It was narrated that Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr is under the protection of Allaah, so do not fall short with regard to the rights of Allaah, for anyone who does that, Allaah will seize him and will throw him on his face into the Fire of Hell.”Narrated by Muslim, 657. We ask Allaah to help you to fulfil the trust and to make you a good example for your family, and to make you help your son to offer the prayers in the house of Allaah. And Allaah knows best."
225,A man’s giving gifts to his wife,"Question Is it proven that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave any gift to any of his wives, or is it proven that any of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with him) gave any gift to his wife? I hope that the answer will be supported with evidence from the religious texts.","Praise be to Allah.We have not come across many examples of a man giving a gift to his wife at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Perhaps the reason for that is that gifts would be mixed with maintenance [as it is the man’s responsibility to spend on his wife], or because of the situation of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them), because they lived an austere life and did not accumulate a great deal of worldly wealth as the people who came after them, and as is the case nowadays. But establishing the virtue of a man giving a gift to his wife does not depend on there being examples of that in the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather in that regard it is sufficient to note the command to treat one’s wife kindly. Islam encourages the giving of gifts, as in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Exchange gifts; you will love one another.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (594); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel (6/44). And the wife is one of the people who are most deserving of gifts from her husband. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are the best of you to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3895); he said: This is a hasan saheeh hadith. It was narrated from Hakeem ibn Mu‘aawiyah al-Qushayri that his father said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the rights of the wife of one of us over him? He said: “That you should feed her when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself…” Narrated by Abu Dawood (2142); classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel (7/98). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good” [an-Nisa’ 4:19]. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “And live with them in kindness” means: speak kindly to them, and act kindly towards them, and make your appearance good as much as you can. Just as you would like that from her, do that for her too, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable” [al-Baqarah 2:228]. And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are the best of you to his wife, and I am the best of you to my wives.” It was the Prophet’s character to always treat his wives kindly, with a cheerful, gentle and playful attitude; he would spend generously on them and joke with his wives. End quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (2/242). For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 182290 and 261441. And Allah knows best."
226,What Is Salat al-Hajah?,Question My question has to do with praying to Allah for a need. I know it is called salat al-hajah. How many times does a person have to pray it and when should it be prayed. Is it right to pray it at the times when dua’s are most likely to be,"Praise be to Allah.Worship Allah the Prophet’s way It is prescribed for the Muslim to worship Allah in the ways that He has prescribed in His Book, and in the ways that have been proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The principle concerning matters of worship is tawqeef [i.e., following what is in the Quran and sahih Sunnah; with no room for individual opinion]. And we cannot say that any act of worship is prescribed unless there is sahih evidence. What is Salat al-Hajah? The so-called Salaat al-Hajah was narrated in da’if (weak) or munkar (denounced) ahadith – as far as we know – which cannot be used as proof and which are not fit to base acts of worship on. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/162) Degree of the Hadith about Salat al-Hajah The hadeeth narrated concerning Salat al-Hajah says: “From ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa al-Aslami, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out to us and said: ‘Whoever has need of something from Allah or any one of His creation, let him do wudu’ and pray two rak’ahs, then let him say, “There is no god but Allah, the Forbearing, the Most Generous. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the mighty Throne. Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah, I ask You for Your mercy and forgiveness and I ask You for all good things and for safety from all sins. I ask You not to leave any sin without forgiving it, or any distress without relieving it, or any need which it pleases You to fulfil without fulfilling it for me.” Then let him ask Allah for whatever matter of this world or the Hereafter that he wishes, for it will be fulfilled.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, Iqamat al-Salah wa’l-Sunnah, 1374) Al-Tirmdihi said: “This is a ghareeb [strange] hadeeth, and concerning its isnad it was said: Faid ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman is weak in hadith. Al-Albani said: rather it is da’if jiddan (very weak). Al-Hakim said: mawdu’ (fabricated) ahadith were narrated from Abu Awfa. (Mishkat al-Masabih, vol. 1, p. 417) The author of al-Sunan wa’l-Mubtada’at said, after mentioning what al-Tirmidhi said concerning Faid ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman: Ahmad said he is matruk (left, i.e., his hadith is not to be accepted), and Ibn al-‘Arabi described him as da’if (weak). And he said: “You know what is said concerning this hadith. It is better and more perfect and safer for you to make du'a’ to Allah in the depths of the night and between the adhan and iqamah and at the end of every prayer before the taslim; and on Fridays, for then there are times when dua’ is answered; and when breaking one’s fast. For your Lord says (interpretation of the meanings): ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation)’ [Fussilat 40:60] ‘And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor)’ [al-Baqarah 2:186] ‘And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them’ [al-A'raf 7:180].” (Al-Sunan wa’l-Mubtada’at by al-Shuqayri, p. 124)"
227,Baseless Report About Times of Eating and Drinking Being ‘Awrah,"Question “Eating and drinking are two ‘awrahs (times of exposure/weakness) , so cover them.” Is this a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration)?","Praise be to Allah. After looking for this hadeeth in the books of Sunnah (prophetic traditions), we could not find any basis for it. This hadeeth was not even mentioned by the scholars who compiled collections of weak and fabricated hadeeths. Perhaps it is one of the false hadeeths that were fabricated in recent times. The meaning indicated by the hadeeth has no basis in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Eating and drinking are not among the ‘awrahs which must be covered. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to eat with his Companions, so how can eating and drinking be ‘awrah? And Allah knows best."
228,Attitude towards fitnah,Question I have heard that there is a certain attitude that the Muslim should adopt if he faces a time of fitnah (tribulation). What is the attitude towards fitnah?.,"Praise be to Allah.There is a certain attitude which the Muslim should adopt towards fitnah to that this fitnah will not have a negative effect on him, and so that he will not have a negative effect on the Muslim community. This attitude includes the following: (a) Deliberation, gentleness, forbearance and not being hasty Deliberation, gentleness and forbearance at times of tribulation and upheaval are praiseworthy traits, because they enable the Muslim to see things as they really are and to understand what is going on. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no gentleness in a thing but it adorns it, and the absence of gentleness in anything makes it ugly.” Narrated by Muslim, 4698. And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Ashajj ‘Abdul Qays: “You have two characteristics which Allaah loves, forbearance and deliberation.” Narrated by Muslim, 24. So we must all be gentle in our thinking and attitudes, and with regard to all events that occur, and we should not be hasty, because that is not the way of the Muslim ummah, especially at times of fitnah. (b) – Sabr (patience) We need a great deal of patience, especially at times of fitnah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As- Saabiroon (the patient). Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: “Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.” They are those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones” [al-Baqarah 2:155-157] It was narrated from Abu Tha’labah al-Khushani that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “After you there will come the days of patience (i.e., days which require patience). Patience during those (days) will be like grasping a live coal. During those (days) the reward for the one who adheres to the commands of Allaah will be equivalent to the reward of fifty men who did an action like his.” He said, “O Messenger of Allaah, the reward of fifty of them?” He said, “The reward of fifty of you.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4341; Ibn Maajah, 4014. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Saheehah, 494. With patience, the difference between those who are determined and confident and those who are cowardly and weak becomes apparent. Hence the righteous salaf understood the importance of patience at times of tribulation and new developments. There follow some examples from their life stories: When the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) were being persecuted and tested at the beginning of Islam in Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would pass by them and remind them to be patient. When he passed by the family of Yaasir he would say, “Patience, O family of Yaasir, for you are promised Paradise.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Takhreej Fiqh al-Seerah, p. 103. It was narrated that al-Zubayr ibn ‘Adiyy said: We came to Anas ibn Maalik and complained to him about what we were suffering from al-Hajjaaj. He said, “Be patient, for there never comes to you a time but what follows it is worse, until you meet your Lord. I heard this from your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7068. Al-Mustawrid al-Qurashi said to ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘The Hour will begin when the Romans are the greatest people in number.’” ‘Amr said, “Watch what you say!” He said, “I am saying what I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” He said, “If you say that, it is a fact, for they have four qualities. They are the most patient of people at times of tribulation; they recover quickly from calamity; they are quick to recover and attack again after defeat; and they are good to the poor, orphans and the weak. And a fifth good quality that they have is that they resist the oppression of kings.” Narrated by Muslim, 2889. Al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: “If there is nothing left in the world but trials and tribulation, then face the trials with patience.” When the imam of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, faced the overwhelming fitnah of those who said that the Qur’aan was created, during the reigns of al-Mu’moon, al-Mu’tasim and al-Waathiq, when he was subjected to lengthy imprisonment and severe beatings, he bore that with patience and adhered to his religion, the straight path, until Allaah granted him victory and relieved him of that distress. (c) Justice and fairness in all things One of the strongest causes of differences among people, especially at times of fitnah, is the lack of justice and fairness. If the Muslim strives to become fair to himself and to other people, then many of the problems that arise among Muslims, whether on the individual or communal level, will be solved, in sha Allah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whenever you give your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth” [al-An’aam 6:152] “and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety” [al-Maa’idah 5:8] So it is essential to be just in our words and deeds, especially at times of fitnah, in the sense that we should examine each matter and note its good and bad aspects, weigh them up, and then pass judgement, because examining matters thoroughly will protect the Muslim from attributing to Islam things that are not in accordance with the commands of Allaah. So your justice and fairness at the time of fitnah will save you, in sha Allah. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: I urge you, my brothers, to be just and balanced in all things, to look at all issues surrounding any given matter, to find out the more correct ruling concerning it, and to judge all matters in the same way. This is an important principle which the wise man must follow in his relationship with Allaah and in his relationship with other people, to be fair, for Allaah loves those who are fair. There follow some examples from the lives of our righteous forebears (the salaf) of their keenness to be just and fair: Muslim (1828) narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Shimaasah said: I came to ‘Aa’ishah and asked her about something, and she said, “Where are you from?” I said, “I am from Egypt.” She said, “What was the behaviour of your governor towards you in this war of yours?” I said: “We did not experience anything bad from him. If the camel of one of our men died, he would give him another camel. If any one of us lost his slave, he would give him another slave. If anybody was in need of the basic necessities of life, he would provide them with provisions.” She said: “The treatment that was meted out to my brother, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, does not prevent me from telling you what I heard from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said in this house of mine: ‘O Allaah, whoever gains some kind of control over the affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains some kind of control over the affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.’” Al-Nawawi said, commenting on this hadeeth: This indicates that we should mention the virtues of good people, and not refrain from doing so because we dislike them etc. They differed concerning the way in which this Muhammad was killed. It was said that he was killed in battle, and that he was killed as a prisoner of war after the battle… The governor in question here was Mu’aawiyah ibn Hudayj who killed Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. Al-Siyar, 3/38. And Allaah knows best."
229,Can she sponsor her brother to come and live in Canada even though he is not religiously committed?,"Question I live in XXX and I came here with my husband as immigrant. My youngest brother (26 years old and married) wants to come to XXX and he wants me to sponsor him. At present he is not a good practising Muslim. I would like to know if I sponsor my brother, then he comes to XXX in future and he does not follow Islam properly, will it be a sin for me? Please let me know in the light of Quran and hadith?.","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to live in a non-Muslim country on condition that one is able to practice Islam openly and live according to its teachings whilst being safe from fitnah (temptation). This means that the person who lives there should be religiously committed in such a way that will protect him from doubts and desires. See the answer to questions no. 13363 and 111564. Based on that, if you fear that your brother may succumb to fitnah because he is not religiously committed, then it is not permissible for you to help him to come to that country, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. If you hope that he will become righteous and that you can help him and protect him from corruption, and there is a purpose to be served or a harm to be warded off by bringing him to that country, then there is nothing wrong with sponsoring him and helping him. And Allah knows best."
230,What is the ruling on fasting with the intention of fasting both for medical reasons and fasting in the Islamic sense?,"Question There is something called “water fasting” where you only drink water for a couple of days. This can be from 3 days to 10 days or even more. It is known to have many health benefits. Does this go under continual fasting if I intend to do this fast religiously by only drinking water (no food) for sahur and iftar? Is it permissible? Also, since bowel movements are disrupted during this fast, doing enema is recommended every few days. Is this permissible? I would like to add that I do not have any health problem, I just want to gain the health benefits this fast has to offer.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Combining the intention of seeking reward for fasting and of achieving health benefits If someone fasts for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted, and at the same time also intends to attain the health benefits of fasting, there is nothing wrong with that. Seeking permissible benefits does not invalidate an act of worship, just as Allah, may He be exalted, has permitted the pilgrim to engage in trade and seek the provision of Allah during his Hajj journey. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Hajj is [during] well-known months, so whoever has made hajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of ihram], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during hajj. And whatever good you do - Allah knows it. And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of Allah. And fear Me, O you of understanding There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord [during hajj]. But when you depart from 'Arafat, remember Allah at al- Mash‘ar al-Haram. And remember Him, as He has guided you, for indeed, you were before that among those astray} [al-Baqarah 2:197-198]. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Dhu’l-Majaaz and ‘Ukaaz were markets that were held during the Jaahiliyyah. When Islam came, it was as if they had reservations about that, until the words were revealed: {There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord [during hajj]}. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1770), who included it in a chapter entitled: Chapter on trade during the days of Hajj and buying and selling in the markets of the Jaahiliyyah. Similarly it is permissible for a young man to fast with the intention of suppressing and reducing his desire. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us: “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one’s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it should fast, for it will weaken his desire.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5066) and Muslim (1400). For more information, please see the answer to question no. 220996 . But the one who fasts should make worship his main focus, and not the opposite, as has been explained previously in the answer to question no. 228454 . Secondly: What is the continuous fasting that is not allowed? The continuous fasting that is not allowed is when the fasting person continues to fast night and day for a number of days, without eating or drinking, and without eating sahoor or iftar. If the fasting person has iftar or sahoor, even if it is only water, then he is not regarding as fasting continuously. Please see the answer to question no. 37757 . As this is the case, then fasting in the sense of refraining from eating food and drinking only water is not a type of fasting that is prescribed in Islam at all, let alone being a kind of continual fasting, because there is no fasting in this case, so long as one is drinking water. But it should be noted that refraining from eating food in this manner, even though it does not come under the heading of continual fasting, if it leads to falling short in obligatory duties, such as feeling too lazy to offer the five daily prayers, or it leads to falling short in doing one’s duties to other people, such as falling short in doing one’s job, then this kind of refraining from eating or “fasting” is not allowed. If it is done for a real medical need, and it will not prevent one from carrying out Islamic duties or duties towards other people that outweigh the interest served by this “fasting”, as is done by some religiously committed people, then it is not disallowed. But one should bear in mind what has been noted above, that this is not a real fast (sawm) and one cannot draw closer to Allah by doing such things. Rather it comes under the heading of medical treatment and remedies, like other kinds of medical treatment. Thirdly: Ruling on doing an enema when fasting The scholars differed regarding the ruling on doing an enema when fasting and whether it invalidates the fast or not. The view that is more likely to be correct is that it does not invalidate the fast. This has been discussed previously in a number of answers. Please see the answers to questions no. 38023 and 37749 . This ruling has nothing to do with the one who is refraining from eating food only, because he is not fasting in the Islamic sense, so if he has a medical need for an enema, there is no reason not to do it. And Allah knows best."
231,Is Iblees the father of all the jinn?,"Question Is Iblees the father of all Jinn, evil and righteous ones, or a father for only the evil Jinn?.","Praise be to Allah. The devils (shayaateen) are the kuffaar of the jinn. Allaah, may He be exalted, says of the accursed Iblees (interpretation of the meaning): “except Iblees (Satan). He was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the Command of his Lord” [al-Kahf 18:50]. Many scholars are of the view that Iblees is the father of all of the jinn, both the believing and disbelieving ones among them. He is their origin and they are his offspring. This view was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid, Qataadah, al-Hasan al-Basri and others. See: Tafseer al-Tabari (1/507) and al-Durr al-Manthoor (5/402). There is a hadeeth concerning that which is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Awsat (6/197) from Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam al-Sulami. But it is very weak (da’eef jiddan), as it was narrated only by Talhah ibn Zayd al-Qurashi of whom ‘Ali ibn al-Madeeni said: He used to fabricate hadeeth. See: Tahdheeb al-Tahdheeb (5/16). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah called Iblees the father of the jinn in more than one place (see Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 4/346, 235), as did his student Ibn al-Qayyim, then al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (6/369). Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (9/370-371): The shaytaan is the father of the jinn according to a number of scholars. He is the one who disobeyed his Lord and was too proud to prostrate to Adam, so Allaah expelled him and cast him away. End quote. It says in Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (al-Jinn wa’l-Shayaateen, question no. 2) : Undoubtedly Iblees is the father of the jinn, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning) : “And the jinn He created from a smokeless flame of fire” [al-Rahmaan 55:15] And He describes Iblees when he addressed the Lord of Glory (may He be glorified and exalted) (interpretation of the meaning) : “ ‘I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay’” [al-A’raaf 7:12] And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Will you then take him (Iblees) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you?” [al-Kahf 18:50] This evidence clearly indicates that Iblees has offspring and that the jinn are his offspring, but how did that come about? This is something of which we have no knowledge and it is something concerning which it does not matter if we are ignorant, and knowing it does not bring any benefit. And Allaah knows best. End quote. For more information please see the answer to question no. 13378. And Allaah knows best."
232,Is it permissible to read books that speak about intercourse for one who is about to get married?,"Question Is it permissible for a person who is about to get married for the first time to read some books in order to learn how to be intimate with his wife, so long as the books do not contain any pictures?.","Praise be to Allah.There are many reservations about reading books in order to find out how to have intercourse, such as the following: 1.It may provoke desires in you that you cannot fulfil in any permissible way. This is a problem that is not farfetched, especially for one who does not have a wife to turn to. 2.Most of these books teach perverse forms of intercourse. Some of them go against the fitrah and sound human nature and others go against sharee’ah, such as anal intercourse. 3.Reading about these kinds of intercourse may put a man off his wife who does not do these kinds of actions well, and he may become attached to those things and the people who do them. 4.Reading these books may make you want to know more, and the devils among mankind and the jinn may lead you to read books which contain pictures, and you will end up doing something that is against sharee’ah. 5.Reading them encourages you to buy them, which helps to propagate them and encourages the printing of more editions. 6.There is no guarantee that these books will not fall into the hands of people who will be encouraged by them to do haraam actions. Your situation as one who wants to learn as a preparation for marriage is not like that of others who may get their hands on these books. Moreover, Allaah has created in the male an inclination towards the female; having intercourse with a woman is not something complicated that needs a lot of explanation. A man will know what to do instinctively. If he needs any help the way to get this information is usually from the closest of people to him, or the most sincere among brothers who are already married. Hence there is no need for these books. And there may be other reservations. Hence we do not think that you should read these kinds of books. That does not mean that you should not learn about the permissible way of having intercourse. But what we have mentioned is that you should not read what has been written by those who are far removed from Islam, good taste and a sound human nature. You can read about married life and intercourse in the context of shar’i rulings and advice, that is free of the reservations we have referred to, on this site under the heading of “Married life.” This is in the category on Marriage. And Allaah knows best."
233,Ruling on the imam standing on the far left of the musalla and ruling on the worshippers near him standing on his right,"Question We pray in a small musalla (prayer room) in the hospital, during work hours. Because the musalla is so small, the imam stands on the far left, and the worshippers all stand on his right, in line with him. Is this permissible? Or is it more correct for the imam to stand in the middle of row, among the worshippers. Can he stand in line with the worshippers if they pray on his right and his left, or should he be in front of them, if only slightly?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The Sunnah is for the imam to stand in front of the worshippers, because this is what is proven in the Sunnah. Ibn Abi ‘Umar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Sunnah is for the worshippers to stand behind the imam. If there are a number of worshippers, the Sunnah is for them to stand behind the imam, whether they are men or women, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to lead his companions in prayer and they stood behind him. When Jaabir and Jabbaar stood on his right and left, he pushed them until they were behind him, even though they were two. Similarly, Jaabir narrated: I travelled with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a campaign. He stood up to pray, and I did wudoo’, then I came and stood on his left. He took me by the hand and pulled me around until he made me stand on his right. Then Jabbaar ibn Sakhr came and stood on his left, and he took both of us by the hand and made us stand behind him. Narrated by Abu Dawood. This is also the view of ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Jaabir ibn Zayd, al-Hasan, Maalik, ash-Shaafa‘i, and ashaab ar-ra’y. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Kabeer (2/61) In the answer to question no. 66017 we explained that it is mustahabb for the imam to stand in the middle of the row. Secondly: If the worshippers stand on the right of the imam, their prayer is valid, but if the imam stands in the middle of the row and they stand behind him, that is preferable. Al-Bahooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the worshippers stand with the imam, on his right, or they stand on both sides of him, that is valid. End quote from Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/486) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is valid for them to stand with the imam, on his right or on both sides of him. That is, if there are two or more worshippers, they may stand on his left or on either side of him, one on his right and the other on his left. That is preferable to them being on his right only, because ‘Abdullah in Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) stood between ‘Alqamah and al-Aswad, and he said: This is what I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) do. So if there are two worshippers or more with the imam, there are three ways they may stand: 1.behind him, which is the best 2.on either side of him 3.on his right hand side only. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (4/264) Thirdly: If they pray on his right, and it is possible for the imam to step forward, even a little bit, to indicate who the imam is, and so that no one will stand ahead of the imam, this is the Sunnah; the evidence for it has been mentioned above. Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled Chapter: He should stand on the right of the imam, in line with him, if they are two. Imam Badr ad-Deen al-‘Ayni al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If they are two, i.e., the imam and the one who is praying behind him – and it is limited to that, because if it is two worshippers with an imam , the ruling is that the imam should step forward. End quote from ‘Umdat al-Qaari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari (8/404) But if they form a straight line with the imam, their prayer is still valid, and is not makrooh, because there is an excuse. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Sometimes we are in the trench and it is narrow, so the imam cannot stand in front of us to lead the prayer; rather we make him stand in the middle of the first row. Is that valid? If it is not valid, then where is the correct place for him to stand? Please note that if we pray outside, we may be shelled and die. He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: It is Sunnah for the imam to stand in front of the worshippers, but if that is not possible because the place is cramped, then there is nothing wrong with him standing with them in the middle of the row. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il ash-Shaykh (15/185) And Allah knows best."
234,Buying magazines and catalogs in order to take women’s fashions from them,"Question What is the ruling on buying catalogues of the western clothes, in order to buy through them and avoid going to markets? Knowing that these catalogues contain men and women in underwear only (almost naked)! So what is the ruling on this? Is it permissible for a woman to look at another woman who is only in underwear, For the purpose of buying? I hope you give me a detailed convincing answer.","Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible to buy the catalogues mentioned, because they contain indecent images which it is not permissible for a man or a woman to look at. It is well known that the ‘awrah of a man before other men, and the ‘awrah of a woman before other women, is the area between the navel and the knee. These images include uncovering of the ‘awrah as you say, and this is in addition to the fitnah and evil which may be caused by them for the men, women or children who look at them. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: What is the ruling on buying magazines in which there are images of women so as to take ideas for designs that may be in accordance with our sharee’ah and ignoring those that go against it? They replied: It is not permissible for you to buy these magazines in which there are images of different styles because of the fitnah contained in these magazines and because by buying them you are helping them to continue to produce these harmful images. You should be content to wear the clothes that women in your country wear. And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (13/75). It also says (1/468): As for the indecent pictures that are found in the magazines, it is not permissible to buy them or bring them into the house, because of the negative consequences that outweigh the benefit sought – if there is any benefit – otherwise the matter is more forbidden. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “That which is halaal is clear and that which is haraam is clear, and between them are doubtful matters which many people do not know. Whoever avoids the doubtful matters will have protected his religious commitment and his honour, but whoever falls into the doubtful matters will fall into haraam, like a shepherd who grazes his flock around a sanctuary and soon will transgress upon it. Every king has a sanctuary and the sanctuary of Allaah is His sacred limits.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man who came and asked him about righteousness: “Righteousness is that with which your heart and soul feels at ease, and sin is that which wavers in the heart and you feel hesitant about it, even if people advise you to do it.” Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on buying books which contain pictures. He replied: Books which contain pictures may be divided into two categories: those who are made for the purpose of the pictures, such as that Burda magazine, which it is not permissible to buy or keep, because the purpose behind it is the pictures; and another kind which is not made for the purpose of the pictures, rather it is aimed at some useful purpose, but it may contain a picture of the person who wrote the article. There is nothing wrong with keeping these, because it is too difficult to avoid them, and because it is also too difficult to go through them and erase all the pictures. And it is permissible to sell them because if it is permissible to use them it is permissible to sell them. End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab il-Maftooh (21/115). And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: I warn you against bringing these magazines and journals that are filled with attractive images, misleading words and deviant fashions, into your homes and letting your families get their hands on them, for you will destroy them and ruin their morals and values. Everything that is shown in these magazines and journals will have an effect on those who look at them and read the ideas mentioned in them. O believers, keeping these magazines and journals in your homes will prevent the angels from entering them, because the angels do not enter any house in which there is an image. What do you think of a house that the angels do not enter? Keeping such magazines is haraam, buying them is haraam, selling them is haraam, making money from them is haraam, accepting them as a gift is haraam, and everything that helps to publish them among the Muslims is haraam, because it is cooperating in sin and transgression, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. Fear Allaah, O slaves of Allaah, and beware of keeping these magazines and journals; burn them for proof is established by what you have heard. Burn these magazines and destroy them; do not leave them in the hands of your wives or sons or daughters. Beware of spending money on them or subscribing to them, for that involves many evils, such as wasting money that Allaah has given to people to spend on their religious and worldly interests, and wasting money on something that is of no benefit, or on something that may be harmful. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wasting money. End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah (4/381). And Allaah knows best."
235,Eating out of forgetfulness in Ramadan does not matter,Question What is the ruling on one who eats or drinks out of forgetfulness during Ramadan?,"Praise be to Allah.That does not matter and his fast is valid, because Allah says at the end of Soorat al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286] It was narrated in a saheeh report from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Allah said, “I have done that.” And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for the One Who fed him and gave him to drink was Allah.” (Agreed upon). The same applies if he has intercourse because of forgetfulness; his fast is still valid according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of this aayah and this hadeeth, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever breaks his fast in Ramadaan out of forgetfulness, he does not have to make that day up and he does not have to offer any expiation (kafaarah).” (Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim). This wording includes intercourse and other things that break the fast, if the fasting person does them because of forgetfulness. This is from the mercy, bounty and kindness of Allah, for which we praise and thank Him."
236,Is it permissible to deal with ribaa in a ribaa-based society?,Question Is it permissible for the Muslim to deal with ribaa in a society that is based on ribaa?,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for him to deal with ribaa, even if the society is based on ribaa, because of the general applicability of the texts which forbid ribaa. He has to change this evil action as much as he can, if he cannot move away from that society in order to distance himself from this evil, lest the punishment that befalls them befalls him too. And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."
237,"The believer is in a state between fear and hope until he meets Allah, may He be exalted","Question Allah says in the hadith qudsi: “I am as My slave thinks I am, so let him think of Me whatever he wishes.” And that there is something that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “If one of my feet was in Paradise and the other was outside of it, I would not feel safe from the plan of Allah.” Was Sayyiduna ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) not thinking positively of Allah, when he was one of those who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, and he was the second greatest of the Companions of the Prophet after Sayyiduna Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him)? Is it possible that a person could feel assured, yet also fear the plan of Allah? I hope that you can explain clearly what the connection is between ‘Umar’s words and the hadith.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Al-Bukhari (7405) and Muslim (2675) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted, says: I am as My slave thinks I am.” The hadith in the version mentioned in the question was narrated by Imam Ahmad (16016) and others, from Sulayman – who is ibn Abi’s-Sa’ib – who said: Hayyan Abu’n-Nadr told me: Wathilah ibn al-Asqa‘ and I went to visit Abu’l-Aswad al- Jurashi during his final illness. He greeted him with salaam and sat down, and Abu’l-Aswad took hold of Wathilah’s right hand and wiped over his eyes and face with it, because he had sworn allegiance with it to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Then Wathilah said to him: I want to ask you one thing. He said: What is it? He said: What do you think of your Lord? Abu’l-Aswad nodded – meaning that he thought well of Him. Wathilah said: Be of good cheer, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says: I am as My slave thinks I am, so let him think of Me whatever he wishes.” The commentators on al-Musnad said: Its isnad is sahih. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami‘. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said: What is meant by thinking positively of Allah, may He be exalted, is thinking that He will show him mercy and pardon him. They said: When a person is in good health, he should have hope and fear in equal measure. And it was said that the level of fear should be greater, then when the signs of impending death appear, he should increase his hope, or only have hope, because the purpose of fear is to make a person restrain himself from committing sins and abhorrent deeds, and make him keen to do a great deal of acts of worship and righteous deeds, but it may not be possible to do that or do most of it in this state, so it is recommended to think positively of Allah, as well as showing humility and submission to Allah, may He be exalted.""(Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim 17/210). See also the answer the question no. 150516 . Imam Ahmad (9076) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says: ‘I am as My slave thinks I am. If he thinks positively of Me, that will be good for him, and if he thinks negatively of Me, that will be bad for him.” It was classed as sahih by the commentators on al-Musnad. Al-Minnawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is: if he thinks positively of Me, he will find good consequences, and if he thinks negatively of Me, he will find bad consequences.”""(Fayd al-Qadir 2/312). So the Muslim must think positively of his Lord, by striving to do good and turning to Allah, and if he does something bad, he should think positively of Allah by repenting without delay and hoping that Allah will forgive him and pardon him. Secondly: Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Then did they feel secure from the plan of Allah? But no one feels secure from the plan of Allah except the losing people} [Al-A‘raf 7:99]. Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant here is a warning to people not to feel safe from the plan of Allah by continuing to disobey Him and neglect His rights. What is meant by Allah’s plan for them is His letting them get carried away and granting them more delights and good things whilst they continue to disobey Him and go against His commands. Thus they deserve to be brought to account for their heedlessness and punished for their negligence, because they continued to disobey Him and felt safe from His punishment and wrath.""(Majmoo‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz 24/232). He also said: What is required of the Muslim is not to despair of mercy and not to feel safe from punishment; rather they should be in a state between hope and fear, because Allah has condemned those who feel safe from punishment and has condemned those who despair of His mercy, as He, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Then did they feel secure from the plan of Allah? But no one feels secure from the plan of Allah except the losing people} [Al-A‘raf 7:99] {do not despair of the mercy of Allah} [Az-Zumar 39:53]. So what the accountable person, male or female, must do is not despair and not give up and not stop striving; rather he must be in a state between hope and fear, fearing Allah and avoiding sin, hastening to repent and ask Allah for pardon, and he should not feel secure from the plan of Allah and persist in sin and heedlessness.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb by Ibn Baz 4/38). Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Hence al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The believer strives to do acts of worship and righteous deeds when he is concerned, worried and afraid, whereas the evildoer commits sins yet still feels safe from the punishment of Allah.""(Tafseer Ibn Kathir 3/451). Thirdly: With regard to what some people narrate from Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) – and others narrate from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) – that he said: “If one of my feet was in Paradise and the other was outside of it, I would not feel safe from the plan of Allah”, we could not find any source for it in books of the scholars of hadith, and we do not know any of the scholars who mentioned it. Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about it and he said: I am not familiar with it. End quote. These words – after establishing that they are not soundly narrated – are subject to further discussion. The believer does not feel safe from the plan of Allah so long as he has not entered Paradise, then once his feet step into Paradise, he will be safe from the plan of Allah. It is not known that anyone would step with one of his feet into Paradise, then Allah would take him out of it and admit him to Hell. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: When will a person feel secure and at ease? He said: With the first step he takes into Paradise.""(Tabaqat al-Hanabilah 1/293). And Allah knows best."
238,Zakah on Trade Goods and Shop Fittings,"Question I have a shop in which there is equipment worth 80,000 riyals, and there are people who owe the shop debts totalling 80,000 riyals. There was a fire in the shop 6 months ago and new merchandise has been and renovations have been done, which together add up to 40,000, of which 35,000 has been borrowed in the name of the shop, to be paid back in instalments. My first question is: should we pay zakah on the total amount of equipment that was in the store before the fire? Total cost + debts – new stock and renovation. My second question is: A full year has not yet passed since the renovations; should we pay zakah on it or only on the whole shop and the debts that we are owed?","Praise be to Allah.Types of goods in shops The goods that are found in a shop fall into two categories: Those that are prepared for sale, whether they are real estate, food, clothes, or other kinds of goods that are sold. Those that are not prepared for sale, rather they are for producing goods or are to be used, such as manufacturing equipment , cars, furniture, cameras and computers, etc. The first category are those that are called “trade goods” and these are the ones on which zakah must be paid. As for the second category, they are known as fixed assets, and no zakah is due on them. In the answer to question no. 42072 , we stated that it is obligatory to pay zakah on trade goods, and we explained the nisab (minimum threshold), and the fact that fixtures that are not prepared for sale are not subject to zakah. In the answer to question no. 22449 , we explained that it is permissible to pay zakah on trade goods in kind , and that it does not have to be paid in cash . For information on how to calculate zakah on trade goods , please see the answer to question no. 26236 , in which it explains that zakah is to be paid on the sale price , not the purchase price. Zakah on trade good In conclusion, if the time for paying zakah on your shop has come, then you should take stock of what you have in the shop, such as the goods that you have there, and add them to whatever you have of cash, and add that total to the debts that you hope will be paid back, then pay zakah on the total at a rate of one-quarter of one-tenth. As for the debts which you have no hope that they will be paid back because they are owed by people who delay payment or who are poor, then no zakah is due on them until you take possession of them and start to reckon a new year from the day you receive them. In order to be on the safe side, when you receive them, pay zakah for one year only, even if several years have passed. Please see question no. 1346 . The debts that you owe are not to be deducted from the wealth on which you have to pay zakah, according to the more correct scholarly view. See question no. 22426 . Zakah on lost goods The goods that were lost in the fire are not to be added to the total of goods in the store. As for the things that you put in the store after the fire, if they have to do with furnishings, décor and fixtures, then as we have stated above, no zakah is due on them, so they should not be included among the goods in the store that are subject to zakah. If they are goods that are for sale, then if you bought them with the shop’s funds and profits, then zakah should be paid on them when you pay zakah for the shop’s goods even if one year has not yet passed. If you bought them with other money that does not belong to the store, then you should count one year from the time when you acquired the wealth with which you bought them. We ask Allah to compensate you with good and to bless you with a goodly provision. For more, please see this category: Zakaah on trade goods And Allah knows best."
239,Renting Cars or Properties in Rent-to-Own Contract,"Question Here in Tunisia there are many companies which call themselves rent-to-own companies. Their services are based on buying the item that the customer wants (such as cars or properties) and registering it in the name of the company, then it rents it to the customer for a previously agreed-upon amount of money, for a limited time, as defined in the contract, which will end in the sale of the item. Please note that interest is charged, and the one to whom the item is rented does not receive money in his hand; rather the company buys the thing in its own name, and ownership is not transferred to the customer until after he has paid the last installment, as agreed in the rental contract. Is doing this transaction Islamically permissible, or does it come under the heading of implicit Riba?","Praise be to Allah.Forbidden forms of rent-to-own contracts What you have mentioned comes under the heading of what is called rent-to-own , of which there are some forms that are permissible and others that are prohibited. If the company rents out the car , for example, to the customer for a particular period, then ownership of the car is transferred to the customer automatically, without drawing up a new contract, so that the rental contract, at the end of the stipulated period, automatically turns into a sale contract, then this kind of transaction is prohibited. The same applies if the company draws up a rental contract with the customer, and a sale contract at the same time. This is not permissible, because two contradictory contracts cannot be combined for the same item at the same time. Permissible forms of rent-to-own contracts As for the permissible ways of doing that, one of them is a rental contract that may be accompanied with a promise to sell, then when the rental period ends, the two parties draw up a new contract of sale on the basis of whatever price they agree on. This is permissible. Another form is when the rental contract is accompanied by a contract giving the item (the car, for example) as a gift, on condition that the full rental amount is paid, or it may be accompanied by a promise to give it as a gift after payment of the full amount of rent. This is permissible. Conditions of rent-to-own contracts In all permissible forms of this transaction it is stipulated that the rent should be real, and it should not be a cover-up for a sale. So the liability for the rented item – that is, a car or property – is to be borne by the one who is renting it out (the company), not by the renter or tenant. The same applies to maintenance expenditure; it is to be borne by the one who is renting it out, not by the renter, for the duration of the rental contract, in contrast to a sales contract, in which liability and maintenance costs are all to be borne by the purchaser, because he takes possession of the item when the sales contract is drawn up. It says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah (2/286): “It is not permissible to stipulate that the renter should cover the costs of maintenance, because that makes the amount of rent ambiguous. Therefore the rental contract is rendered invalid if this condition is stipulated, according to the consensus of all Schools of Fiqh.” A statement was issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council regarding rent-to-own contracts, which discussed the permissible and prohibited forms of such contracts. We have quoted that in the answer to question no. 97625 . If the company stipulates a down payment in advance , to be deducted from the rent, there is nothing wrong with that, but it is not permissible for the company to keep the down payment if the renter does not complete the rental period, except for the period that remains outstanding only. Our advice is to take a picture or make a copy of the company’s contract and show it to specialists. And Allah knows best."
240,Is there a set rate of profit in business?,"Question Is there a set rate of profit in business, or is profit unlimited? We would like an answer to this question with evidence. Please do not forget the many taxes that a businessman pays every year.","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the one who buys a product for trading or to keep, to sell it for more than he bought it for, for cash or on credit. We do not know of any limit on profit, but one should be easygoing, because there are reports which encourage that. But if the product is known locally to be of a certain price, a Muslim should not sell it for more to one who is unaware of that, without telling him of this fact, because selling it for more is a kind of deceit. The Muslim is the brother of his fellow-Muslim and he should not wrong him, abandon him, cheat him or betray him, rather he should advise him sincerely wherever he is. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. And in al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Yamaani said: “I swore allegiance to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), pledging to establish prayer, pay zakaah and be sincere towards every Muslim.” End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth il-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’ (13/89). It also says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: Profits in business are not limited, rather they depend on supply and demand, plenty and scarcity. But it is good for the Muslim, whether he is a trader or otherwise, to be easygoing in buying and selling, and not to take advantage of his companion’s negligence in order to deceive him when buying or selling. Rather he should pay attention to the rights of Islamic brotherhood. End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’ (13/91)."
241,How to Safeguard the Islam of Newly Reverted Sister,"Question I would like to thank the founders and the workers on this web site because it helped me and is still helping me a lot. I embraced Islam three years ago (Al-hamdulillah), and from that time on I worked to convince my family members and my close friends to submit to it. My little sister (15 years old) who was watching me for the past three years grew in her belief and eventually uttered the Shahada (testimony of faith) one week ago ( Al-hamdulillah). Now my concern is, how can I protect her faith; how can I help her to strengthen it? I feel she might lose her faith any time because the environment we are living in encourages people to go astray. In addition to that, my parents still don’t know about her conversion, I’m sure that if they knew they would not be pleased with it and they would try to get her back to Judaism. Please, I need your advice, I really don’t know how to deal with this situation.","Praise be to Allah. First: From that which makes a Muslim happy is his seeing people enter into the true religion of Allah, the Exalted and leaving their false and distorted religions. We’d like to congratulate you on having been chosen by Allah for Islam and then for being granted the ability to call towards the guidance which resulted in the Islam of your sister and her being saved from the wrath and punishment of Allah. This takes our minds back to the glorious companion, Abdullah ibn Salam, who was a Jew and who entered Islam and perfected his Islam. We ask Allah, the Exalted, to keep you and your sister firm and to grant you the strength and ability to attain beneficial knowledge and work righteous deeds. Second: From that which we advise you to do with your sister who entered Islam in order to help keep her firmly upon the religions is the following: 1.Encourage her to recite and to listen to Quran a great deal. It would be nice if you could assist in selecting recitations of recitors whose voices are pleasing to the listeners. 2.Make available to her small but highly beneficial Islamic books which contain simplified Islamic rulings and the biographies of great Islamic scholars and leaders. It would be preferred if they contained biographies of female scholars, callers and warriors. 3.Make every effort to keep her away from bad company, especially those friends which she had before Islam and who had an impact on her due to their strong personalities or gentleness. Be gentle while doing this so as not to turn her away from you and have her more attached to her friends. 4.Make easily accessible to her touching audio materials which talk about Islamic issues and the fate of man after death and the hereafter. 5.Encourage her to regularly praise and thank Allah, the Exalted, for the blessing of guidance. Through gratitude, blessings last and every slave requires of his Lord, the Exalted, to assist him, strengthen him and keep him firm upon his religion. 6.Encourage her to pray regularly and on time while giving the prayer its due by carrying out its necessary and compulsory actions in the best manner and urge her to supplicate abundantly during the prostration. 7.Be sure to tell her not to reveal her reversion to Islam to her family at this time out of fear that they will influence her negatively and cause her harm in her religion. See the answers to the two questions 33827 and 69752. 8.The fact that you were able to influence her and she accepted Islam after observing you shows that she respects you and has love for you. Therefore, try to be her best friend and the rock she can lean on. Try your best to give her all the moral support you can; continue being a good example for her, let her talk to you and share her thoughts with you and let her feel that you are there for her whenever she needs you. Insha Allah your companionship and support will be a positive influence on her. 9.It goes without saying that perhaps one of the most effective means (if not the most effective) is for you to regularly and consistently supplicate to Allah (du’aa) for her. Everything is in Allah’s Hands and He is the One Who controls the hearts, therefore, implore Him to keep your sister firm upon the truth. 10.Gently try to help your sister find a new set of friends who will be supportive and act as good role models. We ask Allah to keep you both firm upon His religion and to grant you success in pleasing Him. Thank you for taking the time to benefit from our site. May Allah grant you beneficial knowledge and the ability to act according to it."
242,Obedience to Allah Brings Provision,"Question I am thirty years old. I was sinning till five years ago, yet I was praying. Then I got married and travelled to France. Many problems happened to me and I found that the only solution is to return to Allah and repent. So I repented, all praise be to Allah. I started memorising the Quran and seeking Islamic knowledge. I fast the optional fasting throughout the year, I do not miss any prayer in the masjid except rarely; I do not miss the first takbeerah (opening) of any salah (formal prayer) for forty days. All praise be to Allah as He should be praised. As a result of this, my circumstances improved a lot, and I felt a very big positive change in myself as well. The more I obey, the more Allah blesses me, Allah is watching, He knows I am truthful. The problem is that I do not know why I am exerting effort in worship; is it for the gain of the hereafter or for worldly benefits? If I give in charity for example, I am not sure if I am really seeking the pure reward or because I know that Allah will bless me with much more than what I gave in charity. I am starting to doubt myself; am I a hypocrite?","Praise be to Allah. I congratulate you, my brother, on having been guided to repent to Allah and come back to the right path. This is a blessing that has been bestowed upon you for which you should be thankful, because it is the aim of every believer, and this is the most important thing in this world and the Hereafter. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah does not grant His love to the penitents but they become the elite of people before Him. Were it not that repentance is a word that encompasses all the laws of Islam and truths of faith, the Lord would not rejoice so greatly over the repentance of His slave. End quote. Madarij al-Salikeen (1/343) The fact that the harder you strove in worship, the more means of finding halal (lawful) provision became available to you shows that fearing and obeying Allah brings provision, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.” [al-Talaq 65:2-3] Similarly, sin brings poverty. A person may be deprived of provision because of sins that he commits. Nothing brings provision like doing acts of obedience and avoiding sins. But you have to pay attention to your intention before you start to act, so that the motive for doing good in the first place will be to seek the pleasure of Allah, and you should keep an eye on your intention and guard against it being corrupted during and after the action, so that you can rid it of self-admiration, showing off, and seeking praise and status in people’s hearts because of it, and avoid doing it because of what it brings you of good things in such a way that if your provision was reduced you would stop doing it. These are all things that are contrary to sincerity and spoil acts of obedience. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The things that spoil and cancel out good deeds are too many to list. What matters is not the deed; what matters is protecting the deed from that which would spoil it and cancel it out. End quote. Al-Wabil al-Sayyib (p.20) It should be noted that if a person’s intention in doing acts of worship is to seek the pleasure of Allah and His reward in the Hereafter, and he also intends to seek the immediate reward of obedience in this world, such as ample provision, a good life and so on, there is nothing wrong with that. Allah has encouraged us to obey Him and to avoid disobeying Him, by mentioning the reward in this world, which indicates that there is no blame on the believer if he seeks it. Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person intends two good things by his action: the good of this world and the good of the Hereafter, there is nothing wrong with that [i.e., no blame and no sin on him] because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.” [al-Talaq 65:2-3] al-Qawl al-Mufeed (2/244) Do not let the Shaytan tell you that you are a hypocrite or insincere, because his aim is to divert you from doing righteous deeds and to lead you astray from the path of good. Do not let your motive in doing acts of obedience be the provision that they bring, in such a way that if the benefits were to dry up you would stop doing them. Rather make your deeds sincerely for your Lord, and thank Him for the good things that He has bestowed on you: “And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: ‘If you give thanks (by accepting Faith and worshipping none but Allah), I will give you more (of My Blessings); but if you are thankless (i.e. disbelievers), verily, My punishment is indeed severe.’” [Ibraheem 14:7] And Allah knows best."
243,Does she have to obey her husband if he tells her to work outside the home?,"Question To begin, I state that I embraced Islam about 15 years ago, part of what is so impressive to me is the true revolution to women and their rghts which Islam has made, alhumdo lillah. But regretfully, so many Muslims do not acknowledge nor apply these standards and I have seen many women taken advantage of due to it. So my question is rgarding ""Womens Rights""... men are obligated to certain maintanance of women, but women are not prohibited from certain things with her husbands permission. So how can a woman protect herself from being taken advantage of by her husband? For instance, he wants her to work within his business, still take care of the children an even have more children, bringing the infant to work following the delivery as early as the first week out of the hospital. She is repsonsible for the grocery shopping, taking the older child to day care, working at his business, preparing meals, and keeping the house neat. He will assist periodically but not without stating that he has done so as if she should have done it herself. Can she insist on staying home and being supported? Or must she obey her husband - since he is not asking her to do something haram? But she is tired of being tired and unable to convince him her place is in the home, or even be considerate of her needs and he is always unsatisfied by how she isn't performing to his level of satisfaction. Sorry this is so lengthy, but it is a common problem among many sisters I have seen, taking the rights Allah gave us and not being taken advantage of.","Praise be to Allah. Allaah has made men the protectors and maintainers of women for two reasons, what Allaah has given to men and what men earn. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [al-Nisa’ 4:34] The fact that Allaah has given men more than women in terms of reasoning, thinking and physical strength is something concerning which there is no dispute. This is what Allaah has given to men. With regard to what men earn, this refers to the husband’s spending on his wife, which is something that is obligatory and is the basis for the man being the protector and maintainer of the wife. It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah with regard to women for Allaah has entrusted them to you and intimacy with them has become permissible for you by the word of Allaah. Their rights over you are that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.” Narrated by Muslim, 1218. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that it is obligatory for the husband to spend on his wife and clothe her. This is established by scholarly consensus. Sharh Muslim, 8/184. One of the reasons why it is obligatory for the husband to spend on the wife is that the wife is prevented from earning an income because of her duties towards her husband, children and house. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The obligation of spending on one's wife and children.” Then he narrated the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of charity is that which leaves one independent of means, and the upper hand is better than the lower hand, and start with those who are dependent upon you.” Al-Bukhaari, 1426; Muslim, 1034. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: The reason why it is obligatory to spend on the wife is that she is prevented from earning because of her duties to fulfil the husband’s rights. There is scholarly consensus that this is obligatory. Al-Fath, 9/625. The husband has to fear Allaah his Lord, and take care of the wife and children that Allaah has entrusted to him. It is not permissible for him to force his wife to do that which she is unable to do. She does not have to work and spend on the house and on him; rather it is obligatory for him to spend on her even if she is rich. The role that the woman plays in the home is very important, because she looks after the house and takes care of it, and she fulfils her husband’s rights by preparing the house for him, keeping it clean and tidy, making food, looking after the children, and many other things. The woman does not have to work outside the house, especially if going out will expose her to mixing with non-mahram men and failing or falling short in her duties towards her house and children. As mentioned above, it is obligatory for the husband to spend on her, according to scholarly consensus. He has to realize this and make his wife feel safe and protected in her house so that she can do that which Allaah has enjoined upon her. See also the answer to question no. 5591. And Allaah knows best."
244,Rulings on upholding the ties of kinship for females,"Question my sister who has shahada is married to a man who is not, at the time she didn;t know that he is haram for her. My husband will not allow me to visit her home because he is not muslim, it this allowed? I would just visit her home when he is not there","Praise be to Allah.There follow some details about the issue of women upholding their ties of kinship, and what they should do with husbands who prevent them from doing so. Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even for females, who must uphold them as much as they can. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to prevent his wife or daughter from upholding her ties of kinship, and if he stops her from visiting them, but he lets her convey greetings to them, whether by letter or through a third person, or send them gifts, then she should do that. It is sufficient even if she only sends greetings without a gift, but if she sends her greetings with a gift, that is better. If he stops her from sending a gift but allows her to send greetings, then she should send greetings. If he allows her to send a gift but stops her from sending greetings, then she should send a gift. If he allows her to go and see them, then she should go. If he stops her from doing anything that comes under the heading of upholding ties of kinship, then there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator. In this case she should maintain her family ties in the way that is least objectionable to her husband or father, whether it is sending gifts or conveying greetings, and she can conceal that if she is fearful. If her relatives are faced with some hardship, she should help them with what they need, even if he says not to. She should uphold her family ties by offering condolences in the case of bereavement or loss, and condolence means advising patience. She should also congratulate them on joyful occasions, and congratulating them means praying that they will enjoy to the full whatever has brought them joy, and that it will not be spoilt for them. Such joyful events include the return of a traveller, a wedding, etc. She should not adorn herself or display her adornment in front of those to whom she should not show herself, such as cousins (sons of maternal uncles or paternal uncles), and she should convey her greetings to them from behind a barrier and without making her voice soft, but this is only in cases where there is no fear of fitnah, otherwise she may convey greetings through a third party. She does not have to attend funerals. It is not permissible for the husband to stop his wife from upholding the ties of kinship even if it involves her going out, but she should not go out except with his permission. The same applies to fathers. The wife should treat her husband gently so that she will still be able to fulfil her shar’i duty of upholding the ties of kinship. We ask Allaah to put all our affairs in order."
245,"Ruling on using someone else’s belongings without asking him for permission, when you know that he would agree to that","Question What is the ruling on not asking for permission when using people’s belongings, when we know that they would agree to that?","Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that it is forbidden to make use of someone else’s property except with his willing consent, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible [to take or use] the property of any individual except with his willing consent.” Narrated by Ahmad (20172); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (7662). Abu Dawood (5003) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn as-Saa’ib ibn Yazeed, from his father, from his grandfather, that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “No one of you should take his brother’s property in play or in earnest. And whoever has taken his brother’s staff, let him return it.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. Ahmad (27803) narrated from Abu Humayd as-Saa‘idi that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a man to take his brother’s staff without his willing consent.” That is because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) emphatically forbade the property of one Muslim to another Muslim. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Silsilah as-Saheehah (5/280). As-San‘aani said in Subul as-Salaam (3/61): The hadiths indicate that it is prohibited to take a Muslim’s property, even a small amount, except with his willing consent, and there is scholarly consensus on that. End quote. If it is known that the person agrees to let others use his things, then there is nothing wrong with it in that case, because of the hadiths quoted above and because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {There is not upon the blind [any] constraint nor upon the lame constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselves when you eat from your [own] houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your father's brothers or the houses of your father's sisters or the houses of your mother's brothers or the houses of your mother's sisters or [from houses] whose keys you possess or [from the house] of your friend. There is no blame upon you whether you eat together or separately. But when you enter houses, give greetings of peace upon each other - a greeting from Allah, blessed and good. Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses [of ordinance] that you may understand} [an-Noor 24:61]. Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (12/315): With regard to the words {or [from the house] of your friend} … the friend is the one who is sincere to you in his friendship, and you are sincere to him in his friendship. However, it was said that this verse was abrogated by the verses {do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted} [al-Ahzaab 33:53] and {And if you do not find anyone therein, do not enter them} [an-Noor 24:28], and by the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “It is not permissible [to take or use] the property of any Muslim except with his willing consent.” It was said: This is clear, and the ruling based on it is more correct. Muhammad ibn Thawr quoted Ma‘mar as saying: I entered the house of Qataadah and saw some fresh dates there, so I started to eat them. He said: What is this? I said: I saw some fresh dates in your house, so I ate. He said: You did well. Allah, may He be exalted, says: {or [from the house] of your friend}. ‘Abd ar-Razzaak narrated from Ma‘mar that Qataadah said concerning the verse {or [from the house] of your friend}: If you enter the house of your friend without asking him for permission, there is nothing wrong with that. Ma‘mar said: I said to Qataadah: May I drink from this vessel? He said: You are my friend! What is this asking permission? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to enter a garden of Abu Talhah that was called Bayraha’ and drink from a fresh water source there without his permission, as our scholars stated. And they said that water belongs to its owners, and if it is permissible to drink from the water of a friend without his permission, then it is permissible to eat his fruit and food if it is known that the owner would agree to that, because that is of no great significance and is readily available, or because of the friendship between them. Similarly, Umm Haraam fed the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he slept in her house, because usually whatever food is in the house belongs to the man and his wife is not the owner of that food. All of this applies so long as you do not take food away with you, and do not intend thereby to save your own money, and so long as what is taken is only a small amount. End quote. As-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (p. 575): This passage points to the general holistic principle that “custom and tradition make exceptions to what is stated in general, just as one statement may make exempt what is stated in general.” Because in principle it is not allowed to eat the food of another person, Allah made an exception allowing one to eat from the houses of the people mentioned here, because custom and tradition allow that. With regard to issues that depend on permission from the owner of the thing, if it is known that he gave permission, either verbally or according to custom, it is permissible to go ahead and make use of it. Based on that, if you know that these people agree to you using their things, there is nothing wrong with using them without asking them for permission, because permission has been given according to custom. And Allah knows best."
246,About showing preference to one child in gift-giving,"Question In some cases, one child excels over the others in his honouring and love towards his parents, so his father may single him out for love and gift-giving because of that. Is it fair to reward the one who honours his parents most in return for his doing so?","Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly some children are better than others; this is well known. But the father has no right to show favouritism because of that. On the contrary, he has to treat them all fairly because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah and treat your children equally.” So it is not permissible for him to prefer one child over another because he is better or honours his parents more. He has to treat them all equally and be sincere towards all of them, so that they will all be steadfast in honouring their parents and in obeying Allaah and His Messenger. He should not favour some over others in gift-giving, or bequeath wealth to some of them and not others. All of them should be equal in inheritance and in gift-giving, according to what is prescribed in sharee’ah concerning inheritance and gift-giving. They should all be treated fairly as stated in sharee’ah, so the man has the equivalent of the share of two females. So if he gives one of his sons a thousand, a daughter should be given five hundred. If they are wise and tolerant, and they say, Give our brother such-and-such, and they clearly do not mind, and they say, We don’t mind if you give him a car or whatever… and this is clearly done freely and not because they are too shy or are afraid of him, then that is OK. The point is that they must be treated fairly. But if they are wise, whether they are male or female, if they have no objection to one of them being given something for special reasons, then that is OK and they have the right to do that."
247,How to rinse the mouth in wudoo’,"Question Is wudoo invalidated if a person rinses his mouth without putting his finger in his mouth, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to rinse his mouth with his finger? Is this report about him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saheeh?",Praise be to Allah.Wudoo is valid even if one does not insert ones finger in one's mouth when rinsing it. The report mentioned was narrated by Imaam Ahmad with a daeef (weak) isnaad.
248,He used to deprive one of his employees of a rise in salary or promotion. How can he repent?,"Question My question has to do with restoring rights to people whom I harmed, which is the fourth condition of repentance. If the wrongdoer is not able to restore the rights of those whom he wronged, such as if he was a manager with employees under him, and he mistreated one of them by reducing the increase in salary or by not allowing him to get the promotion that he deserved, and after that this manager retired, can he repent, and if he repents, how can he restore the rights of this employee?","Praise be to Allah.In order for repentance from sins having to do with people’s rights to be accepted, it is stipulated that the rights be restored to those who were entitled to them, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has wronged his brother, let him ask him for forgiveness, because there [in the hereafter] there will be no dinar or dirham. [So let him do that] before some of his hasanaat (good deeds) are taken from him and given to his brother, and if he has no hasanaat to his credit, some of his brother’s sayyi’aat (bad deeds) will be taken and added to his burden.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6534). If he took some of his wealth from him by force or by means of a trick, he should ask him to forgive him, or return that wealth to him by any possible means, and it is not stipulated that he should inform him of that. If he has died, he should give it to his heirs. If he is unable to find the one whom he wronged, he should give the wealth in charity on his behalf. If he is unable to return the wealth, and he is not able to ask the one whom he wronged to forgive him, let him repent to his Lord, and perhaps Allah will enable him to settle the matter on the Day of Resurrection. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Rawdat at-Taalibeen (11/246): If some financial right is connected to this sin – such as withholding zakaah, seizing wealth by force and other transgressions against people’s wealth – then in addition to repenting, he must also absolve himself of responsibility by giving zakaah and returning people’s wealth, if it still exists, or replacing it, if it no longer exists, or he should seek forgiveness from the one to whom it is owed, so that he may forgive him. He has to inform the one to whom he owes that wealth, if he is not aware of it, and make sure that it reaches him, if he is elsewhere and he took the wealth from him by force in that place. If he has died, he must give it to his heirs; if there is no heir and he has disappeared, he should give it to a qaadi of good conduct who is religiously committed, and if that is not possible, he should give it in charity to the poor, with the intention of repaying the original owner if he ever finds him. If he cannot afford to do that, he should intend to pay it when he can afford it. If he dies before he is able to pay it, there is the hope that he will be forgiven by the grace of Allah, may He be exalted. An-Nawawi said: I say: according to the apparent meaning of the sound reports, the individual is responsible for wrongdoing, even if he died unable to pay it back, if he borrowed the money for sinful purposes. But if he borrowed money in a situation in which it is permissible to borrow, and was not able to pay it back before he died, or he caused damage to something accidentally and was not able to pay liability before he died, then what appears to be the case is that he is not responsible for that in the hereafter, because there was no sin on his part, and there is the hope that Allah, may He be exalted, will compensate the one who was wronged. With regard to backbiting, if it did not reach the person who was the target of the backbiting, then I have seen in the fatwas of al-Hanaati that it is sufficient to feel remorse and seek forgiveness. If news of it did reach the person who was the target of the backbiting, then what he should do is go to that person and ask him to forgive him. If that is not possible, because he has died or because he is too far away, then he should ask Allah, may He be exalted, for forgiveness, and there is no need to ask that person’s heirs for forgiveness. This is what al-Hanaati said. End quote. Financial rights must be restored to the one who was wronged, but in the case of intangible rights, it is sufficient to feel remorse and seek forgiveness, if news of that did not reach the one who was wronged. With regard to what you mentioned about reducing the rise in salary of that employee, or not giving him the promotion that he deserved, this is a transgression against his tangible rights, by depriving him of money that he deserved; it is also a transgression against his intangible rights, by preventing him from getting a promotion that he deserved. Based on that, with regard to his financial rights, you have to ask him to forgive you, or give him the money which is equivalent to what he was deprived of because of your wrongdoing. You can seek the help of someone who will intercede with the one who was wronged and ask him to forgive you. If you are not able to do either of these two things, then you should feel a great deal of remorse and ask Allah to forgive you, and ask Him, may He be exalted, to settle the matter on your behalf on the Day of Resurrection. With regard to his intangible rights, if he was unaware of your wronging him, then it is sufficient to feel remorse and ask Allah for forgiveness. If he was aware of it, then you must ask him to forgive you, so long as you do not fear greater mischief if he finds out about it. We ask Allah to accept your repentance, help you to fulfil your duties and help you to obey Him. And Allah knows best."
249,Giving women gifts as a compensation for taking their inheritance,Question What is your opinion on those who give women gifts as a compensation for taking their inheritance?.,"Praise be to Allah. During the Jaahiliyyah, the wealth of the deceased would be given to his oldest son; if he had no son then it would go to his brother or paternal uncle. Children and women did not inherit, on the grounds that they could not protect that which should be protected (one’s family and one's honour), nor did they fight or earn booty in war. All of these are jaahili ideas which have been revived in the hearts of some of those whose nature has become distorted in these times. Islam came to declare the Jaahili system of inheritance to be false in general terms, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “There is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents and those nearest related, whether, the property be small or large — a legal share” [al-Nisa’ 4:7] Then the verses were revealed which explain how the estate is to be shared out among women and men, with justice and wisdom from the Wisest of rulers. See al-Tahqeeqaat al-Mardiyyah fi’l-Mabaahith al-Fardiyyah, p. 17 From this it may be understood that depriving women of their inheritance with no legitimate shar’i reason is a serious crime and a transgression against the laws of Allaah and His sacred limits. Allaah says, following the verses on inheritance (interpretation of the meaning): “These are the limits (set by) Allaah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success. 14. And whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment” [al-Nisa’ 4:13-14] and it was proven in the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever appropriates the right of a Muslim by means of a (false) oath, Allaah would decree Hell-fire forhim and would forbid Paradise to him.” Aman said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, even if it issomething insignificant?” He said: “Even if it is the twig of the arak tree.” With regard to giving women gifts to make up for not being given their inheritance etc, this does not do any good at all and does not absolve the sin of the one who does that, no matter what he gives, even if he were to give them gifts that are worth more than their inheritance, because he is giving them that as a gift and he is not giving them the share of inheritance that is theirs according to sharee’ah. If he gives it to them on the basis that it is compensation for them, instead of their rights of inheritance, that will not do any good at all either, because a gift is one thing and sales and compensation are something else. Their rightful inheritance must be given to them, and they must be enabled to dispose of it by keeping it as it is, selling it, giving it away or whatever else an owner is entitled to do with his property. With regard to keeping the inheritance under the control of men, forcing women to sell it to them or to give it up in return for some compensation, or with no compensation, this is not permitted, rather this is usurping and oppression. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent” [al-Nisa’ 4:29] And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Transactions can only take place by mutual consent.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2185; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible (to take) a person’s property except with his consent.” Narrated by Ahmad, 20172; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 7662. The same applies if what makes a woman sell is her shyness in front of men and her eagerness to please them, because of the general meaning of the evidence quoted above. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: A sale is not valid if it is based on compulsion, except when there is a justifiable reason for that. If an unjust ruler forces a person to sell this product to someone and he sells it, that transaction is not valid, because it was not based on mutual consent. Similarly, if you know that this vendor is selling to you out of shyness or embarrassment, it is not permissible for you to buy from him so long as you know that if it were not for his shyness or embarrassment he would not be selling it to you. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 8/121 The sin is compounded further if the women who is being deprived of her inheritance is an orphan, i.e., she has not yet reached the age of puberty and her father has died, and she has been deprived of her inheritance, because that is a transgression of the limits set by Allaah, and also comes under the heading of consuming orphans’ wealth. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!” [al-Nisa’ 4:10] And Allaah knows best."
250,Her relative works in a haraam job and gave her some money as a gift,Question Allaah blessed me with a baby girl and one of my relatives gave me a large amount of money as a gift. This relative works as a sound engineer in television (controlling the sound in films and the like). 1.Is it permissible to spend this money on what I need or do I have to get rid of it by giving it to charitable causes (such as feeding the hungry or other charitable deeds)? 2.My husband is in debt and is hard up. Is it permissible to pay off part of his debt with this money? 3.Is it permissible to accept the gift in the first place if it comes from haraam wealth? 4.Is it permissible to accept a gift from a kaafir?.,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: Haraam wealth is of two types: that which is haraam in and of itself, such as wealth that has been stolen or seized by force. It is not permissible to accept this from anyone, because it must be returned to its owner. (The second type is) that which is haraam because of the way in which it has been acquired, such as money that is taken by means of dealing in riba or doing haraam actions, such as bribes, cheating and payments for singing and dancing. That also includes what you have mentioned of working as a sound engineer for haraam movies and soap operas. This wealth which is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired is haraam only for the one who acquires it. As for the one who takes it from him by permissible means, there is nothing wrong with that, although it is better to refrain from taking it and to err on the side of caution and not benefit from it, especially if not taking it will affect its original owner and make him give up this work. It was narrated in a saheeh report from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he was asked about a person who had a neighbour who consumed riba and invited him to eat with him. He said: Accept his invitation, for the pleasure will be yours and the burden of sin will be his. End quote. Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam (71). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: A man knows that the source of his father's wealth is haraam; can he eat his father’s food? If he does not eat his father's food, is that considered disobedience to his father? He replied: With regard to the man who knows that his father's wealth is haraam, if it is haraam in and of itself, in the sense that he knows that his father stole this money from someone, then it is not permissible to eat it. If you know that your father stole this sheep and slaughtered it, then do not eat and do not accept his invitation. But if it is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired, such as if he deals with riba or cheats and so on, then eat, and the sin is on him. The evidence for that is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him and his family) accepted gifts and food from the Jews, who are known deal in riba and consume haraam. A Jewish woman gave him a poisoned sheep in Khaybar so that he would die, but Allaah protected him against that until an appointed time. And a Jewish man invited him to eat barley bread and fat, and he accepted his invitation and ate. And he bought food for his family from a Jew, and he and his family ate. So let him eat and the sin is on his father. End quote from Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh (13/188). Based on that, there is nothing wrong with your accepting this money that has come to you from your relative and benefiting from it. If you want to give it in charity to your husband who is hard up, he is entitled to charity if he is in debt and hard up, and it is permissible for him to accept your charity, whether the charity is from this money or otherwise. Zaynab, the wife of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah upon him): “O Prophet of Allaah, today you enjoined charity, and I have jewellery that I want to give in charity, but Ibn Mas’ood claimed that he and his children are more deserving that I should give it in charity to them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ibn Mas’ood is right: your husband and your son are more deserving that you should give it in charity to them.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1462) and Muslim (1000). Secondly: The owner of the haraam wealth has to repent to Allaah and get rid of the haraam wealth that he has left, by spending it on charitable causes, or giving it to the poor and needy, debtors and the like, with the intention of getting rid of it not of giving charity, because Allaah is Good and does not accept anything but that which is good. Based on that, if your relative gets rid of this money by giving it to your husband to pay off his debts with it, then he will have done good and your husband can accept it. If he gives it without the intention of getting rid of it and he gives you the money and you give it to your husband, there is nothing wrong with that, as stated above, because you have taken it in a permissible manner which is as a gift, and the sin is only on the one who acquired it (unlawfully). Thirdly: It is permissible to accept the gift of a kaafir, so as to soften his heart towards Islam or to honour him as a relative, neighbour and the like. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) accepted the gift of al-Muqawqas, and the sheep given by the Jewish woman. For more information on that, please see the answer to question number 85108. And Allaah knows best."
251,Using human placentas to treat cancer,"Question A Muslim couple expecting their first child soon would like to preserve the afterbirth (placenta and fetal membranes), which has been found to cure certain forms of cancer. Is this lawful in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen: Question: What is the ruling on keeping the placenta to treat cancer and remove facial wrinkles? He replied as follows: It seems that there is nothing wrong with it so long as there is proof that it is an effective treatment. Question: does the rule that whatever is taken from a living being is dead apply in this case? Answer: dead matter of human origin is taahir (pure). Question: and if it is of no use, should it be buried, or can it be disposed of in any place? Answer: it seems that it is the same as nails and hair. And Allaah knows best."
252,Does medical advice come under the heading of good deeds of which the reward will not cease?,"Question Kindly inform if Sadaqah Jariah includes beneficial knowledge that helps people to get cure from diseases ? My mother passed away recently. She used to give advice on eating or drinking items which gives cure. For example she said to boil bitter gourd (korola) in water and drinking the soup brings great benefits to cure from diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney ailments, etc. If I pass on her good advices to people, will she get rewards for that ?","Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a righteous son who will pray for him.” According to the scholars, “ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah)” is understood to refer to wealth which is donated as an endowment, the income of which is ongoing and is spent on good causes. This is what is known in fiqh as a waqf. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is proof of the reward for waqfs and endowments, and it is a refutation of those among the people of Kufah who disallowed that, because ongoing charity after death can only be achieved by means of awqaaf (pl. or waqf).""(Ikmaal al-Mu‘allim 5/373). Ibn al- Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah)” that is, charity of which the benefit continues and the reward is ongoing, such as a waqf, building a mosque or jaami‘, digging a well, building a road, redigging springs, and other kinds of good works.""(Sharh al-Masaabeeh 1/193). This is also what may be understood from the hadith that was narrated by Ibn Maajah (242) from Abu Hurayrah, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The good deeds and rewards that will reach a believer after his death are: knowledge which he taught and spread; a righteous son whom he leaves behind; a copy of the Qur’an that he leaves as a legacy; a mosque that he built; a house that he built for wayfarers; a canal that he dug; or charity that he gave during his lifetime when he was in good health. These deeds will reach him after his death.” Medical advice that the deceased leaves behind cannot be described as ongoing charity, but there is the hope that the second thing that is mentioned in the hadith will apply to that, namely “beneficial knowledge.” Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge…” is what is meant Islamic knowledge, or worldly knowledge? He replied: The hadith is general in meaning, and any knowledge that benefits people is something for which a person will attain reward, but first and foremost among that is Islamic knowledge. So if we assume that a person dies having taught another person some permissible craft or trade, from which the one who learned it benefits, then he will attain reward for that."" (Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh 117/17). And Allah knows best."
253,What should he do if he does not understand anything of the Friday khutbah?,"Question I'm presently living in Africa right now. So I can't speak the language down here. During the friday khutbah, I never gain anything from it. what should I do when the khutbah is going on? Can i READ the koran and remember my Lord or should I just sit there and listen to something that I don't even understand?","Praise be to Allah.If you listen, even if you do not understand anything, you will be doing something good, in sha Allah. Some of the scholars excused those who do not understand the language of the khutbah and allowed them to occupy themselves with dhikr or reading Qur’aan, subject to the condition that they do not disturb others who are listening to the khutbah. The view which I favour, however, is that you should listen even if you do not understand."
254,Ruling on administering anaesthesia at the time of death,Question What is the ruling on using anaesthesia at the time when the soul is departing the body?,"Praise be to Allah.Death is one of the things that every person goes through, when his soul is taken away and he leaves behind the restrictions of the physical body and its connection with earthly matters, and passes into the vast realm of the Hereafter. That is the moment when the soul departs from the body, after which it has no control over it. In at-Tabaqaat al-Kubra by Ibn Sa‘d (4/260) and al-Mustadrak by al-Haakim (5915) it is narrated that ‘Awaanah ibn al-Hakam said: ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas used to say: “How amazing it is that the one whom death approaches when he is still in his right mind cannot describe it”. Then when his own death approached, his son ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr said to him: “O my father, you used to say, ‘How amazing it is that the one whom death approaches when he is still in his right mind cannot describe it’; describe death to us whilst you are still in your right mind.” He said: “O my son, death is too great to be described, but I shall describe something of it to you: I feel as though the mountains of Radwa are on my neck, and I feel as though there are sharp thorns inside me, and I feel as though my soul is emerging through the eye of a needle. End quote. As this transition is so difficult, all remedies and painkillers are a waste of time. Death is a process of the unseen in which the soul is separated from the body, and anesthetics and painkillers only serve to reduce physical pain that has to do with the tangible and physical world. The realm of death and the hereafter lies beyond such means and is not subject to regular treatment and remedies. Based on that, what appears to us to be the case here is that it is not allowed to use anaesthesia at the time of death, for the following reasons: 1. The basic principle concerning anaesthesia is that it is not allowed except in cases of necessity, and there is no need for it in this case. We have stated above that anaesthesia does not remove the pain of death; rather it has no nothing to do with the process of death that belongs to the world of the unseen. As that is the case, using anaesthesia falls under the heading of doing something that is not allowed, without any legitimate shar‘i reason for permitting it; we do not know that doing that will bring any benefit or that there is any need for it, nor do we think it most likely that that will be the case this situation. See also the answer to question no. 46050 2. It is not possible for anyone to know the exact time of death. Anaesthesia may cause physical harm or lead to complications. In fact some doctors say that it is a type of poison. Hence it is unacceptable to introduce something that is definitely harmful to try to ward off something that is mere conjecture; in fact that is dealing with something the true nature of which we do not know and we have no experience of it at all, and we do not know whether anaesthesia is beneficial in this case. Moreover, in the case of the righteous slave whose life Allah is bringing to an end with obedience and worship, whom we see turning to Allah, may He be exalted, and remembering Him, we expect him to utter the Shahaadah (testimony of faith) that will be stored up for him with his Lord, and anaesthesia may deprive him of this virtue. It was narrated that Mu‘aadh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one whose last words are Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah will enter Paradise.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3116. Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is, without any punishment at all, or the punishment he deserves will be reduced in some ways. We interpreted it in this manner because every Muslim will inevitably enter Paradise, even if he is punished, so the report would not mean anything if having as one’s final words the testimony of faith guarantees admittance to Paradise, unless there is a particular advantage in doing so, and this advantage is that either he will enter it with those who are saved, without any punishment, or Allah, may He be glorified, will reduce some of the punishment that he deserves, and admit him to Paradise before the time when he would have deserved that if he had not ended his life with these words.

255,Ruling on placing death notices on the board in the mosque,Question Is it permissible to announce the death of someone who died in the village on a board that is placed in the mosque for that purpose?.,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: Announcing a death in a manner that resembles the kind of death announcements that are forbidden is not permissible. As for announcing it among his relatives and acquaintances so that they can attend the funeral prayer for him and attend his burial, that is permissible, and does not come under the heading of the kind of death announcements that are forbidden, because when the Negus died in Abyssinia, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told the Muslims of his death and offered the funeral prayer for him. Secondly: A board should not be placed in the mosque for the purpose of announcing deaths and the like, because the mosques were not built for that. End quote.

256,Her husband promised that he would divorce her after her period ended,"Question A problem happened between my husband and I. He beats me for every small and big matter. So I went to my neighbour and refused returning to him. He said to me: “return to your home for one month, until you get purified of your menstruation period then I will divorce you”. I returned for this reason, but later he said that he does not intend to divorce me and that he said what he said only to let me know the Islamic ruling on divorce; that it should be after one menstruation period if he does not have an intercourse with me. I refuse what he says because he promised me and gave me a word when I was at the neighbour’s house, that he will divorce me after the period. Is this considered divorce or not?.","Praise be to Allah. If a man says to his wife: “Go back to your house and children for a month, until your period comes then after it ends I will divorce you,” this does not count as a divorce (talaaq), because it is only a promise of divorce. Divorce does not take place unless the husband actually issues a divorce after the period. A person may decide to divorce, then change his mind, and perhaps that is better for you and your children. It is essential that the relationship between the spouses be based on kindness. It is not permissible for the husband to beat his wife except in the case of her being wilfully defiant (nushooz) and not responding to his exhortations and advice or forsaking her in bed. But he does not have the right to beat her on her face or beat her in a way that causes severe pain. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property). As to those women on whose part you see ill‑conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]. We ask Allaah to set your affairs straight. And Allaah knows best."
257,He wants to go back to his country but there is war there; is his wife obliged to obey him?,"Question My dad went back to his country because he said he doesn't want to stay in a kafir country; he wants the family to come as well, but my mum doesn't want to go because she is saying my children have to finish their education and they are about to start university and she doesn't want to ruin it for them. My question is, is it a sin for my mum to not obey her husband and do what he wants her to do? Will she be punished for it? What do you think I should do, because my mum really doesn't want to go and her mum and sister are saying not to go there because their is war and so on.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: Staying in a kafir country is not permissible unless certain conditions are met, the most important of which is that the person be religiously committed and thus protected against whims and desires; he should also have sufficient knowledge and insight that will protect him against specious arguments; he should be able to practice his religion openly; and he and his family should be safe. For more details please see the answer to question no. 13363 and 27211. Secondly: The wife is obliged to obey her husband and move with him wherever he moves, so long as she did not stipulate that her husband should not take her out of her homeland or make her travel to a specific country, or so long as moving with him will not cause her any obvious and considerable harm, such as if he wants to move to a country where there is war or it is thought most likely that she will encounter harm such as imprisonment and the like. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He may travel with her, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to travel with his wives, unless it is a kind of travel in which there is fear (of harm), in which case she does not have to do that. End quote from al-Mughni (7/223) And it says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (5/187): The husband may travel with his wife, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions used to travel with their wives, unless the travel involves fear or there is danger on the road or in the land to which he wants to travel. In that case he does not have the right to take her with him without her permission, because of the hadeeth, “There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.” Or if she stipulated that she should stay in her own land, in which case she is entitled to that condition, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The most deserving of conditions to be fulfilled are those by means of which intimacy became permissible to you.” End quote. She does not have the right to refuse to accompany her husband because of the children’s education, because education may be acquired in various places and through various means such as distance learning and so on. So it is not permissible for her to disobey her husband for the sake of her children. Thirdly: You have to obey your father and travel with him if he wants that, so long as your travelling to his country will not pose a danger to you. It should be obvious to you that the father has rights and a high status, and Allah has commanded us to honour our parents; He has mentioned that alongside obedience to Him and affirmation of His Oneness (Tawheed). Claiming that the father is not thinking of his children's best interests is mistaken thinking in most cases, because of the natural compassion that the father has for his children, but what the father thinks is in the children's best religious or worldly interests may make him overlook this compassion. Allah has commanded the father to protect his children and guard them against that which may lead to doom and loss, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded” [al-Tahreem 66:6] And it was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for her flock. The slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7138) and Muslim (1829). And al-Bukhari (7151) and Muslim (142) narrated that Ma‘qil ibn Yasar al-Muzani (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no person whom Allah puts in charge of others, and when he dies he is insincere to his subjects, but Allah will forbid Paradise to him.” So it is no surprise that a father would flee with his children from the land of kufr, fearing corruption and deviance for them, and that he would prefer soundness of religious commitment to worldly interests. If his move to his homeland is safe, then all the members of his family are obliged to obey him and accompany him. And Allah knows best."
258,He is not sure whether he said the opening takbeer or not,"Question I entered the mosque and the imam was sitting for the first tashahhud. I joined him in the prayer, but I forgot whether I said the opening takbeer or not.","Praise be to Allah.The opening takbeer is one of the pillars or essential parts of the prayer, which is not waived because of forgetting or not knowing about it, and it cannot be substituted with anything else. If a person remembers during his prayer that he forgot to say the opening takbeer, or he is not sure whether he said it, he has to start the prayer over again. If his doubt about that comes after the prayer, then it does not matter, because doubts after completing an act of worship do not affect it. Based on this, if the doubt of this worshipper who is not sure whether he said the opening takbeer or not came during the prayer, he has to stop praying and start the prayer over again. If the doubt came after the prayer, then he does not have to do anything and his prayer is valid. The evidence that the opening takbeer is an essential part of the prayer is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (757) and Muslim (397) from the hadeeth of the one who prayed badly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: ""Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.” Then he said: “When you stand up to pray, say takbeer then recite whatever you know of the Qur'aan. Then bow until you are at ease in bowing, then stand up until you are standing up straight. Then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then sit up until you are sitting up straight, and do that throughout your prayer."" And Abu Dawood (61), al-Tirmidhi (3) and Ibn Maajah (275) narrated that 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The key to prayer is purification, its opening is to say Allaahu akbar and its closing is to say al-salaamu’ alaykum.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The opening takbeer is one of the pillars (essential parts) of prayer without which the prayer is not valid. This is our view and the view of Maalik, Ahmad and the majority of earlier and later scholars. Ibn al-Mundhir and our companions narrated that al-Zuhri said: The prayer begins simply with the intention, without any takbeer. But Ibn al-Mundhir said: No one said that except al-Zuhri. Then he said: We have stated that the prayer is not valid without the opening takbeer. If the imam or the person praying behind him omits it by mistake or deliberately, his prayer has not begun, and the takbeer for bowing does not make up for it, neither does any other takbeer. This is our view and is the view of Abu Haneefah, Maalik, Ahmad, Dawood and the majority. End quote from al-Majmoo', 3/250 Whoever is not sure whether he has said the opening takbeer or not should assume that he has not said it. Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: If a person forgets to say the opening takbeer or is not sure about that, then he has to say takbeer straight away, and follow the imam in whatever comes after he said this takbeer. If he said the takbeer after the imam has done the first rak'ah, then he should regard himself as having missed the first rak'ah, which he should make up after the imam says the salaam. If he said the takbeer in the third rak'ah, then he should regard himself as having missed two rak'ahs, which he should make up after the imam says the salaam. This applies if he is not affected by waswasah (whispers from the Shaytaan). If he is affected by waswasah, then he should regard himself as having said the opening takbeer at the beginning of the prayer, and not make up anything, in order to annoy the Shaytaan and combat his whispers. Praise be to Allaah. End quote. Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 11/275 If the doubt comes after finishing the prayer, then he should not pay any attention to it. Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person is uncertain after finishing a prayer or any other act of worship as to whether he omitted a essential part of it, he should not pay any attention to that doubt.

259,Ruling on giving the expiation for delay in making up missed fasts to relatives,"Question I have a maternal aunt who is a widow and has no income; she lives on her own and receives some financial help from two of her brothers. I also have a maternal uncle who works but his salary is not sufficient for his needs; he has four sons, two of whom are studying in university. My question is: is it permissible to give them the expiation for delay in making up missed fasts (eighteen days)? How much is that expiation, and how is it to be given to them?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: If a person delays making up missed Ramadan fasts, one of the following must be the case: 1.His delay was for a valid reason, in which case he only has to make up the missed fast; 2.There was no reason for the delay. In this case he must make up the fast and, in addition to making it up, he must also offer expiation. This is the view of the majority of scholars (may Allah have mercy on them). Some of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) were of the view, which is the second view concerning this issue – that what is required is to make up the missed fast and also to repent for the delay in making it up without an excuse. As for the expiation, it is not obligatory. This has been discussed previously in fatwas no. 122319 and 26865. Secondly: Expiation for delay in making up missed fasts – according to those scholars who say that it is required – is not offered in the form of cash; rather it is to be offered in the form of food which a person gives. What is required is to feed one poor person for each day. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You have to repent to Allah, may He be glorified, for this great delay. What you should have done was fast the days that you missed before the next Ramadan came following the year in which you did not fast. In addition to repenting, you must also feed one poor person for each day, giving half a saa‘ of the local staple food, whether it is dates, rice or something else. This is equivalent to approximately one and a half kilograms. It should all be given to some poor people, or even to one poor person. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz (15/341) There is nothing wrong with you giving this expiation to your maternal uncle or your maternal aunt, so long as they are in need. In fact that is better than giving it to someone who is not one of your relatives. The amount in your case, for all the days in question, is 27 kg of rice. And Allah knows best."
260,Can We Read Quran While Lying Down?,Question What is the ruling on reading Quran from the Mus-haf whilst lying down in bed for a person who is not suffering from any health or physical problem?,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran from the Mus-haf whilst lying down. Al-Bukhari (7549) and Muslim (301) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lie in ‘Aishah’s lap and recite Quran. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahهh Muslim: “This indicates that it is permissible to read Quran when reclining and lying down.” Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan said: “There is nothing wrong with reading the Quran when lying down, whether one is lying on a bed or on the ground. There is nothing wrong with that. A person may recite Quran whatever position he is in, standing or sitting or reclining, and whether he has wudu or is in a state of minor impurity, if he is reciting from memory. But if he is reading from the Mus-haf, then it is not permissible for the one who does not have wudu to touch the Mus-haf unless he has done wudu.” (Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Fawzan) For more information about the issues related to lying down and sitting, please see these answers: 294088 , and 13822 . And Allah knows best."
261,Ruling on removing body hair,"Question What is the ruling on a woman removing hair from her body? If it is permitted, then who is allowed to do that for her?",Praise be to Allah. It is permissible for her to do that apart from the hair of the eyebrows and head; she is not permitted to remove that hair or any part of it. She may do that herself or her husband or one of her mahrams may do it with regard to the parts of the body that they are allowed to see; or another woman may do it with regard to the parts of the body that she is allowed to see.
262,Ruling on working for UberEATS (delivering food that may be halal or haram),"Question I have read through many Fitwas on this site which can be very close to this scenario. But due to technological advisement it is very hard to draw line between halal or haram so I want you to give Fitwa specifically for this case. I live in New Zealand. Uber has started food delivery service here recently. It is good job as a delivery person because you can work on your own convenience. The restaurants/takeaways on the panel are Halal, non-Halal & vegetarian. It works on the following principles Switch on the app. on your mobile when you are ready/available. A pop-op message will appear on the screen that a meal order is xx min way (xx min is time to reach a restaurant from your current location). When you accept the request then you can see the Restaurant name and address. But once you accept the order, you can’t decline unless your car is broken or in an accident. Once you reach the restaurant and tell your order number, you will be given a sealed bag (you don’t know the contents). After receiving the bag, delivery address appears on the App. My question is that delivering the food for UberEAT is halal or not in the following circumstances You don’t know that from where you will pick the food unless you accept an order and you never get to know what is inside the packet (food/beverages/drinks).","Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible to work in delivering haram food such as that which contains pork or the meat of animals that were not slaughtered in the prescribed manner, or alcohol, because that comes under the heading of helping in sin. The wages earned from doing that are also haraam. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. It says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat (2/250): It is not valid to be hired to deliver “dead meat” (from an animal that was not slaughtered in the prescribed manner) and similar things, such as haram blood, to be eaten, for one who is not compelled to eat that; or to deliver alcohol to be drunk, for the reasons mentioned above, and the one who does that is not entitled to any wages for doing it, because haram service cannot be paid for. But if the improperly-slaughtered meat is being delivered to someone who has no choice but to eat it, then it is valid. End quote. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone helps a man to disobey Allah, then he is sinning, because he is helping in sin and transgression. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed alcohol, the one who presses (the grapes et cetera), the one for whom they are pressed, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who pours it, the one who drinks it, and the one consumes its price. Most of those mentioned, such as the one who presses it, the one who carries it and the one who pours it, are helping the drinker to drink it. Hence it is forbidden to sell weapons to those who will use them to fight in unlawful ways, such as fighting the Muslims or infighting among Muslims (fitnah). End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (22/141). Since when doing the work mentioned it is not clear what type of food is being delivered, then this work is not permissible, because you are living in a non-Muslim country, where the people usually eat pork and drink alcohol. And Allah knows best."
263,It is not permissible to eat foods that are prepared by the kuffaar for their festivals,Question Is it permissible for a Muslim to eat the foods that the people of the Book or the mushrikoon prepare for their festivals or accept such foods if they are given on the occasion of their festivals?.,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for the Muslim to eat foods that the Jews, Christians and mushrikoon make for their festivals. It is not permissible either for a Muslim to accept such things that are given to them on the occasion of their festivals, because that implies honouring them and cooperating with them in manifesting their symbols and propagating their innovations and sharing their happiness on the days of their festivals. That may also lead to taking their festivals as festivals for us too, or to exchanging invitations to meals or to give gifts on one another’s festivals at the very least. This is a kind of deviation and innovation in religion. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it, will have it rejected.” And it is not permissible to give them anything on the occasion of their festivals."
264,"The reality of that which is called “umm as-subyaan” or “al-qareenah”, and the extent to which offering a sacrifice is beneficial in warding off harm from the foetus","Question If a woman has a qareenah – umm as-subyaan – with her, will offering the ‘aqeeqah sacrifice be beneficial in warding off (the harm of) the qareenah? [Translator’s note: “umm as-subyaan” or “qareenah” refers to a jinni which, according to folklore, accompanies and harms boy children]","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: With regard to that which is called “umm as-subyaan” or “qareenah”, by which people mean a companion from among the jinn that gains power over the pregnant woman and causes her to miscarry, this is one of the myths and fables of the common folk which does not really exist. However a miscarriage may be caused by sihr (witchcraft) that Allah decrees should happen. If a spell is cast against the woman and her foetus after it has been formed, or against the foetus only, or it is cast on a woman so that she will not have children, and Allah decrees that that should happen, then it may have an impact on the foetus, whether that is after it has been formed or so that it will not be formed completely and born. This has been discussed in detail in the answer to question no. 149291 With regard to that which is called “umm as-subyaan” or “qareenah”, which is a companion from among the jinn, there is no basis for that. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: About amulets, and about “umm as-subyaan” – perhaps she means amulets against “umm as-subyaan” – and she states that she read a lengthy account about “umm as-subyaan” that was narrated from Sulaymaan (peace be upon him), and she hopes that the shaykh can offer some advice; do these things have any impact on human beings? He replied: These things that people say about “umm as-subyaan” all have no basis and no attention should be paid to them. Rather they are myths of the common folk, who claimed that there is a female jinni that accompanies boy children. There is no basis for any of that. Similarly, what they attribute to Sulaymaan all has no basis, no attention should be paid to it, and it should not be relied upon. Each person has an angel and a devil with him, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us. Every person has a jinn companion, and this is not something that is only for some people and not others. Whoever obeys Allah and follows His commands, Allah will suffice him against the evil of his devil, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, when he was asked: Do you, O Messenger of Allah, also have a devil with you? He said: “Yes, but Allah helped me against him and he became Muslim.” As for “umm as-subyaan,” there is no basis for this and this idea or story has no sound narration. Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (tape 594) Secondly: If a woman wants to protect her infant in the womb or after his birth, then she should recite ruqyah as prescribed in Islam for protection and as a remedy; to protect him before anything bad happens to him and as a remedy if he becomes sick. It is not permissible to use amulets or charms. In the rest of the answer of Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) referred to above, he said: It is not permissible to use these amulets, whether for a boy or a girl or a sick person. Rather permissible ruqyahs should be recited over him. Impermissible ruqyahs include those whose meanings are unknown and those that contain weird words. But performing ruqyah by reciting the Holy Qur’an or good supplications is something that is prescribed in Islam. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to perform ruqyah for his ummah, and Jibreel (peace be upon him) performed ruqyah for him. And he said: “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah so long as it does not involve shirk (associating others with Allah).” Recitation may be done over a boy or girl in the event of sickness; his father or mother or anyone else may recite over him al-Faatihah, Aayat al-Kursiy, “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad” [i.e., Soorat al-Ikhlaas] and al-Mi‘wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur’an), and other soorahs, and they may pray for well-being for him. Or that may be recited over the sick person and one may pray for their well-being. Ruqyah may also be done for one who has been bitten or stung – as the Sahaabah did for one who had been bitten or stung, and Allah healed him. There is nothing wrong with any of that, and it is prescribed in Islam. But if he recites over him a devilish ruqyah of which the meaning is not known, or he recites the names of devils or supplications that are unknown, this is not permissible. The same applies to amulets which are called by various names; it is not permissible to wear them. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade the wearing of amulets and he said: “Whoever wears an amulet, may Allah never fulfill his wish and whoever wears a seashell, may Allah never protect him from what he fears.” This is a warning against wearing amulets and charms and other such things that are worn by the ignorant, and against the threads that are tied on the sick person and so on. All of that is forbidden. It is not permissible to wear them because of that which they call “umm as-subyaan” or anything else; rather one should seek protection in the manner prescribed by Allah, for He has prescribed for us supplications seeking refuge in Him. If a person wakes up and recites Aayat al-Kursiy after the obligatory prayer of Fajr, and he recites “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad” [i.e., Soorat al-Ikhlaas] and al-Mi‘wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur’an) three times, this is one of the ways of seeking refuge with Allah as prescribed in Islam. Another way of seeking refuge with Allah as prescribed in Islam is reciting the du‘aa’ “A’oodhu bi kalimat-illah il-taammati min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created)” three times, morning and evening. Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (tape 594). Thirdly: “Umm as-subyaan” is mentioned in a report which says that reciting the adhaan in the newborn’s right ear and the iqaamah in his left ear will benefit him so that he will not be harmed by “umm as-subyaan”. But this report is mawdoo‘ (fabricated) and is not saheeh (sound). Therefore it is not fit to be quoted as evidence to prove the existence of what is called “umm as-subyaan”, and there is nothing in it to suggest that it is prescribed to recite the adhaan and iqaamah in the newborn’s ears. It was narrated from Talhah ibn ‘Ubaydullah that Husayn said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has a baby and recites the adhaan in his right ear and the iqaamah in his left ear, he will not be harmed by umm as-subyaan.” Narrated by Abu Ya‘la in al-Musnad, 12/150 Shaykh al-Albaani said in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah (321): It is fabricated. Fourthly: Once it is clear that there is no basis for that which is called “umm as-subyaan”, and that it is one of the myths of the common folk, it will be clear that there is no need to ward off this imaginary danger by offering a sacrifice or otherwise. Rather it can be warded off by learning sound ‘aqeedah (beliefs), ignoring waswaas and imaginary things, seeking the help of Allah, may He be exalted, and remembering Him often. The individual will not find any protection like the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted. As it says in the hadeeth about Yahya ibn Zakariyya (peace be upon them both), concerning the commands which Allah instructed him to convey to the Children of Israel, he said: “I instruct you to remember Allah, for the likeness of that is the likeness of a man who sets out with the enemy in hot pursuit until, when he comes to a strong fortress, he protects himself from them by entering it. Likewise a person cannot protect himself from the Shaytaan except by remembering Allah.” Narrated and classed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi (2863). Furthermore, offering the ‘aqeeqah sacrifice on behalf of the newborn on the seventh day is part of the Sunnah, and we hope that this will be beneficial for the newborn, so that his Lord, may He be exalted, will protect him from the evils of humans and jinn, and will decree much good for him as a result of that ‘aqeeqah. But that has nothing to do with the myth of “umm as-subyaan”, as mentioned above. Please see also the answer to question no. 12448 And Allah knows best."
265,"She feels sad and depressed, and is asking for a solution","Question I am a twenty-four year old woman. I feel sad almost all the time, and have no desire to make contact with people. I feel very lonely and as if nothing could make me happy, even though I offer all the obligatory prayers, even Fajr on time, I pray qiyam al-layl, I read a juz of Quran every day in order to complete it once every month, I try to draw closer to Allah and I have performed ‘Umrah more than once. But these feelings are not going away. Praise be to Allah, I am blessed, my life is pretty good and is better than many, praise be to Allah. I acknowledge that and I give thanks to Allah for it; I hope that He will not call me to account for my negative feelings. But I do not know what is the cause of these bad feelings. This has been going on for more than a year, and started before the unfortunate developments that have occurred in the Arab world. It has gotten worse with the killings in our country and the loss of relatives of some friends of mine. How can I overcome this negativity?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: First of all, we would like to welcome you to the Islam Q&A website. We ask Allah to benefit us and you by means of what we say, and to relieve us and our Muslim ummah of distress. Noble sister… Trouble is inevitable in the life of this world; this is how Allah has decreed it and He has made it a place of trials and tests, and a bridge to the Hereafter. Even the best of His creation, the prophets, were never free of troubles. Life is never plain sailing for anyone, young or old. You may have reason to rejoice one day, then reason to feel sad for many other days; this is how it always is in the life of this world and this is how people are all the time. Who among us has not felt grief and sorrow as a result of the calamities we see befalling the Muslims, day after day? Who among us has not lost interest in this world and everything in it, because of what we hear or see? But when these feelings of sadness and loneliness or bad moods persist and prevent us from living a normal life or carrying out the duties that are required of us, or fulfilling the rights of others, or they cause us to neglect the blessings of Allah which He has bestowed upon us and fail to give thanks for as we should, at that point sadness moves from being something natural to being a case of weakness and sickness that needs to be treated. There is no greater remedy for that than patience and fearing Allah, and thinking positively of Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, putting one’s trust in Him, delegating one’s affairs to Him and turning to Him in all times of calamity. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Many people, when they see evil or when the Muslim ummah goes through a lot of trouble, panic, lose hope and start complaining as people who are beset by calamities do. But this is forbidden; rather what is enjoined is to be patient, to put one’s trust in Allah, to be steadfast in adhering to the religion of Islam and to believe that Allah is with those who fear Him and those who do good, and that the best end is for those who fear Him; whatever befalls him is because of his sins, so he should be patient, for the promise of Allah is true; he should seek forgiveness for his sins and glorify and praise his Lord morning and evening. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 18/295 Secondly: If the state of grief worsens and leads to some level of depression, then in addition to this spiritual remedy, showing patience, putting one’s trust in Allah and always remembering Him, medical attention from a knowledgeable and trustworthy specialist is also needed. The symptoms of depression include the following: · always feeling sad, anxious and in a bad mood · loss of interest and lack of enjoyment in activities that people usually enjoy · constant pessimism and feeling helpless in the face of life’s problems · feelings of guilt, worthlessness and social alienation · inability to show or express feelings towards others or to accept feelings from others · trouble sleeping, such as insomnia, sleeping too long or waking up too early · eating problems (overeating or loss of appetite) · chronic physical pain from which no remedy brings relief · weepiness · getting tense quickly; hyperactivity and not being able to calm down and relax · constant feelings of tiredness and inability to do any physical activity · inability to concentrate, remember or take sound decisions If four or more of the symptoms mentioned above are present, then you should consult a specialist in psychology, as mentioned above. In addition to seeking medical treatment, you should try to keep yourself busy with useful activities, such as reading Quran and other books, and engaging in hobbies and so on. Do not forget some natural remedies that will re-energise you and help the brain to regain energy, such as honey and dried fruits. One of the prescriptions that was often used in the past is talbeenah. According to an authentic report, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said concerning it: “Talbeenah brings comfort to the sick person and it lessens grief.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5101; Muslim, 2216 Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Ma‘ad: This broth clears that from the stomach and intestines, cleanses it, makes it flow, makes it more liquid, adjusts it, and restores balance. Thus it gives relief, especially for the one who usually eats barley bread, which was the custom of the people of Madinah at that time; it was their staple food, as wheat was very expensive for them. And Allah knows best. Talbeenah is a broth made from barley flour with its bran, to which a cup of water is added, and it is heated on a low fire for five minutes, then a cup of milk and a spoonful of honey is added. Please see also the answers to questions no. 158533 and 45847 And Allah knows best."
266,Ruling on hair transplants if the follicles are taken from someone else,"Question I have read the answers to questions having to do with the ruling on hair transplants. My question is: is it permissible to transplant hair from another person, not in the form of a wig, but transplanting natural hair by taking hair from someone else?","Praise be to Allah.A hair transplant involves transferring hair follicles from one area to another, and there is nothing wrong with that, because it is correcting a defect, not changing the creation of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. In a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), issued during its eighteenth session in Malaysia, 24-29 Jumaada al-Aakhirah 1428 AH/4-9 July 2007 CE, concerning cosmetic procedures, explaining what types of procedures are permissible, it says: Correcting acquired defects that result from burns, accidents, illness and so on, such as skin grafts, dermabrasion, breast reconstruction following mastectomy, breast reshaping if the breasts are so large or so small that it leads to sickness, and hair transplants in the case of hair loss, especially for women. End quote. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Hair transplants may be done for one who is affected by baldness, by taking hair from the back of the head and transplanting it to the affected area. Is that permissible? He replied: Yes, that is permissible, because this comes under the heading of restoring what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, had created, and also under the heading of correcting a defect. It does not come under the heading of beautification or adding to what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has created, so it does not come under the heading of changing the creation of Allah; rather it comes under the heading of restoring what has been lost and removing a defect. There is the well-known story of the three men, one of whom had become bald and said that he would like Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to restore his hair, so the angel touched him and Allah restored his hair, and gave him beautiful hair. End quote from Fataawa ‘Ulamaa’ al-Balad al-Haraam, p. 1185. The hadith to which the shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) referred was narrated by al-Bukhaari (3277) and Muslim (2964). What appears to be the case is that there is no difference between taking hair follicles from the individual himself or from someone else. And Allah knows best."
267,This woman is not your mahram,Question I would like to know what is my relationship to my brother-in-laws (wife's brother) wife. She calls me brother and I treat her like my sister. Is this allowed in Islam. Please advice.,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for you to treat your wife’s brother’s wife as your sister, because she is not one of your mahrams. So it is not permissible for her to appear before you without proper hijab, and it is not permissible for you to be alone with her, or to shake hands with her, or to look at her, or to speak to her except from behind a screen, when there is no fear of fitnah (temptation). Allaah has forbidden the believing women to show their adornment except to specific people. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” [al-Noor 24:31] You are not one of the people mentioned in the aayah, so this ruling does not apply to you. And Allaah knows best. See also question no. 5538."
268,Circumcision for men,Question Is circumcision mandatory for the man who adopts Islam? What is the Islamic rule on female circumcision?,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. To the dear inquirer: We appreciate the question you have submitted, as it is an issue which is truly among those which may pose a hindrance in some cases for those who wish to adopt Islaam. In reality the issue is really simpler than many may think. Male circumcision is among the rites of Islaam and is part of the fitrah, or the innate disposition and natural character and instinct of the human creation, and is from the religion of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allaah has said (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then we revealed to you (the command) to follow the pure and uncorrupted religion of Ibrahim."" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ""The Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) was circumcisized when he was eighty years old."" (Al-Bukhari, Vol 6/p. 388, Al-Salfiyya printing). Male circumcision is obligatory for the Muslim male if he is able to do it. If, however, he is unable, whether due to fear of injury or if a respected and authoritative doctor has told him he will experience profuse bleeding which may make his life miserable, then the obligation for cirumcision is waived and he does not commit a sin by not having it done. It is not permissible under any circumstance for the issue to become a hindrance for a person wanting to accept Islaam. The validity of one's acceptance of Islaam is not dependent on his performance of circumcision and it is valid for one to adopt Islaam even if he has not had himself circumcized. Regarding the issue of female circumcision, please refer to question # 328. I ask Allaah to bring you success in all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad ."
269,"If someone appointed him to do Hajj on his behalf, which type of Hajj should he choose?","Question We know that Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, and there are those who die or fall sick before they are able to do this obligatory duty. Hence there is the custom of hiring someone else to do this obligatory duty on behalf of the one who has died or is sick. Which is the most appropriate type of Hajj in this case, is it qiraan or tamattu‘ or ifraad, and why?","Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the one who is appointed to do something on behalf of someone else is entrusted with that task, which dictates that he should carry out the task in the manner that is in the best interests of the one who appointed him, and that which is in the best interests of the one who appointed him in this case is that he should do tamattu‘ on his behalf, as this is what would be in his best interests if he was doing Hajj himself. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: We set out declaring our intention to do Hajj, then when we came to Makkah, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to make it ‘umrah [to be followed by Hajj, i.e., tamattu‘]. He said: “If I had known before what I know now, I would have made it ‘umrah, but I have brought the sacrificial animal with me, so I will do Hajj and ‘umrah together (qiraan).” Narrated by Ahmad (12044); the hadith is also narrated in as-Saheehayn. So if the one who appointed him or hired him stipulated that he should do a particular type of Hajj, then he must adhere to what the one who appointed him stipulated. See also the answer to question no. 1745 . And Allah knows best."
270,Medical test to prove wife’s virginity,Question Is it permissible for us to do a routine test to prove virginity?,"Praise be to Allah.If what is meant is a medical examination to prove virginity, there is nothing wrong with that if it is needed and is requested by the husband, especially if there is some element of suspicion. It may become a must if there is no other way of resolving the matter."
271,Ruling on a woman’s continual discharge,Question I have a continual discharge – how can I pray?,"Praise be to Allah. If this discharge comes and goes, and usually stops during the times of prayer, then you can delay the prayer until the time when this discharge ceases, so long as there is no fear that the time for the prayer may come to an end. If you fear that the time for prayer will end, then do wudoo’, apply a pad of cotton, and pray."
272,Using the placenta for medical purposes,Question I am going to give birth soon and the doctor told me that she wants to keep the umbilical blood. She said that it can be used to treat many diseases. This is the first time I have heard such a thing and I did not know what the Islamic opinion is concerning that. I hope that you can advise me about that. Should I agree to that or not? She told me that it is my choice.,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using the umbilical cord or the placenta for medical purposes. We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him): What is the ruling on keeping the placenta to treat cancer and remove wrinkles from the face? He replied as follows: It seems that there is nothing wrong with it so long as it is proven (to be beneficial). Question: Does the principle that “whatever is cut from a living being is ‘dead meat’ (maytah)” apply?” Answer: The maytah of a human is taahir (pure). Question: If it has no use, does it have to be buried or can it be thrown anywhere? Answer: It would seem that it is similar to nails and hair – i.e., there is nothing wrong with either throwing it away or burying it. And Allah knows best."
273,"Ruling on what is known as “khatam shifa”, and praying behind an innovator and calling him (to the right path)","Question My bother just had an operation and his situation is critical. So, what my mom decided to do is perform khatam shifa which is basically saying ya salaamu 12500 times, reading some dua, reading Surah Yaseen and Surah Ar-Rahman 40 times each, feeding the poor and giving away goats. Is is something from our Rasul Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. Another question is regarding the mosques in Bangladesh. They do a lot of bidah that includes asking wasillah, teaching acts mentioned above, celebrate milad in nabi and I can keep going on for ages. Is it permissible to pray behind those imams who teaches such things? Sometimes, when I try to talk to them, whether they get angry and they do not reason and give sahih daleel to their arguments. They always say that some alims taught them and they are better than us and we should follow them without question. We are facing this diellma to either be quiet and allow them to follow what they will. Sometimes it ends in quarrel and at times ruins relationships/friendship.... because as much as we try they always say that the alim is far better and knows what he is preaching. Finally, what should I do to explain my family and friends?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: With regard to what is called “khatam shifa”, it is an innovation (bid‘ah). The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The worst of matters are those which are newly invented (in religion). Every newly invented matter is an innovation, every innovation is a going astray, and every going astray is in the Fire.” With regard to these soorahs and adhkaar (dhikrs) that are mentioned in the question, this is something for which there is no evidence (daleel), and it is not permissible to do these things for which there is no evidence in the Book of our Lord or the Sunnah of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What is prescribed in our religion is to offer supplication (du‘aa’) for the sick person and to ask Allah to heal him and purify him. That will have the greatest impact in taking away the disease and bringing about rapid healing. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever visits a sick person whose time (of death) has not yet come, and says to him seven times ‘As’al Allah al-‘Azeem Rabb al-‘Arsh al-‘Azeem an yashfeeyaka (I ask Allah the Almighty, Lord of the Mighty Throne, to heal you)’, Allah will heal him of that sickness.” Narrated by Ahmad (2137), Abu Dawood (3106) and at-Tirmidhi (2083); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. So you should offer supplication (du‘aa’) for him in the wording mentioned in this hadeeth and other saheeh hadeeths. The same applies to giving charity. There is no doubt that spending for the sake of Allah is something that brings good. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no day on which people wake up, but two angels come down and one of them says: ‘O Allaah, give more to the one who spends,’ and the other says, ‘O Allaah, send destruction upon the one who withholds.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1442) and Muslim (1010). So spend and give charity, and be optimistic about compensation from Allah, may He be glorified. Secondly: With regard to praying behind an innovator, Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (23/355): With regard to praying behind an innovator, this is a matter concerning which there is a difference of opinion and it is subject to further discussion. If you cannot find any other imam apart from him, such as in the case of Jumu‘ah prayer which is only held in one place, or Eid prayer, or prayers during Hajj behind the imam who is in charge of Hajj, these prayers are to be offered behind anyone, whether he is righteous or otherwise, according to the consensus of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah. Rather the ones who refrain from offering these prayers behind the imams are the followers of innovations such as the Raafidis and others like them, who do not attend any Jumu‘ah prayer or prayer in congregation. If there is only one mosque in the village, then praying in congregation behind an immoral person is better than praying on one’s own at home, lest that lead to giving up prayer in congregation altogether. But if it is possible to pray behind someone other than the innovator, that is undoubtedly better and preferable. But if he prays behind him, there is a scholarly difference of opinion concerning his prayer. The view of ash-Shaafa‘i and Abu Haneefah is that his prayer is valid; however in the madhhabs of Maalik and Ahmad there is a dispute concerning this issue and it is subject to further discussion. However this only applies to bid‘ah that is known to be contrary to the Qur’an and Sunnah, such as the innovations of the Raafidis, Jahamis and so on. People argue about many issue of religion in this country, and both parties to an argument may innovators, and both of them may be ignorant and misinterpreting things, so the refusal of one of them to pray behind the other is not better than if it is the other way round. But once the Sunnah is established and becomes known, and one person or group goes against it, this is the matter concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion. And Allah knows best. End quote. In Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (7/364) there is the following question: Is it permissible to pray behind an imam who is an innovator? The committee replied: Whoever can find an imam who is not an innovator should pray behind him and not behind the innovator. Whoever cannot find anyone except this innovator should advise him in the hope that he will give up his innovation. If he does not accept that advice, and his innovation involves shirk, such as those who seek the help of the dead or call upon them instead of Allah, or offer sacrifices to them, then he (the one who offered advice) should not pray behind him because he is a kaafir and his prayer is invalid, and it is not right to appoint him as an imam. If his innovation does not make him a kaafir, such as uttering the intention out loud, his prayer is valid as is the prayer of those who pray behind him. End quote. With regard to calling these people (da‘wah) and advising them, seek the help of Allah first and foremost, make your intention sincere and intend to guide them to the right path, and Allah will help you in that. You should explain to them that they are going against the teachings of Islam, with evidence and proof, and demonstrate that the specious argument they follow is wrong; you should also refer to scholars concerning issues that you are uncertain about, so that their specious arguments will not affect you and they will not defeat you in argument, lest the ignorant think that their view is correct. And you should pay attention to being kind and gentle in all of that. And Allah knows best."
274,Ruling on using vessels of steel that look like silver,Question What is the ruling on metal vessels that are made of stainless steel which looks like silver but is not silver?,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The vessels that are haraam are vessels made of gold or silver only. That is because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (5426) and Muslim (2067) from Hudhayfah, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not drink from vessels of gold or silver, and do not eat from plates made of the same. They are for them in this world and for us in the hereafter.” It was narrated from Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who drinks from a vessel of silver is gulping the fire of Hell into his belly.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5634) and Muslim (2065). According to Muslim (2065): “Whoever drinks from a vessel of gold or silver is only gulping fire from Hell into his belly.” These hadiths clearly indicate that it is haraam to eat or drink from vessels of gold or silver, such as spoons, plates, cups and the like. This ruling applies equally to both men and women. An-Nawawi said: The Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is prohibited to eat or drink from vessels of gold and vessels of silver, for both men and women.""(Sharh Saheeh Muslim 14/29). please see the answer to question no. 13733 . Secondly: With regard to all other kinds of vessels, they are permissible, whether they are made of wood, iron, copper, steel, porcelain, glass or anything else. This ruling also applies to vessels made of precious metals and other things. The fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) specifically prohibited gold and silver implies that other things are permissible. Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi said: With regard to all other kinds of vessels, it is permissible to keep them and use them, whether they are valuable, such as rubies, crystal, garnet, sapphires or blown glass, or they are non-precious, such as wood, earthenware and leather. It is not disliked (makrooh) to use any of them, according to the majority of scholars… And it is not valid to compare them to gold and silver for two reasons: 1.. They are only known to the elite of the people, and poor people will not recognize them so that will not sadden the poor people, unlike gold and silver. 2.. Because these other precious materials are rare, vessels are not made from them except in very rare cases, so the fact that they are permissible will not lead to it becoming common for people to keep them and use them.""(Al-Mughni 1/105). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: It is permissible to keep and use all other kinds of vessels that are pure, whether they are valuable, such as rubies, glass and carnelian, or they are not valuable. … The prohibition applies only to the two precious metals [gold and silver], not to things that resemble them. That is because these precious materials are only known to the elite of the people, and people do not usually use them for vessels, so that will not lead to extravagance or pride or arrogance. Even if that happened, then what is prohibited would be that pride and arrogance, just as if it happened as a result of permissible actions or acts of worship and obedience.""(Sharh ‘Umdat al-Fiqh 1/118). The fact that the vessels resemble gold or silver in colour is not a reason to deem them prohibited, so long as neither of them is included in the materials of which the vessels are manufactured, and remains visible with its characteristics in the vessel, in such a way that gold or silver is regarded as a visible component of it. And Allah knows best."
275,Ruling on one who commits zina after doing the marriage contract and before consummation of the marriage,"Question There is a young man who married a young woman, but she is still living in her family’s home and the marriage has not been consummated with her. Her father gave her the mahr in full, according to local tradition and custom. But the girl fell into zina and became pregnant as a result. The hadd punishment was carried out on her and on the one who committed zina with her, namely one hundred lashes, according to the text of the Holy Qur’an, and banishment for one hijri year. Then we separated her from her husband, and ruled that the entire mahr that her father took must be returned. We quoted as evidence for that the hadeeth of Abu Dawood, who narrated it in Kitaab an-Nikaah (the Book of Maariage), when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ordered that a woman who was pregnant as a result of zina be given one hundred lashes, and he said: “She is entitled to the mahr for what she permitted of intimacy with her.” And he separated them. In this case, the husband did not have any intimacy with his wife at all. Our question is: did we do the right thing in ruling that the entire mahr taken by the father in his daughter’s name should be returned, and we said that she is not entitled to any mahr, because of the apparent meaning of the hadeeth quoted above?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: If a woman commits zina before consummation of her marriage, then she is to be treated in the same manner as a virgin with regard to the hadd punishment, because the description of having been previously married, in which case the hadd punishment is stoning, does not come into effect merely with the drawing up of the marriage contract, even if the spouses have been alone together in addition to having done the marriage contract. Rather it is essential that vaginal intercourse should have occurred, as we have explained in fatwa no. 120913 The hadd punishment for an unmarried woman, if she commits zina, is one hundred lashes. The basis for that is the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “The woman and the man guilty of illegal sexual intercourse, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.” [an-Noor 24:2]. To that may be added banishment for one each year; this is proven according to the Sunnah. It was narrated that ‘Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Learn from me, learn from me. Allah has ordained a way for them. For an unmarried person with an unmarried person, one hundred lashes and exile for one year. For a married person with a married person, one hundred lashes and stoning.” Narrated by Muslim (1690), Abu Dawood (4415) and at-Tirmidhi (1434). This is the view of the majority of scholars, even though some of them differed concerning that. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that there was a difference of opinion concerning that, and he quoted the evidence of those who say that the woman is not to be banished. He said: In addition to flogging, the zaani is to be banished for one year, according to the majority of scholars. That was narrated from the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and it was the view of Ubayy, Ibn Mas‘ood and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), as well as ‘Ata’, Tawoos, ath-Thawri, Ibn Abi Layla, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ishaaq and Abu Thawr. Maalik and al-Awzaa‘i said: Only the man is to be exiled and not the woman, because the woman needs to be guarded and protected, and because her exile will be either with or without a mahram, and it is not permissible for her to be exiled without a mahram, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel the distance of one day and one night except with a mahram.” Moreover, exiling her without a mahram exposes her to temptation and may be the cause of her being neglected. However, if she is exiled with a mahram, that is exiling someone who did not commit zina and banishing someone who did not commit a sin, even if she is forced to give him money in return. Doing that is adding to the punishment something that is not prescribed. End quote from al-Mughni (9/43) The correct view concerning this matter is that a woman may be exiled if she has a mahram with her, because the hadeeths that speak of exile are general in meaning and include everyone who commits zina, whether man or woman. An-Nawawi said in his commentary on the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah quoted above: With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) “and he is to be banished for one year”, this gives proof for ash-Shaafa‘i and the majority of scholars, who said that punishment for one year is obligatory, whether the guilty party is a man or a woman. End quote from Sharh an-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim (11/189) But if she does not have a mahram, then that she is not to be banished, because banishing her in that case would be exposing her to temptation and encouraging her to deviate. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: She is to be banished for one year, so long as she has a mahram, and she is to be banished to a safe place. The fuqaha’ of the (four) madhhabs are of the view that she is to be banished, even if she has no mahram. The second view is the one that is more correct, that she should not be banished if she is on her own. That is because the purpose behind banishment is to keep her away from temptation, but if she is exiled on her own, that is more likely to lead to temptation and evil, because she has no one with her to check her, and because if she is exiled without a mahram – especially if she needs money – then she may end up selling her honour so that she can eat and drink. The correct view is that if she does not have a mahram, it is not permissible for her to be exiled. But what should we do? Some of the scholars said that she should be taken out to a nearby town, within the distance at which shortening prayers become permissible, and her guardian should be instructed to keep an eye on her. But the correct view is that there is no need for that, and she should remain in her own city. It was also said that she should be detained in a safe place. Detention in this case takes the place of exile. That is because she will not get in touch with anyone and no one will get in touch with her and this opinion carries some weight. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustaqni‘ (14/237) Secondly: It is not necessary to separate a woman who committed zina and her husband, whether she committed zina before or after consummation of the marriage, because marriage is not rendered invalid by zina. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man’s wife commits zina, or her husband commits zina, the marriage is not annulled, whether that occurred before consummation of the marriage or afterwards, according to most of the scholars. End quote from al-Mughni (9/565). Thirdly: If the husband chooses to separate from his wife who committed zina before consummation of the marriage, then he must divorce her (talaaq), and if he divorces her then she is entitled to half of the agreed-upon mahr, because Allah , may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the Mahr (bridal money given by the husbands to his wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (Mahr), unless they (the women) agree to forego it, or he (the husband), in whose hands is the marriage tie, agrees to forego and give her full appointed Mahr” [al-Baqarah 2:237]. It is permissible for the husband to prevent her marrying someone else by refusing to divorce her or consummate the marriage with her, so that she will release herself from him by giving wealth, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the Mahr you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse. And live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good” [an-Nisa’ 4:19]. The “open illegal sexual intercourse” mentioned in the verse is zina, as we have explained in detail in fatwa no. 146100. And Allah knows best."
276,A man mistreated his mother and he said bad words about him,"Question If someone has badly treated with my mother,and when i got to know about it,i said bad words for that man because of his this action;is this backbitting(gheeba)?.","Praise be to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described gheebah (backbiting) as being “Your mentioning about your brother something that he dislikes.” If the quality that is disliked is not actually present, then it is a lie, and both of them are haraam. Muslim (2589) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do you know what backbiting is?” They said: Allaah and His Messenger know best. He said: “When you say about your brother something that he dislikes.” They said: What if what I say about my brother is true? He said: “If it is true then you have backbitten about him and if it is not true then you have told a grave lie about him.” Based on this, your saying bad things about this person in his absence must be either backbiting or lying, so what you have to do is repent to Allaah and resolve not to do this again. Part of repenting fully is striving to correct your feelings towards him, praying for forgiveness for him and mentioning his good qualities before those in whose presence you spoke ill of him. See the answer to question no. 52807. This applies if the words were said in his absence. But if they were said in his presence, then this comes under the heading of reviling, insulting and rudeness, which is also haraam, so long as there was no retaliation, i.e., responding to bad words in kind without overstepping the mark. That is because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof; but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allaah. Verily, He likes not the Zaalimoon (oppressors, polytheists, and wrongdoers). 41. And indeed whosoever takes revenge after he has suffered wrong, for such there is no way (of blame) against them. 42. The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress men and rebel in the earth without justification; for such there will be a painful torment. 43. And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allaah” [al-Shoora 42:40-43] And Muslim (2587) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When two people revile one another, the one who starts it is the sinner, so long as the one who is wronged does not overstep the mark.” It says in Subul al-Salaam (2/675): The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to respond in kind to the one who insulted one first, and that the sin of that will come back on the one who started it, because he is the cause of everything that the one who is answering back says, unless the one who is answering back oversteps the mark, in which case the sin of aggression is borne by him, because the permission is granted to respond only to the same extent as the initial offence: “The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof” [al-Shoora 42:4] and “Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him” [al-Baqarah 2:194]. But not responding in kind, being patient and putting up with it is better. It is proven that a man reviled Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr kept quiet whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting there. When Abu Bakr responded, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) got up and left. He was asked about that and he said: “When Abu Bakr kept quiet there was an angel responding on his behalf, but when he stood up for himself, the shaytaan came,” or words to that effect. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allaah” [al-Shoora 42:40-43] End quote. But if you respond to this mistreatment by speaking and acting kindly towards him, and being gentle and nice, and obey Allaah with regard to him when he disobeys Him with regard to you, that is the status of people of a high level of taqwa (piety), which only a few can attain. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allaah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. 35. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient — and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world” [Fussilat 41:34-35] May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows best."
277,Selling posters and frames of Qur’aanic verses,Question what is the view on people who take parts/quotes from the Qu'ran and sell them in frames/posters/books for profit? Where the profit obtained goes towards aiding an Islamic event/organisation/school/society?,"Praise be to Allah. We appreciate your keenness to acquire knowledge and ask about issues having to do with calling people to Allah, because calling people without knowledge of Islam may do more harm than good. With regard to selling these frames and posters, the ruling on selling them will become clear once you understand the ruling on hanging up these items. Hanging up frames and cloths containing verses from the Qur’an in homes, schools, clubs, stores and businesses involves a number of things that are objectionable and contrary to Islamic teaching, including the following: 1. They are usually hung up for the purpose of adornment and decorating walls with engravings of verses and adhkaar that are colourfully adorned, and this is diverting the Qur’an from the purpose for which it was revealed, which was to guide, offer beautiful exhortation, to be recited regularly, and so on. The Qur’an was not revealed to adorn walls; rather it was revealed to guide mankind and the jinn. 2. Many people hang up these things for the purpose of seeking blessing (barakah) from them, which is an innovation. The manner of seeking blessing or barakah that is prescribed is by reading the Qur’an, not by hanging it up or putting it on shelves and turning it into frames and 3-D objects. 3. That is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them) who succeeded him. They did not do that, and all good is in following them, not in introducing innovations. Rather history bears witness in the lands of Andalusia, Turkey and elsewhere, that adornment and making these plaques and decorations, and carving verses into the walls of houses and mosques only occurs during periods of Muslim weakness and decline. 4. Hanging up these things is a means that leads to shirk, because some people regard these frames and hangings as amulets that protect the house and its occupants from evil and troubles. This is a shirki belief that is haraam. The One Who actually gives protection is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and one of the means of seeking His protection is to recite Qur’an and adhkaar with humble focus and certain faith. 5. Writing these things comes under the heading of using the Qur’an as a means for business and earning more money. The Qur’an should be protected from being subjected to such things. It is well-known that in some cases, buying these frames comes under the heading of extravagance and wasteful spending. 6. Many of these frames are plated with gold, which makes it more emphatically prohibited to use them or hang them up. 7. In some cases, these frames clearly reflect tampering or toying with the text, such as writing in very complex and elaborate styles which do not benefit anyone, because they can hardly be read. Some of them are written in the shape of a bird or a man who is prostrating, and other kinds of images of animate beings, which it is prohibited to produce. 8. It is exposing the verses and soorahs of the Qur’an to mishandling and disrespectful treatment. For example, when moving from one house to another, they are piled up with other kinds of furnishings, and other things may be placed on top of them. Such things may also happen when taking them down to paint the walls or clean the house. This is in addition to the fact that they may be hung up in places where acts of disobedience to Allah may be committed, and no attention is paid to the sanctity and dignified status of the Qur’an. 9. Some Muslims who fall short in a religious commitment may hang them up to make them feel that they are undertaking some religious matters, so as to reduce the guilt they feel, even though these things do not avail them anything. To sum up, we should close the door to evil and follow that which was the practice of the leaders of guidance in the first generations, whose people the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) testified are the best of the Muslims in their beliefs and all their religious rulings. Moreover, if someone were to say “we will never show disrespect towards them, and we will never make them a mere adornment, and we will never exaggerate concerning them; we only intend for them to remind the people in their gatherings,” our response to that is that if we look at real life, will we find that this really happens? Do the people who sit there remember Allah or do they read the verses that are hanging there if they happen to lift their heads and look at them? Reality tells us that this does not happen; rather what happens is the opposite. In how many rooms where verses are hanging up do the people sitting there do the opposite of what is hanging above their heads, and they tell lies, backbite, mock others, and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some people who may benefit from it, they are very few and that does not affect the ruling on this matter. The Muslims should turn to the Book of Allah, read it and act upon what is in it. We ask Allah to make the Holy Qur’an the comfort and light of our hearts and a means to console us in our grief and take away our worries. What I have said above is a summary of what is mentioned in fatwas issued by the senior scholars of the current era, such as Shaykh Ibn Baaz and the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas in the Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia), and by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, as in the fatwa issued by the Standing Committee under the leadership of Shaykh Ibn Baaz, fatwas no. 2078 and 17659. Based on the above, you should not sell these frames, because by doing so you may end up committing some infractions that have been mentioned by the scholars, and you may be a cause of other people falling into some such things. We ask Allah to guide us and you."
278,Speaking the intention for Hajj and ‘Umrah out loud,"Question Given that speaking the intention (niyyah) out loud is haraam, what is the ruling on speaking the intention for Hajj and ‘Umrah out loud?.","Praise be to Allah.The place for the intention is the heart, and speaking it out loud is bid’ah. It was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions spoke the intention for any act of worship out loud. The Talbiyah in Hajj and ‘Umrah is not the intention. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Speaking the intention is a bid’ah (innovation) and doing so loudly is even more sinful. Rather the Sunnah is to make one's intention in the heart, because Allaah knows that which is secret and what is even more hidden. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: Will you inform Allaah of your religion while Allaah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth?” [al-Hujuraat 49:16] It was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the Sahaabah or any of the most prominent imams that they spoke the intention out loud. From this we may understand that it is not prescribed, rather it is an innovation that has been introduced into the religion. And Allaah is the Source of strength. Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/315 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke the intention out loud, whether for prayer, wudoo’, fasting or any other act of worship. Even in Hajj and ‘Umrah he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not say, when he wanted to do Hajj and ‘Umrah, “O Allaah, I intend to do so and so.” It is not narrated that he did that or that he told any of his companions to do that. The most that has been narrated concerning that is that Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with her) asked him for advice, saying that she wanted to do Hajj but she was feeling unwell. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: “Do Hajj and put a condition saying, ‘I will exit ihraam at the place where You cause me to fall ill,’ because your condition is valid before Allaah.’” In this case it is acceptable to speak out loud because resolving to do Hajj is like a vow, and a vow is spoken out loud, because if a person intends to make a vow in his heart, that is not a vow and is not counted as a vow. Because Hajj is like a vow and must be completed once started, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Dubaa’ah to say her condition out loud and say, “If something prevents me from completing my Hajj, then the place of my exiting ihraam is the place where You cause me to be unable to proceed further.” With regard to what is proven in the hadeeth, that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Jibreel came to me and said, ‘Pray in this blessed valley, and say, ‘Umrah fi Hijjah or ‘Umrah wa Hijjah [‘Umrah and Hajj],’” that does not mean that he was speaking the intention out loud, rather what it means is that he was mentioning the acts of worship in his Talbiyah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not speak his intention out loud. Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/216 And Allaah knows best."
279,Can You Pray without a Prayer Mat?,Question What is the ruling on praying on prayer mats? What is the ruling on putting a prayer mat in the mosque for the imam to pray on? Is this bid`ah? May Allah reward you with good.,"Praise be to Allah.Offering prayer on a prayer mat Offering prayer on a prayer mat is permissible in principle. Al-Bukhari (379) and Muslim (513) narrated that Maymunah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray on a khumrah. A khumrah is a small mat made of palm leaves that is big enough for the face, on which a worshipper may prostrate to protect himself from the heat or coldness of the ground. Al-Khattabi favoured the view that the khumrah may be bigger than that, and he quoted as evidence the report narrated by Abu Dawud (5247) from Ibn 'Abbas, who said: A mouse came and started dragging the wick of the lamp and threw it in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), on the khumrah on which he was sitting, and it burned an area the size of a dirham… (This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 4369.) It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud: “This clearly shows that the word khumrah may apply to a large mat. This was also stated in al-Nihayah.” (See Fath al-Bari, 333) Al-Shawkani said: “This hadith indicates that there is nothing wrong with praying on a mat, regardless of whether it is made of rags, palm leaves or anything else, whether it is small or big, like a mat or carpet, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed on mats, carpets and animal pelts. Cases where it is not permissible to pray on carpets But there may be some reasons why it is not permissible to pray on carpets and similar things. For example: If the carpet contains images of animate beings; in which case it is haram to keep them and the images must be blotted out. Please see question no. 12422 . If the carpet has decorations and patterns that attract the attention of the worshipper and distract him from his prayer; praying on such carpets is makruh. The Standing Committee said: “With regard to pictures of inanimate objects such as mountains, rivers, lakes, plants, trees, houses and so on, so long as there are no images of living beings in or around them, these are permissible, but praying on them is makruh because they distract the worshipper and detract from his proper focus and humility (khushu’) in prayer, but his prayer is still valid.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 6/180) They also said: “The mosques are the houses of Allah, built for the establishment of prayer and the glorification of Allah and the fear of Allah. Patterns and decorations in the furnishings and on the walls of the mosques are things that distract the heart from the remembrance of Allah and take away much of the worshippers’ proper focus and humility. Hence they were regarded as makruh by many of the salaf. So the Muslims should avoid that in their mosques and strive to make their worship perfect by keeping distractions away from the places in which they seek to draw close to Allah the Lord of the Worlds, hoping to increase their reward. But with regard to praying (on carpets decorated with such patterns ), it is valid.” If praying on the rug is done in order to avoid praying on the ground. Al-Bukhari (2036) narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We observed i'tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the middle ten days of Ramadan, and we came out on the morning of the twentieth. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the morning of the twentieth and said: “I was shown Laylat al-Qadr but then I was made to forget it, so seek it in the last ten nights, on the odd-numbered nights. I saw that I was prostrating in water and mud. Whoever was observing i’tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), let him go back.” So the people went back to the mosque, and we did not see any trace of a cloud in the sky. Then a cloud came and it rained, and the iqamah for prayer was given, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated in mud and water until we saw the marks of mud on the tip of his nose and his face. According to a report narrated by Muslim (1167): “And his forehead was covered with mud and water.” This hadith points to the humility of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as he prostrated on water and mud, and he did not order that something be brought for him to prostrate on. If praying on the rug is done to avoid praying on the carpets that are spread for all the people in the mosque, or if a person does that to be on the safe side because there may be some impurity (najasah) on the ground. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “With regard to those who suffer from extreme waswasah (whispers from the Shaytan), they do not pray on the ground or on the carpets spread out for everyone on the ground, rather they pray on a rug or something similar…” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/177) If a man seeks to pray on the rug because he thinks that it is essential to have a rug just for prayer and that he has to pray on something whether he is at home or in the mosque. Many people only ever pray on the rug even if the house is carpeted. Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Praying on rugs, in the sense that the worshipper insists on that – this was not the way of the salaf, the Muhajirin and Ansar and those who followed them in truth at the time of the Messenger of Allah. Rather they used to pray on the ground in his mosque, and none of them had a rug that was used just for prayer. It was narrated that when ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi came to Madinah he spread out a rug, and Malik ordered that it be taken away. It was said to him, “He is ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi.” Malik said, “Do you not know that spreading a rug in our mosque is bid’ah (an innovation)?”’ ( Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/163) The same applies to the practice in many mosques of having a rug that is just for the imam, which is set out for him to pray on, even though the mosque is carpeted. Why is he distinguished from the other worshippers?? This is not appropriate because there is no need for it, and because that may make him feel somewhat superior to the people. The point is that putting down rugs in a carpeted mosque is a bid`ah unless there is a reason for that, such as it being very cold, or the floor being rough or the first carpet being impure or filthy, and so on. And Allah knows best."
280,Is it permissible to give a kaafir any of the udhiyah meat?,Question Is it permissible to give a kaafir any of the udhiyah meat?.,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: It is permissible to give a kaafir some of the udhiyah meat in charity so long as this kaafir is not one of those who are killing the Muslims. If he is one of those who are killing them, then he should not be given anything, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity. It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers those who disobey Allaah)” [al-Mumtahanah 60:8-9]"
281,What is the ruling on putting cream on the thighs to prevent chafing when in ihram?,"Question What is the ruling on putting cream on the thighs to prevent chafing after entering ihram for ‘umrah? Please note that this cream, like all other creams, has a scent but it is not a scent like perfume.","Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 20019 we stated that what is forbidden during ihram is putting on perfume or anything that has a scent. If the cream mentioned does not have any scent, then there is nothing wrong with using it. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, vol. 2 (10/157): During tawaaf and sa‘i in Hajj and ‘Umrah, people often use creams to reduce the chafing between the thighs; as using perfume is one of the things that are forbidden when in ihram, is using Daktacort [a hydrocortisone cream] in this case permissible or not? A sample of this cream in attached They replied: There is nothing wrong with using Daktacort cream – a sample of which was attached – and similar creams when wearing ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah, and it is not haram, because it is a kind of remedy and it is not a kind of perfume, so it does not come under the ruling on perfume. End quote. Based on that, it is permissible for the pilgrim in ihram to use creams on that area to prevent chafing, because the purpose here is using it as a remedy. And Allah knows best."
282,"Someone has proposed marriage to a girl, and she is asking whether she can meet him with a non-Muslim chaperone, because she is cut off from her family","Question I have a question concerning marriage.I am a sister who was born a Muslim but was not raised one.It wasnt until about last year that I embraced Islam.Now,there is a brother who has expressed interest in marrying me but the issue of me not having a wali has arisen(I have had no kind of contact with my father in over 5 years)I refuse to go into marriage talks with a brother or go through with anything without a wali.The brother has also said that it would be best if we met a few times before anything was finalised but I made it clear to him that I will not be meeting without an appropriate chaperone. I know that I could get an imam to act as my wali but as far as the chaperone goes, I am not too sure who I can have as one. Unfortunately, the area I live in right now, has almost no Muslims and most of the people I do speak to are not Muslim. In Sha Allah I will be in a better position Islamically in a few months but I am still not sure who could act as a chaperone. I told the brother that I would rather the chaperone be a Muslim but he told me that that was not the case and that I could ask anyone that I trusted even if they werent Muslim. I was wondering if it is permissable to have a non Muslim as a chaperone...I do not feel comfortable with the idea but he insists it is okay. I know I have made quite a few missteps in this entire process and achnowledge my errors and I ask Allah to forgive me for them.","Praise be to Allah.We congratulate you for what Allah has bestowed upon you of guidance and enabling you to adhere to the rulings, teachings morals and manners of Islam. We ask Allah, may He be glorified, to help you to always adhere to the commands of Allah, may He be glorified, and to divert from you the evil of the devils among mankind and the jinn. With regard to marriage to this person or anyone else, it is not permissible without a guardian (wali), because having a guardian is one of the conditions of the marriage contract being valid, as has been explained previously in fatwa no. 99696. The fact that you have been cut off from your father for a while is not an excuse for marrying without a guardian. This is in addition to the fact that your forsaking your father for this length of time is something that is haraam; in fact it is a major sin because of what it involves of disobedience towards him and severing of family ties. We have previously explained that severing ties with one’s father and not upholding ties with him is haraam, no matter what the father may have done of bad treatment or falling short. So how about if the reason for that has to do with the child? Please see fatwa no. 87802. Our advice to you is to hasten to get back in touch with your father, treat him kindly, and apologise for your shortcomings and bad behaviour. Then you can tell him about this suitor, and if he wishes he may do the marriage contract himself, so long as he is still a Muslim, or if he wishes he can appoint a proxy to do the marriage contract. As for bypassing your father and appointing someone else as your guardian, whether he is the imam of the mosque or someone else, this is not permissible. In fact some of the scholars were of the view that if a woman’s marriage contract is done by a more distant guardian, such as her brother, when the closer guardian, such as her father, is still alive, the marriage contract is not valid. This has been explained previously in fatwa no. 135233 So it is more likely that the marriage contract done by a non-mahram when the guardian is still alive is not valid. With regard to what this young man is asking for of seeing you and meeting you before marriage, in principle this is something that is prescribed. This has been explained previously in fatwa no. 2572 But for you to go and let him see you on your own, this is not permissible, especially if that results in being alone together, because being alone with a woman is prohibited, as we have previously explained in fatwa no. 94019 Similarly, it is not permissible for you to go and meet him accompanied by a non-Muslim, because your interacting with a non-mahram non-Muslim is also not permissible, as it opens the door to a great deal of temptation and corruption. Our advice to you in this situation is to hasten, first of all, to get in touch with your father and tell him about this matter, and wait for his opinion. If he agrees with you meeting this young man, then that will be by your father’s arrangement and in his presence, or in his company. If that is not possible, then he may appoint one of your mahrams to take charge of the matter and be your chaperone. If that is not possible either, it is permissible for you to meet him in the company of some trustworthy Muslims, and we suggest that it should be the imam of the mosque, or one of those in charge of the Islamic centre in your neighbourhood, and the contact or meetings between you and this young man after that should be arranged through this imam or the people in charge of the Islamic centre, because direct contact with him is a means that may lead to evil or mischief. If the matter works out and the time comes for the marriage contract, then you should proceed along the lines explained above: either your father should come and do the marriage contract himself, or your father should appoint someone else to do the marriage contract for you in his stead, whether that proxy is one of your relatives or someone else. Finally, we should draw your attention to an important matter, which is that it is stipulated that this young man who has proposed marriage to you should be a Muslim and chaste, because it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry anyone but a chaste Muslim man, as we have explained previously in fatwas no. 85335 and 118098 More importantly, it is not permissible for her to marry a non-Muslim; this is haraam and is an invalid marriage, according to scholarly consensus. And Allah knows best."
283,The status of the imams of the Ithna ‘Ashari Shi’ah,"Question What is the position on the 12 Imams of the Shia, especiallt the later ones?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The Raafidis, Imamis or Ithna ‘Asharis (“Twelvers”) are one of the branches of Shi’ism. They are called Raafidis because they rejected (rafada) most of the Sahaabah and they rejected the leadership of the two Shaykhs Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, or because they rejected the imamate of Zayd ibn ‘Ali, and deserted him. They called Imamis because they are primarily focused on the issue of imamate, and they made it a basic principle of their religion, or because they claim that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that ‘Ali and his descendents would be imams. They are called Ithna ‘Asharis (“Twelvers”) because they believe in the imamate of twelve men from the Prophet’s family (ahl al-bayt), the first of whom was ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) and the last of whom was Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-‘Askari, the supposed hidden imam, who they say entered the tunnel of Samarra’ in the middle of the third century AH and he is still alive therein, and they are waiting for him to come out! They hold beliefs and principles which are contrary to those of the people of Islam, such as the following: -1- They exaggerate about their imams, claiming that they are infallible, and they devote many acts of worship to them such as supplication, seeking help, offering sacrifices and tawaaf (circumambulating their tombs). This is major shirk which Allaah tells us will not be forgiven. These acts of shirk are committed by their scholars and common folk alike, without anyone among them objecting to that. -2- They say that the Holy Qur’aan has been distorted, and that things have been added and taken away. They have books concerning that which are known to their scholars and many of their common folk, and they even say that believing that the Qur’aan has been distorted is an essential tenet of their beliefs. See the answer to question no. 21500. -3- They regard most of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) as kaafirs, and disavow them, and they seek to draw closer to Allaah by cursing and reviling them. They claim that they apostatized after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) except very few (only seven). This is a rejection of the Qur’aan which affirms their virtue, and says that Allaah was pleased with them and chose them to accompany His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It also implies a slur against the Qur’aan itself, because it was transmitted via them; if they were kuffaar then there is no guarantee that they did not distort it or change it. This is what the Raafidis believe anyway, as stated above. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: As for the one who goes further and claims that they apostatized after the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, apart from a small number, no more than ten or so, or that they became evildoers, there is no doubt that he is a kaafir, because he is rejecting what it says in the Qur’aan in more than one place, that Allaah was pleased with them and praised them. Indeed, the one who doubts that such a person is a kaafir is to be labelled as a kaafir himself, because what this view implies is that those who transmitted the Qur’aan and Sunnah were kuffaar or rebellious evildoers. The verse says “You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110], and the best of them were the first generation. But according to this view, most of them were kaafirs and rebellious evildoers, and this ummah is the worst of nations and the earliest generations of this ummah were the most evil of them. The fact that this is kufr is something that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing. End quote from al-Saarim al-Maslool ‘ala Shaatim al-Rasool (p. 590). -4- They attribute badaa’ to Allaah, i.e., forming a new opinion that was not held before. This implies attribution of ignorance to Allaah, may He be exalted. -5- They believe in taqiyah (dissimulation) which means showing outwardly something other than what one feels inside. In fact this is lying and hypocrisy and skill in deceiving people. This is not something that they do at times of fear; rather they regard use of taqiyah as a religious duty for minor and major matters, at times of fear and times of safety. Whatever of truth was narrated from one of their imams, such as praise for the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or agreeing with Ahl al-Sunnah, even in matters of purification or food and drink, is rejected by the Shi’ah who say that the Imam only said that by way of taqiyah. -6- Belief in raja’ah, which is the belief that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the members of his household (ahl al-bayt), ‘Ali, al-Hasan, al-Husayn and the other imams will return. At the same time, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan, Mu’aawiyah, Yazeed, Ibn Dhi’l-Jooshan and everyone who harmed Ahl al-bayt – according to their claims – will also return. All of these people will return – according to their beliefs – to this world once more before the Day of Resurrection, when the Mahdi reappears, as the enemy of Allaah Ibn Saba’ told them; they will return in order to be punished because they harmed Ahl al-Bayt and transgressed against them and denied them their rights, so they will be severely punished, then they will all die, then they will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection for the final recompense. This is what they believe. And there are other corrupt beliefs which one can find more details about in the following books, which explain how false they are: al-Khutoot al-‘Areedah by Muhibb al-Deen al-Khateeb (available in English, translated by Abu Bilal Mustafa al-Kanadi) Usool Madhhab al-Shi’ah al-Imamiyyah by Dr. Naasir al-Qafaari Firaq Mu’aasirah tantasib ila al-Islam by Dr. Ghaalib ibn ‘Ali ‘Awaaji (1/127-269) Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Muyassarah fi’l-Adyaan wa’l-Madhaahib wa’l-Ahzaab al-Mu’aasirah (1/51-57). See also the answer to question no. 1148 and 10272. The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: Is the Imam Shi’ah way part of Islam? Who made it up? Because they, i.e., the Shi’ah, attribute their madhhab to Sayyiduna ‘Ali (may Allaah ennoble his face). Answer: The Imami Shi’ah madhhab is a fabricated madhhab that has been introduced into Islam. We advise you to read the book al-Khutoot al-‘Areedah and Mukhtasar al-Tuhfah al-Ithna ‘Ashariyyah and Minhaaj al-Sunnah by Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah], which will explain a lot of their innovations. ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan. End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (2/377). Secondly: From the above it is clear that this madhahb is false and that it goes against the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, and that its beliefs will not be acceptable from anyone, either from their scholars or their common folk. As for the imams to whom they claim to belong, they are innocent of this lie and falsehood. There follow the names of these imams: 1-‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who was martyred in 40 AH. 2-Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) (3-50 AH) 3-Al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) (4-61 AH) 4-‘Ali Zayn al-‘Aabideen ibn al-Husayn (38-95 AH), whom they call al-Sajjaad 5-Muhammad ibn ‘Ali Zayn al-‘Aabideen (57-114 AH) whom they call al-Baaqir 6-Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Baaqir (83-148 AH) whom they call al-Saadiq 7-Moosa ibn Ja’far al-Saadiq (128-148 AH) whom they call al-Kaadim 8-‘Ali ibn Moosa al-Kaadim (148-203 AH) whom they call al-Rida (Reza) 9-Muhammad al-Jawaad ibn ‘Ali al-Rida’ (195-220 AH) whom they call al-Taqiy 10-‘Ali al-Haadi ibn Muhammad al-Jawaad (212-254 AH) whom they call al-Naqiy 11-al-Hasan al-‘Askari ibn ‘Ali al-Haadi (232-260) whom they call al-Zakiy 12-Muhammad al-Mahdi ibn al-Hasan al-‘Askari, whom they call al-Hujjah al-Qaa’im al-Muntazar. They claim that he entered a tunnel in Samarra’, but most researchers are of the view that he did not exist at all, and that he is a Shi’i myth. See: al-Mawsoo’ah al-Muyassarah (1/51). Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (1/177): As for what they believe about the tunnel of Samarra’, that is a myth which has no basis in reality and no proof or sound reports. End quote. Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) divided the Imams of the Ithna ‘Ashari Shi’ah into four categories: 1 – ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, al-Hasan and al-Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with them). They are noble Sahaabah and no one doubts their virtue and leadership, but many others shared with them the virtue of being companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and among the Sahaabah there are others who were more virtuous than them, based on saheeh evidence from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 2 – ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn, Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Baaqir, Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Saadiq and Moosa ibn Ja’far. They are among the trustworthy and reliable scholars. Manhaaj al-Sunnah (2/243, 244). 3 – ‘Ali ibn Moosa al-Rida, Muhammad ibn ‘Ali ibn Moosa al-Jawaad, ‘Ali ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-‘Askari, and al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Muhammad al-‘Askari. Concerning them, Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: They did not show a great deal of knowledge such that the ummah might benefit from them, nor did they have any authority by means of which they could help the ummah. Rather they were like any other Haashimis, they occupy a respected position, and they have sufficient knowledge of what which is needed by them and expected of people like them; it is a type is knowledge that is widely available to ordinary Muslims. But the type of knowledge that is exclusive to the scholars was not present in their case. Therefore, seekers of knowledge did not receive from them what they received from the other three. Had they had that which was useful to seekers of knowledge, they would have sought it from them, as seekers of knowledge are well aware of where to go for knowledge. Minhaaj al-Sunnah (6/387). 4 – Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-‘Askari al-Muntazar (the awaited one). He did not exist at all, as stated above. And Allaah knows best."
284,No special wedding cloth in Islam,Question We are from Fall River High School in California. We would like to know about the materials used in making Islamic bridal dresses as well as any religious significance they might have. Thank You,"Praise be to Allah.There isn't any special material in Islam for wedding cloths. Islamic Sharee'a( Ruling ) is merciful not to place such provisions. However, there are general guidelines like forbidding men from wearing items that are specific to women such natural silk or gold since both degrade manhood. Furthermore; women are forbidden to dress like men. All of this is based on the concern of the Islamic Sharee'a to distinguish between the two sexes since the removal of such distinction is primary causes for corruption and decadence."
285,"Prohibition of images and erecting statues, and the effect this has on ‘aqeedah","Question I am having difficulties explaining to a muslim that erecting a non-muslim statue is haram. His response was this woman was a heroine and fought the muslims to defend her land, and she is my ancester before islamization.. Can a muslim idolize a statue, or erect one in memory of a hero?, even if the hero and/or heroine was not a muslim?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly, it may be understood from your question that what is to be denounced is the fact that the statue is of a kaafir, and that if it was a statue of a Muslim it would be permissible to erect it. This is a mistake, because all statues of animate beings are equally haraam, regardless of whether they are made in the images of a Muslim or a kaafir. Indeed, making a statue of a kaafir is worse, because it combines two evils, that of making the statue and that of glorifying this kaafir. There follow details of the prohibition on the making of images and statues. I.The prohibition on statues is not just the matter of fiqh; it goes beyond that to the matter of ‘aqeedah, because Allaah is the Only One Who has the power of giving shape to His creation and creating them in the best image. Making images implies that one is trying to match the creation of Allaah. The matter also has to do with ‘aqeedah when these images are taken as idols which are worshipped instead of Allaah. Among the daleel (evidence) that image-making is the exclusive preserve of Allaah are the following: 1.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:6] “And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a human being); then We told the angels, ‘Prostrate yourselves to Adam’” [al-A’raaf 7:11] “He is Allaah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise” [al-Hashr 59:24] “O man! What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous? Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion. In whatever form He willed, He put you together.” [al-Infitaar 82:6-8] These aayaat clearly state the belief that creating and giving form to creation is the preserve of their Lord, Creator and Fashioner, so it is not permissiblefor anyone to encroach on that and to try to match the creation of Allaah. 2.It was reported from ‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen that Umm Habeebah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church which they had seen in Ethiopia, in which there were images. Theytold the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it, and he said: “Those people, if there was a righteous man among them and he died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put images in it. These will be the most evil of creation before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 417; Muslim, 528) Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: This hadeeth indicates that making images is haraam. (Fath al-Baari, 1/525). Al-Nawawi said: Ourcompanions and other scholars said: making images of animate beings is extremely haraam and is a major sin, because severe warnings have been issued against it in the ahaadeeth. Whether the image is made to be used in a disrespectful fashion or for other purposes, it is haraam to make it in all cases, because it implies that one is trying to match the creation of Allaah, whether the image is to appear on a garment, carpet, coin, vessel, wall or whatever. With regard to pictures of trees, camel saddles, and other pictures in which no animate beings appear, these are not haraam. This is the ruling on making images. (Sharh Muslim, 14/81). 3.Sa’eed ibn Abi’l-Hasan said: I was with Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) when a man came to him and said, O Abu ‘Abbaas, I am a man who lives by what his hands make, and I make these images. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: I will only tell you what I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say. I heard him say: “Whoever makes an image, Allaah will punish him until he breathes life into it, and he will never be able to do that.” The man became very upset and his face turned pale, so [Ibn ‘Abbaas] said to him, Woe to you! If you insist on making images, then make images of these trees and everything that does not have a soul. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2112; Muslim, 2110). 4.‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: The people who will be the most severely punished before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image makers. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5606; Muslim, 2109). 5.It was reported from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Those who make these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, Give life to that which you have created! (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5607; Muslim, 2108). 6.It was reported that Abu Hurayrah entered a house in Madeenah and saw somebody making images in it. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: [Allaah says:] Who does greater wrong than one who goes and creates something like My creation? Let them create a seed or a small ant! (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5609; Muslim, 2111). Al-Nawawi said: Concerning the words of Allaah. “Let them create a small ant or a seed or a grain of barley!” means, let them create a small ant which has a soul and moves by itself, like this small ant which was created by Allaah. Or let them createa grain of wheat or barley, i.e., let them create a grain which is eaten as food or which can be planted so it will grow and which has the characteristics of a grain of wheat or barley or other seeds which were created by Allaah. This is impossible, as stated above. (Sharh Muslim,14/90). None can bring forth living vegetation out of nothing except Allaah, may He be glorified. 7.Abu Juhayfah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the price of a dog and the price of blood, and he forbade tattooing and asking to be tattooed, and the consumption or paying of ribaa, and he cursed those who make images. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1980). II.Islam prescribes that idols should be destroyed and smashed, not made and repaired. Among the evidence for this is the following: 1.‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered Makkah [at the Conquest], there were three hundred and sixty idols around the Ka’bah. He started hitting them with his stick and saying, “Truth has come and Baatil (falsehood) has vanished. Surely, Baatil is ever bound to vanish” [al-Israa’ 17:81 – interpretation of the meaning]. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2346; Muslim, 1781). 2.Abu’l-Hiyaaj al-Asadi said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to me: Shall I not send you on the same basis as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any statue without destroying it, and do not leave any built-up grave without razing it to the ground. (According to one report: and do not leave any picture without erasing it). (narrated by Muslim, 969). Ibn al-Qayyim said: Tamaatheel is the plural of Timthaal (statue), which refers to a representative image. Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: The command is to destroy two types of images: images which represent the deceased person, and images which are placed on top of graves – because Shirk may come about from both types. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa, 17/462). (al-Fawaa’id, p. 196). III.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against bringing images into the house, and said that this is a sin and deprives a person of good. Among the evidence for that is the following: 1.Abu Talhah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or statues.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3053; Muslim, 2106). 2.‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that she bought a pillow on which there were images. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. She saw on his face that he was upset, and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I repent to Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What is my sin? The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: What is this pillow? She said, I bought it for you so that you could sit on it and recline on it. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: On the Day of Resurrection, the makers of these images will be punished and it will be said to them, Give life to that which you have created. And he said: The angels do not enter a house in which there are images. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1999; Muslim, 2107). IV.Making images is a way of falling into Shirk, because Shirk starts with the veneration of those who are depicted in the images, especially when people have little or no knowledge. The evidence for this is: Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The idols of the people of Nooh were known among the Arabs later on. Wadd belonged to (the tribe of) Kalb in Dawmat al-Jandal. Suwaa’ belonged to Hudhayl. Yaghooth belonged to Muraad, then to Bani Ghutayf in al-Jawf, near Sabaa’. Ya’ooq belonged to Hamadaan. Nasar belonged to Humayr of Aal Dhi’l-Kalaa’. These were names of righteous men from the people of Nooh. When they died, the Shaytaan inspired their people to set up idols in the places where they had used to sit, and to call those idols by their names. They did that but they did not worship them, but after those people died and knowledge had been forgotten, then they started to worship them. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4636). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The reason why al-Laat was worshipped was the veneration of the grave of a righteous man which was there. (Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 2/333). And he said: This problem – i.e., veneration – which is why Islam forbids (images), is the reason why so many of nations have fallen into committing Shirk to a greater or lesser degree. (al-Iqtidaa’, 2/334). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, describing how the Shaytaan plays with the Christians: He plays with them with regard to the images which they have in their churches and which they worship. You cannot find any church which is free of these images of Maryam (Mary), the Messiah, George, Peter and others of their saints and martyrs. Most of them bow to these images and pray to them instead of to Allaah. The Patriarch of Alexandria even wrote a letter to the ruler of Rome supporting the idea of bowing to these images: (he said) Allaah commanded Moosa to make images of cherubim in the Tabernacle; and when Sulayman the son of Dawood built the Temple, he made images of cherubim and put them inside the Temple. Then he said in his letter: this is like when a king sends a letter to one of his governors and the governor takes the letter and kisses it then touches it to his forehead [a sign of respect], and stands up to receive it. He does not do this to venerate the paper and ink, but to venerate the king. In the same way, when one bows to an image, it is to venerate the person represented by the image, not to venerate the paints and colours. This is exactly the same as the example given to justify idol worship. (Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 2/292). And he said: In most cases, the reason why nations fall into Shirk is because of images and graves.” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/458). V.The aayaat and ahaadeeth quoted above indicate that the prohibition of images is for two reasons: The first is: because it implies that one is trying to match the creation of Allaah. The second is: because it is an imitation of the kuffaar. The third is: because it is a means of veneration and falling into Shirk. From the above it is clear that it is forbidden to make statues, whether the statue is of a Muslim or a kaafir. Whoever does that is trying to match the creation of Allaah and thus deserves to be cursed. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound, and to guide us. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
286,There is no hadeeth which says that a wife’s permission is required before taking another wife,Question Is there a hadith that relates to a husband needing the permission of present wife to marry 2nd wife?,"Praise be to Allah.There is no hadeeth which states that, and it is not conditional for the husband to have his wife’s permission to take another wife. But it is in everyone’s interests for him to try to get her consent, because this will help to reduce problems in the marriage."
287,He wants to become Muslim but he works as a tattoo artist,"Question I am a tattoo artist who is interested in Islam and would like to take my shahada. While I am aware that tattooing is considered haram, this is my profession for the past 15 years and I dont know what else I could do to support my family. Can I become a Muslim and remain in my profession?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The greatest blessing that Allah can bestow upon His slave is to enable him to discover Islam and open his heart to believe in Him and to submit to Him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whomsoever Allâh wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islâm, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allâh puts the wrath on those who believe not” [al-An‘aam 6:125]. Shaykh al-Sa‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah says – explaining to His slaves the sign of a person being blessed and guided and the sign of a person being doomed and misguided: if his heart is open to Islam and is filled with the light of faith and certainty, and he feels at ease with that in himself and he loves good and does it willingly, and he enjoys it and does not find it burdensome, this is a sign that Allah has guided him and blessed him by enabling him to follow the straight path. And the sign of the one whom Allah wishes to leave astray is that he finds his heart constricted and he feels uneasy with ideas of faith, knowledge and certainty; his heart is immersed in specious arguments and whims and desires, and no goodness can reach him; his heart is not open to doing good. In his constriction it is as if he is climbing up to the sky, i.e., as if he has been made to climb up to the sky, which he is reluctant to do. This reason, the fact that they do not believe, is what dictated that Allah should put the wrath on them, because they closed the door of mercy and goodness for themselves. This is a rule that does not change. The one who gives (in charity) and fears Allah and testifies to the truth, Allah will show him the path of ease, but whoever is miserly and thinks he does not need any guidance and disbelieves in the truth, Allah will show him the path of evil. End quote from Tafseer al-Sa‘di, 272. We ask Allah to guide you and open your heart to Islam, and to bless you by enabling you to submit to Him and accept His religion. Secondly: Your entering Islam is something that is obligatory and there can be no delay or hesitation, because it is the way to eternal happiness and salvation from disbelief and eternity in Hellfire. So there is no room for choice in that regard, and you should not place any obstacle in the way, no matter what it is. Rather you should hasten to enter Islam straight away, and throw off the life of heedlessness and confusion. When you do ghusl (full ablution) and pray and prostrate before Allah, you will realise the difference between being a person who is a slave to Allah the Almighty Creator, and being a person who is a slave to his own self and his whims and desires. Perhaps you think now that you will never overcome the haraam deed that is tattooing, but we believe that when you become Muslim, you will gain an amazing strength by which you will attain victory over your nafs (self) and you will find your freedom and pleasure in obeying the command of your Lord and sacrificing worldly gains and pleasures to please Him. Entering into the new religion means that one is breaking free from constraint, constriction, humiliation and a life of hardship. It is freeing one’s soul to soar in a vast world which can hardly encompass his joy and happiness, and one will be prepared to sacrifice what is dear and precious in order to retain this happiness. Life is filled with dozens and hundreds of stories and cases in which people -- after becoming Muslim -- were able to overcome habits and attitudes that had been deeply rooted in their lives, such as zina (fornication, adultery) and drinking alcohol; giving up such things is much harder than giving up a job or profession. Islam instils in the hearts of its followers the certainty that Allah is the Sovereign, the Provider Who provides for His slave from sources they could not imagine, and He does not disappoint anyone who puts his hope in Him. “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). 3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]. These are not just words aimed at stirring up emotions; rather it is truth that one must believe in. Allah is the Creator and Sovereign of all things, and He has promised His slave that He will provide for him and suffice him and grant him happiness, if he fears Him and obeys Him. Allah never breaks His promise and what is beyond His power when He is Able to do all things? Do you think that Allah would grant you provision when you disbelieve in Him and are disobeying His commands, then when you believe in Him and make sacrifices for the sake of His religion, He would abandon and forsake you?? O slave of Allah: You must have heard of Makkah (Mecca), where our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was born, to which pilgrimage is performed to the sacred House of Allah, which is the fifth pillar of Islam (Hajj = pilgrimage). Have you heard of the well of Zamzam from which water springs in Makkah? Do you know the story behind this amazing water, which has continued flowing for thousands of years until today? It is an amazing story, which is like your story to a large extent. The Prophet of Allah Ibraaheem (Abraham -- peace be upon him), took his wife Haajar (Hagar), the mother of Ismaa‘eel (Ishmael -- peace be upon him) to settle her in the place that would become the location of Makkah (Mecca); it was an uninhabited place at that time, with no inhabitants, no water, no agriculture, nothing… … Then Ibraaheem brought Haajar and her son Ismaa’eel when she was still breastfeeding him, to a place near the Ka’bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he left them there and left with them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ismaa’eel’s mother followed him saying, “O Ibraaheem! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?” She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look at her. Then she asked him, “Has Allaah commanded you to do this?” He said, “Yes.” She said, “Then He will not forsake us,” and went back while Abraham proceeded onwards. When he reached al-Thaniyah where they could not see him, he turned to face the Ka’bah, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayer: “O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks” [Ibraaheem 14:37]. Ismaa’eel’s mother went on breastfeeding Ismaa’eel and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ismaa’eel) tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached al-Marwa where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safa and al-Marwa) seven times. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “This is the (origin of) the people’s saa’i (walking) between them between them (i.e. al-Safa and al-Marwa).” When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she said to herself “Shh!” and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, “O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?” Then she saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), until water appeared. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “May Allah have mercy on the mother of Ismaa’eel! Had she let Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.” And he said: “The angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people’…” The story was narrated at length in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3364. See how the mother of Ismaa‘eel (peace be upon him) had certain faith that Allah would not forsake them so long as Ibraaheem did what Allah commanded him to do. Look at the angel who came to her to bring forth water for her and her thirsty child from the depths of the earth; He said to her: Do not be afraid of being neglected … So do not be afraid of being neglected, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is too generous and kind for that and He is greater than you can ever imagine. This does not apply only to you; rather this is something that is repeated with thousands of Muslim people... They are afraid to repent and follow the path of righteousness because they are working in haraam jobs, in banks that deal in riba (usury), or in casinos, or in haraam types of entertainment, and so on. The Shaytaan makes them fear poverty and makes them think that there is no alternative way of earning a living, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Shaitân (Satan) threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit Fahshâ (evil deeds, illegal sexual intercourse, sins); whereas Allâh promises you Forgiveness from Himself and Bounty, and Allâh is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower” [al-Baqarah 2:268]. But reality demonstrates that most of those who repent find that opportunities to earn a halaal income open up for them that they could never imagine. Hence we say: hasten to become Muslim and free yourself from the shackles of disbelief; remove its darkness from your eyes and save yourself from the Fire. Do not fear poverty when you are under the protection of the Lord of the Worlds, the Sovereign Whose stores are never empty. And be certain that He will never forsake His slaves or abandon His people and close friends. Let us assume, for argument’s sake, that you do not find any halaal means of earning a living after you become Muslim, so you go back to your haraam job. What comparison can there be between your situation before and your situation after? It is a comparison between a believing Muslim who affirms the oneness of Allah but commits sin, and a person who disbelieves in Allah. There is no comparison between them at all. The wise man, if he chooses between two bad things or two evils, will choose the lesser of the two. So he will not choose a combination of disbelief and sin; rather he will choose Islam and guidance, and if he falls into sin after he disciplines himself in obedience to Allah, then in that case he will have the hope of forgiveness. However we say that this is only an assumption; we think that Allah will honour you, provide for you and bestow upon you from His bounty that which you cannot imagine, because He is the Most Generous, the Kind, the Most Merciful Who says (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)” [al-Nahl 16:97]. Finally, the best news you can give us is the news that you have become Muslim and a believer, and we are waiting for this wonderful news. O Allah, open his heart to faith and guide his heart to Islam, and bestow upon him the bounty of Your mercy. And Allah knows best."
288,Paying zakaah on behalf of workers,"Question We have a factory and a farm in which there are workers who are paid wages. Can we pay zakaat al-fitr on their behalf, or should they pay it for themselves?.","Praise be to Allah.The workers who are paid wages in return for their work in the factory and on the farm are the ones who should pay zakaat al-fitr for themselves, because the basic principle is that it is obligatory upon them. (So you do not have to pay it on their behalf). And Allaah is the Source of strength."
289,Virtues of Du’a on the Day of ‘Arafah,Question Will du’a offered on the day of ‘Arafah by those who are not on Hajj be answered?,"Praise be to Allah.Best Du`a on the Day of Arafah ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no day on which Allah ransoms more of His slaves from the Fire than the day of ‘Arafah . He draws close then He boasts about them before the angels and says, ‘What do these people want?’” (Narrated by Muslim, 1348) ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of du’a is du’a on the day of ‘Arafah, and the best that I and the Prophets before me said is ‘La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the dominion, to Him be praise, and He has power over all things).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3585)’ classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib (1536) Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd ibn Kurayz narrated in a mursal report: “The best of du’a is du’a on the day of ‘Arafah.” (Narrated by Malik in al-Muwatta’ (500); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’ (1102) Virtues of Du`a on the Day of Arafah: For Pilgrim Only? The scholars differed concerning this virtue of du’a on the day of ‘Arafah , whether it applies only to those who are in ‘Arafah or it includes other places. The more correct view is that it is general and that the virtue is connected to the day, but undoubtedly those who are in ‘Arafah have combined the virtue of the place with the virtue of the time. Al-Baji (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The words “The best of du’a is on the day of ‘Arafah ” mean the dhikr with the greatest blessing, the greatest reward and that which is most likely to be answered. It may be interpreted as referring to pilgrims only, because the meaning of du’a on the day of ‘Arafah is very true in their case, and applies especially to them. But if the day of ‘Arafah is regarded in general terms, it is described as such because of the pilgrims being there. And Allah knows best.” (Al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta, 1/358) It is proven that some of the salaf regarded “al-ta’rif” as permissible, which means gathering in the mosques to offer du’a and remember Allah (dhikr) on the day of ‘Arafah . Among those who did that was Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him). Imam Ahmad also regarded it as permissible although he did not do it himself. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Al-Qadi said: There is nothing wrong with ta’rif, gathering in the afternoon of the day of ‘Arafah in the regions (i.e., other than ‘Arafah). Al-Athram said: I asked Abu ‘Abd-Allah (i.e., Imam Ahmad) about ta’rif in the regions, where they gather in the mosques on the day of ‘Arafah, and he said: I hope that there is nothing wrong with it, as more than one did it. Al-Athram narrated that al-Hasan said: The first one who did ta’rif in Basra was Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah have mercy on him). Ahmad said: The first ones who did it were Ibn 'Abbas and ‘Amr ibn Hurayth. Al-Hasan, Bakr, Thabit and Muhammad ibn Wasi’ used to attend the mosque on the day of ‘Arafah. Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with it, it is only du’a and remembrance of Allah (dhikr). It was said to him: Do you do it? He said: As for me, no. And it was narrated that Yahya ibn Ma’in attended (the mosque) with the people on the afternoon of ‘Arafah.” (Al-Mughni, 2/129) This indicates that they thought that the virtue of the day of ‘Arafah did not apply only to the pilgrims, although gathering to remember Allah and say du’a in the mosques on the day of ‘Arafah was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Hence Imam Ahmad did not do it, but he allowed it and did not forbid it, because it was narrated that some of the Sahabah did it, such as Ibn 'Abbas and ‘Amr ibn Hurayth (may Allah be pleased with them). And Allah knows best."
290,Islamic Dress Code for Men,"Question In the Quran, it has clearly mentioned how women should be dressed in any country or environment whether in an Islamic country or a non-Islamic country. I want to know, how should men be dressed in any country or environment whether in an Islamic country or in a non-Islamic country?","Praise be to Allah.There follows a summary of the rulings on dress for men. We ask Allah to make it sufficient and beneficial. The basic principle concerning everything that is worn is that it is halal and permissible, except for that concerning which there is a text to state that it is haram, such as silk for males. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “These two [gold and silk] are forbidden for the males of my ummah and permissible for the females.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3640; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah) Similarly it is not permissible to wear the skin of a dead animal (one that has died of natural causes) unless it has been tanned. With regard to wearing clothes made of wool, goat hair and camel hair, these are pure and permissible. For more information on the use of the skin of dead animals after tanning, please see these answers: no. 1695 and 9022 . It is not permissible to wear thin or see-through clothing that does not conceal the ‘awrah. It is haram to imitate the polytheists and unbelievers in their manner of dress , so it is not permissible to wear clothing that is unique to the unbelievers. ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw ‘Ali wearing two garments dyed with safflower and said: “These are garments of the unbelievers; do not wear them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2077) It is haram for women to imitate men and men to imitate women in the way they dress. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the men who imitate women and the women who imitate men.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5546) It is Sunnah for a Muslim to start with the right when dressing, and to say, Bismillah (In the name of Allah), and to start with the left when taking clothes off. Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you get dressed and when you do wudu, start on the right.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4141; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 787) It is Sunnah for the one who is putting on a new garment to thank Allah and make du`a. Abu Sa’id said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put on a new garment, he would call it by its name, whether it was a turban, a shirt or a cloak, then he would say: “Allahumma laka al-hamd anta kasawtanihi asaluka khayrahu wa khayra ma suni’a lah wa a’udhu bika min sharrihi wa sharri ma suni’a lah (O Allah, to You be all praise. You have clothed me with it. I ask You for the good of it and the good for which it was made, and I seek refuge with You from the evil of it and the evil for which it was made).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1767; Abu Dawud, 4020; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4664) It is Sunnah to pay attention to keeping one's clothes clean, without feeling arrogant or exaggerating about that. ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one will enter Paradise in whose heart is a mustard-seed of arrogance.” A man said: “What if a man likes his clothes to look nice and his shoes to look nice?” He said: “Allah is Beautiful and loves beauty; arrogance means rejecting the truth and looking down on people.” (Narrated by Muslim, 91) It is mustahabb to wear white clothes Ibn 'Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Wear white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 994, hasan sahih. This is what the scholars regarded as mustahabb. Also narrated by Abu Dawud, 4061; Ibn Majah, 1472. ) It is haram for the Muslim man to let any garment he wears hang down beneath his ankles (an action known as isbal ); the limit for any garment is the ankles. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said; “Whatever of the lower garment is beneath the ankles is in the Fire.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5450) Abu Dharr narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three to whom Allah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection and will not look at them or praise them, and theirs will be a painful torment.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) repeated it three times. Abu Dharr said: “May they be doomed and lost; who are they, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “The one who lets his garment hang beneath his ankles, the one who reminds others of favours he has done, and the one who sells his product by means of false oaths.” (Narrated by Muslim, 106) It is haram to wear garments of fame and vanity, which means a garment that stands out from others so that people will look at the wearer and he will become known for it. Ibn ‘Umar said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wears a garment of fame and vanity, Allah will dress him in a garment like it on the Day of Resurrection.” According to another version, “…then set it ablaze.” And according to a third version, “will dress him in a garment of humiliation.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4029; Ibn Majah, 3606 and 3607; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib, 2089) The brother may also refer to the section on Dress in this website, where there is more information. And Allah knows best."
291,The uprising of the Palestinian people,"Question Today we are witnessing a major political phenomenon that has shaken the world, namely the uprising of the Palestinian people against the Jews (the Intifada). Can you suggest something that we can say to the Muslim people in occupied Palestine?","Praise be to Allah. I advise them to fear Allaah and to cooperate in doing good and in righteous deeds, for Allaah will support those who support His cause. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allaah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm” [Muhammad 47:7] And Allaah says elsewhere in His Holy Book: “Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islam). And He will surely, give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me” [al-Noor 24:55] I advise all of our brothers to cooperate with them and I advise the rich and those in positions of authority to extend the hand of aid to their brothers in Palestine who are striving to regain their land and achieve victory over the enemy, in sha Allaah. May Allaah support them with the truth and reward them with all good on behalf of the Muslims. All they have to do is to persevere in patience and constancy, and vie in such perseverance, for the promise of Allaah is true and Allaah will help those who help His cause. May Allaah help them and grant them victory over their enemies, and may He enable the Muslims to help them and stand firm with them until Allaah grants them victory over their enemy, for He is the best of supporters."
292,There is nothing wrong with leaving the mosque after the adhaan to go and pray in another mosque,Question It is clear in the sharee3ah that you are not allowed to leave a masjid before the salaat after the Athaan is called unless you have a valid excuse like needing to leave in order to complete you wuDoo. But is it allowed to leave after the athaan in one masjid in order to go to another masjid for the same prayer ? The other masajid may have a bigger jamaa3 or a better reciter as well as having people he wants to see after the salaat. In my case there is a small masjid that has a lesson after salaatul-maghrib up until `Ishaa time but there are other masajid that have bigger jama3s for `Ishaa some miles away in the same city and sometimes have better reciters and also have many other brothers I like seeing.,"Praise be to Allah.It is haraam to leave the mosque after the adhaan without an excuse, because Muslim (655) narrated that Abu’l-Sha’tha’ said: We were sitting in the mosque with Abu Hurayrah when the muezzin gave the adhaan. A man stood up and walked out of the mosque, and Abu Hurayrah followed him with his gaze until he exited the mosque. Abu Hurayrah said: This man has disobeyed Abu’l-Qaasim (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was also narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who commented: Based on this, according to the scholars among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and those who came after them, one should not leave the mosque after the adhaan, except for one who has an excuse, such as not having wudoo or something that cannot be avoided. End quote. Ahmad (10946) narrated it with the addition: Then he said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us: “If you are in the mosque and the call to prayer is given, none of you should leave until he prays.” Classed as saheeh by Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq al-Musnad. Excuses which make it permissible to go out include: going out to do wudoo’ if the place for doing wudoo’ is outside the mosque; going out with the intention of coming back, such as if a person goes out to wake up his family, for example, then come back. This applies to going out to pray in another mosque, if he knows that he will be able to catch up with the prayer there. It says in Ghaayat al-Muntaha: It is haraam to leave the mosque after the adhaan and before praying without an excuse or the intention of coming back. … And it is permissible to go out if one goes out after the adhaan but it is in order to pray with the congregation in another mosque, especially if its imam is better. End quote from al-Ghaayah ma’a Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha (1/304). Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa (2/104): The prohibition on going out of the mosque is subject to further discussion: if there is no need for it and it serves no valid purpose, then it is haraam to go out. That is because he looks like one who is going out of the mosque without praying. But if he intends to pray in another mosque, or he has an excuse or he intends to return and there is sufficient time, then it is not haraam. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on a man doing wudoo’ in one mosque then praying in another mosque? He replied: If the place for doing wudoo’ is outside the mosque, there is nothing wrong with him doing wudoo’ in this place and praying in another mosque, unless the iqaamah has already been given in this mosque, in which case it is better for him to pray there. If the place for doing wudoo’ is inside the mosque, then it is not permissible for him to leave the mosque after the adhaan unless it is for a reason, because Abu Hurayrah saw a man leave the mosque after the adhaan and he said: This man has disobeyed Abu’l-Qaasim (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But if there is a reason, such as if he wants to go to another mosque to attend a lesson or for some essential purpose, then there is nothing wrong with him leaving, even if the place for doing wudoo’ is inside the mosque. End quote. He was also asked: I see some brothers sitting in the mosque for a lesson, then when the adhaan begins, they leave. I have read that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade leaving the mosque when the adhaan is given. What is the ruling on that? He replied: In al-Saheeh it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he saw a man leave after the adhaan and he said: This man has disobeyed Abu’l-Qaasim (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The scholars said: It is haraam to leave the mosque after the adhaan without an excuse. But this hadeeth does not clearly state that the man went out to pray in another mosque. He may have gone out so as not to pray. What we think is that if you go out to pray in another mosque where you are sure that you will catch up with the prayer, there is nothing wrong with it, but that should not be done lest others follow that example and go out without praying. End quote from Liqa’ al-baab il-Maftooh (9/38). Hence you will know that it is permissible for you to go out of the mosque after the adhaan in order to pray in another mosque where the imam recites better or to meet some of your brothers there, if you know that when you go there you will be able to catch up with the congregation. And Allaah knows best."
293,Is it permissible for a woman to work selling products over the phone?,"Question There are foreign companies in Morocco which also own companies in the west. These companies that are in Morocco offer customer service for the companies that are in the west over the phone, whereby western customers contact the companies in Morocco to ask questions or the company contacts customers who are obviously in the west – Europe – to sell their products over the phone, and the employee attempts to convince the person to buy. The companies market various products and services such as mobile phones, internet, insurance, computers and so on. These companies have started to increase rapidly, and young men – and even young women – are clamouring to join them as they pay a good salary. The government is also helping with that. Please note that fitnah is widespread in these companies, such as uncovering of women. What is the ruling on working for them? Is it halaal or haraam?.","Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible for a man or a woman to work in places where women mix with men. The evils of mixing are many. It is one of the most effective ways used by the shaytaan to make the Muslim fall into sin and immorality. Hence Islam blocks the ways that may cause a Muslim to fall into anything haraam. We have discussed the prohibition on mixing in the answer to question no. 1200, where we mention incidents of female workers who have been exposed to annoyance and harassment. This confirms that the Islamic prohibition on mixing is what will protect a woman’s modesty and chastity, and it is what protects a man from allowing his gaze to wander, and protects him from bad consequences. There is no reason why a woman should not work if she is with other women like her, or she is alone and answers calls from customers or calls them to offer the company’s products, so long as she observes proper etiquette when speaking and does not speak in an alluring tone to men, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner” [al-Ahzaab 33:32] See also the answer to question no. 27304, which discusses the ruling on how to address women at work, and the answer to question no. 20140, which explains the ruling on a woman working as a secretary for men in the workplace. And Allaah knows best."
294,He wants to open a shop but he needs training where he will be forced to taste sweets containing alcohol and gelatine,"Question I live in Canada and I want to open a store for sweets. Before that I have to study patisserie (baking) where I will be forced to taste the sweets that we make when studying, and they contain gelatin and alcohol, but we do not have to swallow them. Please advise me, may Allaah bless you.","Praise be to Allah. With regard to alcohol, it is haraam to consume it, carry it, sell it or buy it. Ten categories have been cursed with regard to it, as it says in the hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1295) and Abu Dawood (3674) from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed ten with regard to alcohol: the one who squeezes it (the grapes etc), the one for whom it is squeezed, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, the one who consumes its price, the one who buys it and the one for whom it is bought.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. It is not permissible to put alcohol in the sweets or to taste these sweets, even if that is for the purpose of study or to get a certificate which will allow one to work, because that is not a case of necessity that makes it permissible to commit a haraam action. With regard to gelatin, some of it is halaal and some is haraam. This has been explained in the answer to question no. 210. Whatever is haraam, it is not permissible to put it in the sweets or to taste it. You should note that there are many halaal ways of earning a living, and that if a person gives up something for the sake of Allaah, He will compensate him with something better than it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). 3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3] The loser is the one who sells his religious commitment for some transient worldly gain, and he will not gain anything from this world except what is decreed for him. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Holy Spirit (Jibreel) has inspired to me that no soul will die until it has completed its appointed term and received its provision in full, so fear Allaah and do not be desperate in seeking provision, and no one of you should be temped to seek provision by means of committing sin if it is slow in coming to him, for that which is with Allaah can only be attained by obeying Him.” Narrated by Abu Na’eem in al-Hilyah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 2085. We ask Allaah to provide for you from His bounty and to make you independent of means by that which is halaal so that you have no need for that which is haraam. And Allaah knows best."
295,Is there any expiation for having intercourse with a woman in her back passage?,Question Is there any expiation for having intercourse with one’s wife in her back passage?.,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: It is haraam to have intercourse with one’s wife in her back passage, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the one who does that is cursed. We have quoted the evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah to show that it is haraam, as well as describing some of the evil consequences of that, in the answer to question no. 1103 and 6792. Islam has not stipulated any expiation for this action, so there is no expiation for it apart from repentance and regret, and turning back to Allaah. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on having intercourse with a woman in her back passage? Is there any expiation required of the one who does that? He replied: Having intercourse with a woman in her back passage is a major sin and is one of the most heinous acts of disobedience, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cursed is the one who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2162; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will not look at a man who had intercourse with a man or a woman in the back passage.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1166; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. What the one who has done that must do is hasten to repent sincerely, which means giving up the sin and abstaining from it out of respect for Allaah and out of fear of His punishment, regretting what he has done of that and sincerely resolving never to go back to it, as well as striving to do righteous deeds. Whoever repents sincerely, Allaah will accept his repentance and forgive his sins, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)” [Ta-Ha 20:82] “And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. 69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; 70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Furqaan 25:68-70] There is no expiation required of one who has anal intercourse, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, and his wife does not become haraam to him because of that, rather she remains his wife. But she does not have to obey him in this grave evil; rather she is obliged to refuse, and to demand a annulment of her marriage to him if he does not repent. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound from that. From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/256 Al-Bayhaqi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If he does that (i.e., has intercourse with her in the back passage), then he should be punished (i.e., the judge or ruler should mete out a punishment that will deter him and others like him), because he has committed a sin for which there is no stipulated hadd punishment or expiation. Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 5/190 So he clearly stated that it is a sin, but no expiation is required. See Ansa al-Mataalib, 4/162; Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 5/624 Secondly: Many people make the mistake of thinking that because there is no expiation stipulated for a particular sin that it is an insignificant matter and is a minor sin. This way of thinking is not correct. Rather if one were to say that Allaah has not stipulated any expiation for anal intercourse because it is too serious to be expiated by any expiation, that would not be farfetched. As Imam Maalik says concerning swearing a false oath (al-yameen al-ghamoos): it is too serious to be expiated by any expiation. Al-Taaj wa’l-Ikleel, 4/406; see also al-Mudawwanah, 1/577 And Allaah knows best."
296,How did Islamic fiqh develop?,Question how was the science of fiqh developed ?,"Praise be to Allah.During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the Muslims used to receive the rulings of Islam directly from him. The Qur’aan came down as a teacher, guide and mufti, as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: “Allaah directs (thus) about Al-Kalaalah (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs)…”[al-Nisa’ 4:176] And it came to explain matters concerning which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions were uncertain, as in the story of the woman who asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about her husband’s divorcing her by zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce in which the husband says to his wife, “You are to me as my mother’s back”), as a result of which the first verses of Soorat al-Mujaadilah were revealed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to send some of his companions to teach the new Muslims how to worship and to give them legal rulings (fatwa). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to allow them a certain amount of room in understanding the texts of sharee’ah, then he would approve of their interpretation or correct them. At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a number of the Sahaabah used to issue fatwas (legal rulings). Some of the scholars said that they numbered fourteen, but in fact there were more than that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the imaam (leader) and teacher of mankind and at that time people spoke proper Arabic so whatever variations in interpretation there were, were few and minor. So the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was counted as a great loss to the ummah, because they lost their leader, guide and perfect example. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “After the death of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar, ‘Let us go to Umm Ayman and visit her as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. When they came to her, she wept, and they said to her, ‘Why are you weeping? What is with Allaah is better for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ She said, ‘I am not weeping because I do not know that what is with Allaah is better for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); rather I am weeping because the revelation from heaven has come to an end.’ She moved them to tears and they started weeping with her.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2454). But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not die until after the religion had been completed. One of the characteristics of this religion, which was perfected during the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), was that it includes features which qualify it to remain and continue until the end of time. Therefore this religion and understanding of it remained after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it will abide until the Day of Resurrection. After the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the people followed his guidance and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs who followed him. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to judge amongst them and issue fatwas to them based on what he found in the Qur’aan and hadeeth. If he could not find an answer, he would go out and ask the Muslims, saying, “Such and such an issue has been referred to me, do you know whether the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed a judgement concerning such a matter?” Then perhaps a group of them would come to him, all of them saying that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had passed a judgement on it. Then Abu Bakr would say, “Praise be to Allaah Who has caused there to be among us those who memorized things from our Prophet.” And if he was unable to find any Sunnah narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he would gather the leaders of the people and the best among them and if they agreed on something he would pass judgement according to that. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) did the same after Abu Bakr had died. Then the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) dispersed to different regions as teachers and mujaahideen, after the expansion of the Islamic territory. Each of them used to issue fatwas in accordance with what he knew of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, or the actions of Abu Bakr or ‘Umar, or the conclusions to which his own ijtihaad led him. The muftis among the Sahaabah numbered more than one hundred, and those who issued many fatwas numbered seven, as Ibn al-Qayyim says. They were: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, ‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen, Zayd ibn Thaabit, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them all). ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) and his son, and Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with them), were in Madeenah, and many students became scholars at their hands, such as Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar, Naafi’ and others. Their knowledge was passed to the seven fuqaha’ and ultimately to Imaam Maalik ibn Anas al-Asbahi. Ibn Mas’ood and then ‘Ali were in Kufa, and a number of the Taabi’een learned from them, such as ‘Ilqimah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, Shurayh al-Qaadi, Silah ibn Zafar and many others besides them, until that knowledge reached Imaam Abu Haneefah al-Nu’maan ibn Thaabit. Fiqh and knowledge spread throughout the ummah from the companions of Ibn Mas’ood, the companions of Zayd ibn Thaabit, the companions of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar, and the companions of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas. That happened in Kufa, Madeenah and Makkah, respectively. These Taabi’een used to issue fatwas when the greatest Sahaabah were present, and they granted them permission to do that. For example, Ibn ‘Umar used to say of Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib: he is one of the muftis or one of those to be followed. And he said of him: if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had seen him, he would have been happy with him. Via these people, knowledge spread far and wide. Then the ahaadeeth were compiled in books and the numbers of students increased who occupied themselves with memorizing them and writing them down; then knowledge spread throughout the earth. Most of the people were religiously-committed and aware, and this prevented anyone from speaking without knowledge or claiming to be a scholar when he was not qualified to describe himself as such. Then differences because widespread and people became involved in the field of knowledge who would have been better off refraining from it. But by the wisdom of Allaah the religion was regulated and preserved by imams whom the ummah agreed that they were leaders and knowledgeable and that they had reached the utmost degree of knowledge of rulings and fatwas. Allaah caused them to become well known and their virtue spread throughout the world. Students flocked to them to learn and study, and their views were compiled in books. The opinions of the Sunni schools of thought which followed the truth of the Qur’aan and Sunnah and which rejected innovations in religion (bid’ah), according to what was transmitted by the students of the great imams, were recorded according to what was transmitted by the students of these great scholars, so the views of each imaam became a madhhab that is followed. The most famous of these madhhabs nowadays are just four: the Hanafi, Maaliki, Shaafa’i and Hanbali madhhabs. The followers of these madhhabs are agreed on most matters and on the most important issues of religion, and the differences in understanding and in the evidence that reached them have to do with minor issues. All of them are following something good, may Allaah have mercy on them. Then each of these madhhabs developed in ways which it would take too long to explain here, until things became as they are nowadays, where each madhhab has books containing its issues and methods of deriving rulings and interpreting evidence. And among the imams there are, praise be to Allaah, mujtahids who can produce rulings on contemporary events and issues by means of the understanding that Allaah has bestowed upon them, using ijtihaad, qiyaas (analogy), the principles of the objectives of sharee’ah, the sayings of previous scholars, and the principles of usool al-fiqh. Thus fiqh continued to be a rich discipline, comprehending all the issues of life which the Muslims need to know about. At all times there is someone who is showing the correct way, based on evidence, who recognizes the truth concerning a certain issue and he knows how to reach the correct conclusion. The scholars could not agree on something that is incorrect, hence the ummah cannot all follow falsehood. We ask Allaah to cause us to understand His religion and to bless us with knowledge and righteous deeds. And Allaah knows best. For more information see: Al-Fikr al-Saami fi Taareekh al-Fiqh al-Islaami and Taareekh al-Fiqh al-Islami by ‘Umar ibn Sulaymaan al-Ashqar. And Allaah knows best."
297,Women dyeing their hair for the purpose of beautification,Question Is it permissible for a woman to add colours to her hair unnecessarily for the purpose of beautification?.,"Praise be to Allah. The basic principle concerning things other than acts of worship is that they are permissible. Based on this it is permissible for a woman to dye her hair if she wishes, unless it is black dye that is used to conceal grey hairs, which is not permitted because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined changing grey hair but he said “avoid black”; or if this dye is something that is used only by kaafir women such that if this woman was seen, people would say that she is a kaafir woman, because no one uses this dye except kaafir women. In that case, it is haraam for a woman to dye her hair with it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” If the dye is free from these two elements, i.e., black to cover grey hairs and dye that is used only by kaafir women, then the basic principle is that it is permissible, so the woman may dye her hair if she wishes. End quote. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)."
298,Naming animals or giving animals special names that are different from what they are usually called,Question Is it permissible to name animals?.,"Praise be to Allah. There is nothing wrong with giving animals appropriate names. Al-Bukhaari (2872) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a she-camel called al-‘Adba’, that was never beaten in a race. Al-Bukhaari (2627) and Muslim (2307) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: There was a disturbance in Madeenah, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) borrowed a horse belonging to Abu Talhah that was called al-Mandoob, and rode it. He said: “We have not seen any cause for panic, and we have found it (the horse) to be swift-footed.” Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This shows that it is permissible to name animals; it was the custom of the Arabs to give animals and weapons names by which they would be known if they were to look for them, apart from ordinary names (nouns). End quote from Sharh as-Sunnah, 8/222 al-Bukhaari gave this chapter the title: Chapter on Naming Horses and Donkeys. Then he narrated a number of hadeeths concerning that, such as the hadeeth which says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had a horse that was called al-Laheef (2855), and he had a donkey that was called ‘Ufayr (2865). Al-Muhallab said: The fiqh concerning this matter is that it is permissible to give names to animals other than what they are usually called. End quote from Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 5/60 Abu’d-Darda’ had a camel called Damoon. Narrated by Ibn al-Mubaarak in az-Zuhd, 1173 Abu Qataadah had a horse called al-Jaraadah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2854 Al-Manaawi said, after mentioning some of the reports that were narrated concerning this matter: This shows that it is acceptable in sharee‘ah to give names to horses, mules, donkeys and other animals by which they may be told apart from others. End quote from Fayd al-Qadeer, 5/220 See: Zaad al-Ma‘aad, 1/132-134; al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/338 And Allah knows best."
299,Is it permissible to work in a mint?,"Question We know that working in a bank is haraam, but what is the ruling on working in the mint which prints the money for the banks – is that haraam too?.","Praise be to Allah. There is nothing wrong with working in the mint, and this work has nothing to do with the transactions of the riba-based banks. The people’s need for this currency is obvious to everyone, as it has become essential to their lives. Production of this currency is connected to the strength or weakness of the local economy, and the relationship between the mint and the central bank is not one of transactions, rather it issues orders to print a certain amount according to the fluctuations in the foreign currency reserve and the economy. And Allaah knows best."
300,Is it essential when doing ghusl for janaabah to wash with soap?,"Question If a person becomes junub then does ghusl, does he have to scrub his body with cleansing materials such as soap or not?.","Praise be to Allah. What is required when doing ghusl in the case of major impurity is to make the water reach every part of the body. It is not stipulated that soap or any other cleansing material be used, because none of those who described the ghusl of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in the case of janaabah said anything about him using lotus leaves or any other kind of cleansing material. Rather all he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did was to pour water over his body and make it reach every part. For example, ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when he did ghusl in the case of janaabah, used to pour three scoops of water with his hands, then pour water over all of his skin. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 240 It was narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I said: O Messenger of Allaah, I am a woman with tightly braided hair; should I undo it for ghusl from janaabah? He said: “No; it is sufficient for you to pour three handfuls of water over your head, then pour water over you, and you will become pure.” Narrated by Muslim, 330. The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked (5/315): Should one wash with soap after janaabah, and why? They replied: It is obligatory to do ghusl for janaabah using water, but it is not essential to use cleansing materials such as soap and the like. This is what is indicated by the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). But if one uses soap or some other cleansing material, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote. And Allah knows best."
301,"What is the meaning of the Prophet’s words, “I can see you behind my back”?","Question Hadith from Sahih Bukhari Narrated Abu Huraira: Allahs Apostle said, ""Do you consider or see that my face is towards the Qibla? By Allah, neither your submissiveness nor your bowing is hidden from me, surely I see you from my back."" Does this mean that Prophet could have seen at things behind him as well? Please clarify.","Praise be to Allah. One of the miracles of which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told his Companions is that he could see them behind his back, as he could see them in front of him. Al-Bukhaari (741) and Muslim (424) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you think that I face the qiblah (and do not know what you are doing)? By Allah, your bowing and prostrating are not hidden from me; I can see you behind my back.” Ahmad (9504) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led us in praying Zuhr, and in the last row there was a man who prayed badly. When he said the salaam, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) called him and said: “O So and so, do you not fear Allah? Do you not see how you pray. You think that you could hide from me some of what you do, but by Allah I can see behind me as well as I can see in front of me.” Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh (no. 811) The word seeing mentioned in the hadeeths is to be understood as it appears to mean, i.e., that he could see them visually. This is indicated by the report narrated by Muslim (423) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) prayed one day, then he finished and said: “O So and so, why don’t you pray well? Why doesn’t the worshipper look at how he is praying when he prays? He is only praying for himself. By Allah, I can see behind me as well as I can see in front of me.” An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadeeth: The scholars said: What this means is that Allah, may He be exalted, created for the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the ability in the back of his head to see what was behind him, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was granted more extraordinary abilities than this. This is not contrary to reason or textual evidence; rather the texts confirm this, so we must believe in it. Al-Qaadi said: Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him) and the majority of the scholars said that this seeing was in a literal and real sense. End quote from Sharh Muslim by an-Nawawi (4/149) Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There was a difference of scholarly opinion as to the meaning of this. It was said that what was meant is knowledge, either by means of Revelation so that he knew thereby how people really performed the prayer, or by means of inspiration. But this is subject to further discussion, because if what is meant is mere knowledge, he would not have specified by saying “behind my back.” And it was suggested that what is meant is that he could see whoever was on his right and on his left, of those on whom his gaze fell if he turned slightly sometimes, and he described those who were standing there as being behind his back. But this appears to be stretching the meaning and it is turning away from the apparent meaning when there is no need to do so. The correct view is that it is to be interpreted as it appears to mean, and that this “seeing” was in a real and literal sense that was unique to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and was an extraordinary feat. Based on that, the author narrated this hadeeth under the heading of the signs of Prophethood; it was also narrated under a similar heading from Imam Ahmad and others. End quote from Fath al-Baari by Ibn Hajar (1/514) Does this miracle include times of prayer and other situations? The text refers to prayer; as for other situations, there is no text that speaks of them. According to some scholars that is possible, but according to others it applied only to the case of prayer. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that this was something limited to the case of prayer, but it may be that this happened in all situations. That was also narrated from Mujaahid. End quote from Fath al-Baari by Ibn Hajar (1/515) Mullah ‘Ali al-Qaari said: The words “I can see you behind my back” do not necessarily mean that this occurred all the time, because it is contrary to the report which says “I do not know what is behind my wall.” Hence this was unique to the case of prayer and his knowledge about the worshippers behind him. And Allah knows best. End quote from Mirqaat al-Mafaateeh Sharh Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh (4/197) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He could see them behind his back, and this is something that was unique to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): in this particular situation (i.e., prayer) he could see the people behind his back. But in other situations, he could not see anything behind his back. End quote from Sharh Riyaadh as-Saaliheen (5/113) And Allah knows best."
302,Should he have intercourse with his menstruating wife and pay the expiation because her menstrual cycle is so long?,"Question My period lasts ten days, and then I find yellowish discharge for another five days. This offends my husband a lot as he cannot tolerate this. Is he allowed to have an intercourse with me before then ten day ends then pay expiation? Especially that I have only 16 days between the two periods.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: If the yellowish discharge comes straight after the menses then it is part of the menses, and it is not permissible at that time to have intercourse or to pray or fast. If the yellowish discharge comes after the end of the menses (tuhr), then it is not counted as anything. As for the yellowish discharge that comes directly before the menses, if it is accompanied by the pains of menses (cramps) that happen to women, then it is menses; if it is not accompanied by pains, then it is not menses. See the answer to question no. 37840. The end of menses (tuhr) occurs when one of two signs appear: the emission of a white discharge, or when the place becomes dry, so that if a piece of cotton etc is inserted it comes out clean with no trace of blood or yellowish or brownish discharge. Secondly: It is not permissible for the husband to have intercourse with his wife during her menses, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allaah has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina). Truly, Allaah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves (by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts and bodies for their prayers)” [al-Baqarah 2:222]. So it is not permissible to have intercourse with a menstruating woman until she becomes pure (her menses ends) and she has done ghusl. There is a stern warning against having intercourse with a menstruating woman, as was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (135), Abu Dawood (3904) and Ibn Majaah (639) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her back passage, or who goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he says, has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. The husband may enjoy his menstruating wife in ways other than intercourse. See question no. 36722. The wife does not have the right to agree to this evil, rather she must refuse. The husband must fear Allaah and beware of haraam forms of intimacy. In that which is halaal there is sufficient. In addition to being haraam, having intercourse during menses is harmful to both the man and the woman. See question no. 43028. And Allaah knows best."
303,Types of deposits in banks and the rulings thereon,"Question What is the ruling on making a deposit in an Islamic bank, such as the Faisal Islamic Bank?","Praise be to Allah.A deposit (wadee‘ah) is something that is left with someone else for safekeeping, without the other person having the authority to dispose of it. This is applicable to the safety deposit boxes that may be found in hotels and elsewhere, and also in some banks. With regard to bank deposits, that is something different, because the bank does not keep the exact money [that you deposit]; rather the bank disposes of it. This is as far as names are concerned. With regard to the rulings, bank deposits are of two types: The first type is a non-investment deposit, which is also called a demand deposit account or a current account. How it works is that the customer deposits his money in the bank on the basis that he can withdraw it whenever he wants, without making any profit or gain from the process. There is nothing wrong with this idea, because in a way it is a loan from the customer to the bank. But if the bank is riba-based, it is not permissible to deposit money in it, because the bank will benefit from this money and use it to support it in its haram activities. However, if the customer needs to put his money in the bank for safekeeping, and there is no Islamic bank where he can put his money to keep it safe, then in that case there is nothing wrong with him putting his money in a riba-based bank. Please see the answer to question no. 22392. The second type is investment deposits, in which the customer puts his money in the bank in return for profits or dividends to be paid at set intervals, as agreed. This type of deposit may take several forms, some of which are permissible and some are prohibited. One of the permissible forms is where there is a profit-sharing (mudaarabah) contract between the customer and the bank. In this case, the bank invests the money in permissible projects, in return for a set share of the returns. There are several conditions that are to be met in this case: 1. The bank should invest the money in permissible enterprises, such as establishing beneficial projects, building houses, and the like. It is not permissible to invest the money in building riba-based banks or cinemas, or lending with interest to the needy. Based on that, it is essential to know the nature of the investment that the bank will make. 2. There should be no guarantee of the capital. So the bank should not commit to return the capital if the bank incurs loss, so long as there has been no shortcoming on the bank’s part that resulted in the loss. That is because, if the capital is guaranteed, then this in reality is a loan contract, and any profit that it brings is regarded as riba (usury). 3. The profit should be defined and agreed upon from the outset, but it should be defined as a percentage of the profit, not of the capital. So one of the two parties should get, for example, one third or one half or 20% of the profits, with the remainder going to the other party. The contract is not valid if the percentages of the profit are not known or defined. The fuqaha’ stated that profit-sharing (mudaarabah) is rendered invalid if the shares of profits are unknown. haram forms of investment include the following: 1. If the capital is guaranteed, so the customer deposits 100, for example, in order to get interest of 10, along with a guarantee of the one hundred. This is a riba-based loan, and it is the regular practice in most banks. It may be called a deposit, or investment certificates or a savings account, and the returns may be shared periodically, or by drawing lots, as in the case of Class C investment certificates. All of that is haram. This has been explained previously in the answers to questions no. 98152 and 97896. 2. If the bank invests the money in haram projects, such as building cinemas and tourist results, in which evils are widespread and many sins are committed, it is haram to invest in this bank in that case, because this comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression. This is a brief overview of different types of deposits in banks. In a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation, formally the Organization of the Islamic Conference) it says the following: Firstly: Deposits that may be withdrawn at any time (demand deposit account or current account), whether they are in Islamic banks or riba-based banks, constitute loans according to the fiqhi point of view, as the bank which receives these deposits is entrusted with them (and liable for them), and are required according to sharee‘ah to return the money on request. The fact that it is a loan is not altered by the fact that the bank is wealthy. Secondly: bank deposits may be divided into two types, according to the regular practices of the bank: Deposits on which interest is paid, as is the case in riba-based banks. These are haram riba-based loans, regardless of whether the type of deposit is a demand deposit account (current account), or a deposit that is made for a set period, or a deposit for which notice must be given for withdrawal, or a savings account. Deposits given to banks that are committed to operating in accordance with the rulings of Islamic sharee‘ah on the basis of an investment contract, in return for a share of the profit; these deposits are regarded as capital for profit-sharing (mudaarabah) contracts, and are subject to the rulings on profit-sharing (mudaarabah) contracts according to Islamic fiqh. These rulings include the impermissibility of the bank guaranteeing the capital (or being liable for it). End quote from Majallat Majma‘ al-Fiqh, issue no. 9, part i, p. 931. If the Faisal Bank adheres to these guidelines, namely investing the money in permissible projects and not guaranteeing the customer’s capital, and agreeing with the customer on a defined share of the profits, then there is nothing wrong with making investment deposits in this bank, and there is also nothing wrong with opening a current account with it. And Allah knows best."
304,Method of Marriage Proposal in Islam,"Question What is the Sunnah with regard to proposing marriage? I mean if a young man wants to get married, should he send someone to the woman’s family to ask for her hand in marriage from her family? If his proposal is accepted and the woman and her family agree, what is the next step before the khitbah, such as the mahr (dowry) and other things that are required of the man? Is it Sunnah to recite al-Fatihah when the dowry is stipulated? Is it Sunnah to give the woman a ring on the day of the engagement and on the day of the wedding or is there any special kind of clothing?","Praise be to Allah.How to propose in Islam If a man wants to get married, and he has decided to propose to a particular woman, then he may go to her guardian on his own , or with one of his relatives such as his father or brother, or he may delegate someone else to propose marriage on his behalf. The matter is broad in scope, and prevalent customs should be followed. In some countries it is regarded as improper for the suitor to go on his own, so attention should be paid to that. Can you see your prospective wife in Islam? What is prescribed in Shari`ah is for the suitor to see the woman to whom he wants to propose marriage , because of the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1087), al-Nasa’i (3235) and Ibn Majah (1865) from al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah (may Allah be pleased with him), who proposed to a woman and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Go and look at her , for that is more likely to create love between you,” i.e., that is more likely to establish lasting love between you. This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. Determining the mahr and wedding expenses and wedding date If the girl and her family agree, then a mahr has to be agreed upon, and the wedding expenses and the wedding date, and so on. This also varies according to local customs, and what the man can afford and what preparations he has made for getting married. Some people do the proposal and the marriage contract in one sitting, and some delay the marriage contract after the engagement, and some delay the consummation after the marriage contract. All of that is permissible. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did the marriage contract with ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) when she was six years old then he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5158) Is it sunnah to recite al-Fatihah at the time of engagement? It is not sunnah to recite al-Fatihah at the time of engagement or at the time of the marriage contract. Rather the Sunnah is to recite Khutbat al-Hajah. `Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us Khutbat al-Hajah, (to be said) at weddings and on other occasions: “Inna al-hamda Lillahi nasta’inahu wa nastaghfiruhu, wa na’udhu bihi min shururi anfusina wa sayi’ati a’malina. Man yahdih Illahu fala mudilla lahu wa man yudlil fala hadiya lahu. Wa ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (Verily, all praise is to Allah, we seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Him from the evil of our own souls and from our bad deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides will never be led astray, and whomsoever Allah leaves astray, no one can guide. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger). ‘Ya ayyuha’n-nas uttaqu rabbakum alladhi khalaqakum min nafsin wahidatin wa khalaqa minha zawjaha wa baththa minhuma rijalan kathiran wa nisa’an wa’ttaqu-Llah alladhi tasa’aluna bihi wa’l-arhama inna Allaha kana ‘alaykum raqiban (O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship) Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you).’ [al-Nisa’ 4:1] ‘Ya ayyuha’lladhina amanu-ttaqu’Llaha haqqa tuqatihi wa la tamutunna illa wa antum muslimun (O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allah.)’ [Al ‘Imran 3:102] ‘Ya ayyahu’lladhina amanu-ttaqu’Llaha wa qulu qawlan sadidan yuslih lakum a’malakum wa yaghfir lakum dhunubakum wa man yuti’ Allaha wa rasulahu fa qad faza fawzan 'aziman (O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth). He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great achievement (i.e. he will be saved from the Hell-fire and will be admitted to Paradise)’ [al-Ahzab 33:70, 71].” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (2118) and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked (19/146): Is reciting al-Fatihah when a man gets engaged to a woman an innovation (bid’ah)? They replied: “Reciting al-Fatihah when a man gets engaged to a woman or when the marriage contract is done is an innovation (bid’ah).” Should you wear special clothing for an engagement or wedding? There is no special clothing to be worn for the engagement, wedding or consummation, for either the man or the woman. Attention should be paid to what the people are accustomed to with regard to that, so long as it is not contrary to Shari`ah. Based on that, there is nothing wrong with the man wearing a suit and so on. But if the woman is in a place where men can see her, she should wear concealing clothes, just as she should before and after the wedding. But if she is among women, she can adorn herself and wear whatever kind of clothes she wants, but she should avoid extravagance and waste and that which calls to fitnah. Are wedding rings permissible? As for wearing a ring , it is not prescribed for men or for women, because that involves imitating the disbelievers. May Allah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allah knows best."
305,What is the ruling on working in clothing design and fashion design?,Question What is the ruling of Islamic sharee‘ah on working as a fashion designer? I would like to know the aspects of halaal and haraam c oncerning that.,"Praise be to Allah. Designing clothes, or manufacturing and sewing them, and selling them, come under the same rulings as the clothes themselves. Whatever it is permissible to wear, it is permissible to design it, manufacture it and sew it. Whatever it is not permissible to wear, it is not permissible to design it, manufacture it or deal in it. What appears to be the case is that clothing may be divided into three categories: 1. Clothes that are permissible in all cases This refers to clothing that is usually used in a permissible manner, such as ordinary clothing for men and children, and women’s clothing that covers the body properly, or that is usually worn by women in front of other women, or that a woman wears at home. There is nothing wrong with designing, sewing, manufacturing and selling these kinds of clothes. 2. Prohibited clothing This refers to clothing for men that is made of silk, or women’s clothes that are not covering and that are usually worn on public occasions or in front of other people, or that it is thought most likely that women will use in prohibited ways. With regard to these kind of clothes, it is not permissible to design them, sew them, or manufacture them, because that comes under the heading of helping in that which is haraam. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to every kind of clothing that it is thought most likely will be used for sinful purposes, it is not permissible to sell it or sew it for someone who will use it for sinful and wrongful purposes. End quote from Sharh al-‘Umdah (4/386) It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (13/109): everything that is used for prohibited purposes, or it is thought most likely that it will be used in such ways, it is prohibited to manufacture it, import it, sell it, or distribute it among the Muslims. That includes what many women do nowadays – may Allah guide them – of wearing translucent, tight and short clothes, all of which results in showing their charms and adornment, and shows the shape of the woman’s limbs in front of non-mahram men. End quote. 3. Clothes that may be used for both permissible and prohibited purposes in equal measure, depending on the choice of the person who wears them A woman might wear them for her husband, or in front of women or mahrams, or she might wear them in front of non-mahrams. The basic principle concerning such clothes is that it is permissible to manufacture them, because they may be used in some permissible ways, and the burden of sin will be borne by those who use them in prohibited ways. And Allah knows best."
306,Refutation of the Church’s quoting the Qur’aan to prove that ‘Eesa is the “son of God”,"Question I read that the Church quotes some verses of the Qur’aan to prove that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) is the “son of God.” Their evidence is that when Allaah was alone He said, “Verily, I am Allaah! Laa ilaaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I)” [Ta-Ha 20:14 – interpretation of the meaning], in the singular; but when He created ‘Eesa the style used in some verses changed to the plural, as in the verses (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan)” [al-Hijr 15:9] and “And certainly We! We it is Who give life, and cause death” [al-Hijr 15:23]. And they say, God is speaking in the plural, i.e., in the sense of “God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit”.","Praise be to Allah. The variation in style in the Qur’aan, and the fact that Allaah sometimes speaks of Himself in the singular and sometimes in a plural form used by way of respect, does not prove that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) is the son of God, or that he is divine. This is for a number of reasons: -1- The variation in styles used in the Qur’aan, both singular and plural, occurs with reference to events that took place thousands of years before the creation of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and his mother Maryam (Mary), and when they were created and after that. Their existence has no effect on the variation in styles, rather that is due to another reason which may be explained as follows: Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire” [al-Hijr 15:26] “And (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.’ So they prostrated themselves except Iblees (Satan). He was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the Command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblees) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you?” [al-Kahf 18:50] The style used (singular vs. plural) varied before ‘Eesa and his mother (peace be upon them both) existed. Allaah said: “Verily, We did send down the Tawraat (Torah) [to Moosa (Moses)], therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allaah’s Will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests [too judged for the Jews by the Tawraat (Torah) after those Prophets], for to them was entrusted the protection of Allaah’s Book, and they were witnesses thereto. Therefore fear not men but fear Me (O Jews) and sell not My Verses for a miserable price. And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers — of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allaah’s Laws). And We ordained therein for them: Life for life… And in their footsteps, We sent ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), confirming the Tawraat (Torah) that had come before him, and We gave him the Injeel (Gospel)… And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)” [al-Maa'idah 5:44-48] “Verily, We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people” [Nooh 71:1] And Allaah said concerning His Khaleel (Close Friend) Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): “So when he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allaah, We gave him Ishaaq (Isaac) and Ya’qoob (Jacob), and each one of them We made a Prophet. And We gave them of Our Mercy (a good provision in plenty), and We granted them honour on the tongues (of all the nations, i.e. everybody remembers them with a good praise)” [Maryam 19:49-50] And He said concerning Moosa (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): “and made him draw near to Us for a talk with him [Moosa (Moses)]. And We granted him his brother Haaroon (Aaron), (also) a Prophet, out of Our Mercy” [Maryam 19:52-53] And He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad) as We sent the Revelation to Nooh (Noah) and the Prophets after him…” [al-Nisa’ 4:163] “And she who guarded her chastity [Virgin Maryam (Mary)], We breathed into (the sleeves of) her (shirt or garment) [through Our Rooh — Jibreel (Gabriel)], and We made her and her son [‘Eesa (Jesus)] a sign for Al-‘Aalameen (the mankind and jinn)” [al-Anbiya’ 21:91] “(Remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of Resurrection). O ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Remember My Favour to you and to your mother” [al-Maa'idah 5:110] And there are many other verses in which the style varies between singular and plural, where the verses speak of the creation of ‘Eesa, or Allaah’s words to him, and before he was created. From this it is clear that the style did not change after the creation of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) as a sign that he is the “son of God” or that he is “divine”, rather it is for another reason as we shall see below. -2- Everyone who knows the Arabic language and its styles will know that the pronoun Ana (I) and the first person is used in the singular when speaking of oneself. The first person plural Nahnu (we) is used to refer to two or more. But it may be used by an individual of high standing as a sign of his greatness, and the context and circumstances help the reader or listener to understand what is meant. Whoever disagrees with that is either ignorant and does not know what he is talking about or he is stubborn and wants to twist the meaning of the words, following his whims and desires. But Allaah will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the sinners hate that [cf. Yoonus 10:82]. This will be explained further below. -3- The Qur’aan is a Book the Verses whereof are perfected (in every sphere of knowledge), and then explained in detail from One (Allaah), Who is All-Wise Well-Acquainted (with all things) [cf. Hood 11:1] and Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All‑Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allaah) [cf. Fussilat 41:42]. Parts of it explain and confirm other parts. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And they say: ‘The Most Gracious (Allaah) has begotten a son (or offspring or children) [as the Jews say: ‘Uzayr (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say that He has begotten a son [‘Eesa (Jesus)], and the pagan Arabs say that He has begotten daughters (angels and others)].’ Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, That they ascribe a son (or offspring or children) to the Most Gracious (Allaah). But it is not suitable for (the Majesty of) the Most Gracious (Allaah) that He should beget a son (or offspring or children). There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allaah) as a slave” [Maryam 19:88-93] “Say (O Muhammad): He is Allaah, (the) One. Allaah‑us‑Samad [Allaah — the Self‑Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none co‑equal or comparable unto Him” [al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4] “Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:59] So whoever believes in Him must study the verses of the Qur’aan in the light of one another, not in isolation, the one who quotes from Qur’aan should be fair in his quotation. He should not quote verses and turn away from others, and he should not confuse truth with falsehood or use some verses against others in order to promote falsehood, as our predecessors the Jews did with the Torah, for which Allaah denounced them when He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Then do you believe in a part of the Scripture and reject the rest? Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the most grievous torment. And Allaah is not unaware of what you do” [al-Baqarah 2:85] Based on this, those who quote the Qur’aan as evidence should accept its evidence that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) is not the “son of God” and that he is not divine along with God, and they should affirm the Oneness of God, because of what is mentioned in its verses, and because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Surely, they have disbelieved who say: ‘Allaah is the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary).’ But the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)] said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers. Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)’” [al-Maa'idah 5:17] And there are many similar verses in the Qur’aan. Otherwise they should stop playing with the words, because that will only lead them to shame and will make the wise laugh at them in derision."
307,A Muslim girl is in love with a Hindu boy but wants to forget him,"Question Since seven years i am in love with one boy.... he is against my religion he is a hindu after a great effort i convinced him to convert to muslim and he had agreed but now he has changed his mind and he abuses me all the time and he ignores me because he income is good now i guess i am suppose to leave him but iam not able to do so because i love him a lot and i fear leaving him,he has taken care of me from four years now because i stay alone here for education and my parents are else where... please suggest a strong dua so that i succeed in my career and to totally forget this guy who keeps hurting and ignoring.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: You must hasten to repent to Allaah and beg Him to forgive and pardon you, for you have wronged yourself and your religion, and spent this long period of your life in disobedience to Allaah, and the shaytaan has made your bad deeds appear attractive to you. You say that you wanted to call this playboy to Islam, but you should have called yourself to fear Allaah and to beware of His punishment. It is indeed a great calamity when fathers and mothers fail to protect their daughters and leave them exposed to the “wolves” on the basis of their study. Where is your protective jealousy, O people of Islam? What about the trust (amaanah) concerning which you will be asked before Allaah tomorrow? Your staying far away from your family was the beginning of this evil, then your getting to know this boy and falling in love with him and becoming so attached that you were afraid to leave him or be far away from him. All of these are things from which you must repent to your Lord before death takes you by surprise when you are in this state. Praise Allaah that there is still some life in your heart which has led you to ask and try to get out of this great calamity. We ask Allaah to save you and keep you safe. Secondly: There are some steps that you have to take in order to rid yourself of this sinful relationship, which could lead to your doom in this world and in the Hereafter. 1 – You must resolve firmly to end this relationship out of fear of Allaah and in the hope that He will forgive you for what has happened in the past, not because this boy has treated you badly and hurt you, but because your Almighty Lord has rights over you and you are a believing woman who must strive to please Him and avoid disobeying Him. 2 – You must cut off all means of communication between you and change your place of residence if possible; indeed you should go back to your family so that Allaah will make it easy for you to be distracted and forget about him, and you can be resolved and able to leave him. 3 – You should occupy yourself with worshipping Allaah, by regularly praying, fasting, reciting dhikr and reading Qur’aan, because if the nafs is not kept busy with acts of obedience to Allaah, it will keep you busy in acts of disobedience to Him, and the shaytaan is closer to the person who is falling short and negligent in his worship and religious commitment. 4 – You should not think about this boy at all or about calling him to Islam, because this is one of the tricks of the shaytaan which is aimed at making you incur the wrath of Allaah. 5 – You should remember that you belong to this great religion, so do not let this evildoer have the joy of you drifting away from it. Remember that it is obligatory for every Muslim to disavow himself of the kaafireen and not feel any love in his heart for any one of them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein (forever). Allaah is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the party of Allaah. Verily, it is the party of Allaah that will be the successful” [al-Mujaadilah 58:22]. 6 – You should look for some righteous friends who can help you to obey Allaah and put a barrier between you and disobedience to Him. You should listen a great deal to tapes of exhortations and raqaa’iq (heart-softening reports) about Paradise and Hell, death and the torment of the grave, so as to increase your faith and make you fear Allaah more, and so that you will realize how insignificant this world and everything in it is, and how important the Hereafter and what Allaah has prepared for its people are. 7 – Say a lot of du’aa’ and ask Allaah to divert evil from you and save you from temptation. For example, you can say: “O Allaah, guide me to what is best for me, and protect me from the evil of my own self. O Allaah, purify my heart and guard my chastity. O Allaah, divert the plot of the Shaytaan away from me. O Controller of the hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion.” What matters is that you should say that with humility and proper focus, and chose the times when du’aa’s are answered, such as between the adhaan and iqaamah, whilst prostrating and in the last third of the night. The du’aa’ does not have to be in words narrated in reports (from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), rather you may ask Allaah for what you need in whatever language you can, declaring your need for Allaah and asking Him to save you, purify you, divert evil from you and cover and conceal you in this world and in the Hereafter. We ask Allaah to guide you and accept your repentance. And Allaah knows best."
308,Acquire the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah,"Question , over about the last two years I have found my dreams frequently coming true. Once In my dream I was looking at the first few words of surah 3, verse 17 which I didn't know of before and only recognized once I bought a copy of The Noble Qur'an and remembered how I had seen a few long words in one line, all spaced out. I even distinctly remember seeing the word 'walmunfiqeen' which at the time of my dream,I thought said 'munaafiqeena',subhaan Allah. At another time, I saw myself going up a kind of ramp at the beginning of which was an arrow marked 'prophets'. It led me to an interior where I felt the bodies of prophets were kept and I felt a bit scared. What came to my mind then was that 25 prophets are mentioned in the Qur'an. And there are other dreams which I cannot all talk about now. But recently I have been seeing myself in my dreams looking at Islamic books in shops and unknown places and asking about books of Hadith. I feel that I should be doing something for Islaam and showing my gratitude to Allah. Please advise me on what I might have to do and how might be the best way of going about it. At the moment, I am in my final year at university. Your reply is eagerly awaited. Jazak-Allah Khair,","Praise be to Allah.It is obvious that your dreams illustrate a strong desire to acquire the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah. It is with no doubt, the best thing a Muslim could spend his time, money and effort pursuing. A Muslim who acquires this knowledge not only benefits himself; he benefits others as well. Our Prophet salla Allah alaihi wasallam told us that Acquiring the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah is a must on every Muslim and that the Angles are so pleased with the Muslim who pursues this knowledge, they put their wings down for him. This indicates how important this issue is. Yet you should make sure that your intention in learning is solely for Allah, and not to show of or to attract attention. Your recall of the word Almunafiqeen, which means the hypocrites, might be a warning sign that you must correct your intention in all acts. Remember that Allah accepts only the deeds that are entirely done for Him alone. Being a good learned Muslim who learns and teaches Islam to others is one of the best ways of showing your gratitude towards Allah, and Allah knows best. Please see the answer to question # 230969 for more on how to seek knowledge."
309,A Weak Narration About the Virtues of Ramadaan,"Question A khateeb (orator) of a masjid in my area mentioned in a khutbah (sermon) a hadeeth narrated by Salman (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), gave them a khutbah in the last day of Sha’aban … etc. Some brothers objected to what the khateeb said in front of the worshippers saying that this hadeeth is fabricated. He also said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever feeds a fasting person, Allah will bless him a drink of my Cistern (Al-Hawdh), he will never feel thirsty after it until he is in Paradise” and also said: “Whoever makes it easy on his slave, Allah will forgive him and free him of the Hellfire”. The brother objected and said: this is lying and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not say this. A person tells lies about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said should expect his place in Hell”. Is the hadeeth mentioned correct or not?","Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth of Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh. He said: Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadhan if the report is saheeh. Then he said: ‘Ali ibn Hijr al-Sa’di told us, Yoosuf ibn Ziyad told us, Humam ibn Yahya told us, from ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’an, from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab, from Salman (may Allah be pleased with them) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha’ban and said: “O people, there has come to you a great month, a blessed month, a month in which there is a night that is better than a thousand months. Allah has made fasting it obligatory and spending its nights in prayer a voluntary act. Whoever draws close (to Allah) during it by doing a good deed will be like one who did an obligatory deed in any other month, and the one who does an obligatory deed in it will be like one who did seventy obligatory deeds in any other month. It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Paradise. It is the month of helping others. It is a month in which the believer’s provision is increased. Whoever gives a fasting person food with which to break his fast will have his sins forgiven and he will be ransomed from the Fire, and he will have a reward like his without it detracting from his reward in the slightest.” They said: Not all of us can find something to give to the fasting person with which to break his fast. He said: “Allah will give this reward to the one who gives a fasting person a date or a drink of water or a sip of milk. It is a month the beginning of which is mercy, the middle of which is forgiveness and the end of which is ransom from the Fire. The one who reduces the burden for his slave will be forgiven by Allah, and He will ransom him from the Fire. So do a lot of four good deeds during it, two with which you will please your Lord and two which you cannot do without. As for the two good deeds with which you will please your Lord, they are bearing witness that there is no god except Allah, and seeking His forgiveness. As for those which you cannot do without, they are asking Allah for Paradise and seeking refuge with Him from Hell. Whoever feeds a fasting person until he is full, Allah will give him to drink from my Cistern, a drink after which he will not thirst again until he enters Paradise.” Its isnad (chain of narration) includes ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’an, who is da’eef (weak) because of his bad memory. Its isnad also includes Yoosuf ibn Ziyad al-Basri, whose hadeeth is munkar (rejected). It also includes Humam ibn Yahya ibn Dinar al-‘Awadi, concerning whom Ibn Hajar said in al-Taqreeb: He is trustworthy but he may make mistakes. Based on this, the hadeeth with this isnad is not false, but it is weak. However, many of the virtues of Ramadhan are proven in the saheeh ahadeeth (authentic narrations).

310,Does Pus Break Fast?,Question Does water (pus) coming out of acne wounds invalidate the fast? And what if the amount of blood coming out of such a wound is small? Does it invalidate fasting?,"Praise be to Allah.Does pus break fast? The fasting person is not affected if blood comes out of his wounds and that does not invalidate his fast. Rather the difference of scholarly opinion has to do with wet cupping in particular. The more correct opinion is that it does invalidate the fast because of the text which indicates that, which is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The cupper and the one for whom cupping is done both break their fast.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2367; Ibn Majah, 1679. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) Does bleeding break your fast? Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If a person is fasting and he bleeds, does he have to break his fast or should he complete it? He replied: “Bleeding does not affect him, except in the case of cupping , if he is treated with cupping. The correct view is that the fast is broken by cupping. There is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the matter, but the correct view is that it does break the fast, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The cupper and the one for whom cupping is done both break their fast.” But if he has a nosebleed or is injured in his foot or hand when he is fasting, his fast remains valid and that does not affect him.” (From the Shaykh’s website) Some of the scholars differentiate with regard to bleeding in general between that which occurs as the result of a person’s actions and choice and results in a lot of blood coming out, as in the case of donating blood , for example, which does break the fast, by analogy with cupping, and that in which he has no choice, such as injuries and the like, which does not break the fast even if there is a lot of blood. With regard to pus and the like coming out of wounds, this does not affect the one who is fasting. It says in ad-Diya al-Lami‘ min al-Khutab al-Jawami‘ (5/465), by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him): “The fast is not broken by lancing a wound to drain the pus from it, even if blood comes out.” And Allah knows best."
311,Is it permissible for the muezzin to give the adhaan whilst seated?,Question I was wondering is it permissible to do the adhan for a masjid or a musalla whilst one is sitting down or lying down on ones back? Could you please provide any daleel from the Quran and sunnah.,"Praise be to Allah. The Sunnah is for the muezzin to give the adhaan whilst standing, as the muezzin of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do and as the Muslims have done from then until the present day. There is consensus on this matter. If he gives the adhaan whilst sitting or lying down without an excuse, his adhaan is valid but makrooh. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He should give the adhaan standing. Ibn al-Mundhir said: All of the scholars from whom I have acquired knowledge are agreed that the Sunnah is to give the adhaan standing. According to the hadeeth of Abu Qataadah that we have quoted, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to Bilaal: “Stand up and give the call to prayer.” The muezzins of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to give the call to prayer standing. If he has an excuse, then there is nothing wrong with him giving the call whilst sitting. Al-Hasan al-‘Abdi said: I saw Abu Zayd, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when his legs had been injured (in battle) for the sake of Allah, giving the adhaan whilst seated. This was narrated by al-Athram. If he gives the adhaan whilst sitting without an excuse, then this is regarded as makrooh by the scholars, although it is valid. This issue is not more important than that of giving a khutbah, and it is valid if done by one who is sitting. End quote from al-Mughni, 1/253 This version of the hadeeth of Abu Qataadah was also narrated by al-Bukhaari (595) Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Sunnah is to give the call to prayer standing and facing towards the qiblah. If he gives the call sitting or lying down, or not facing towards the qiblah, it is makrooh but his adhaan is valid, because the aim is to announce the prayer, and this has been achieved. End quote from al-Majmoo‘, 3/114. And Allah knows best."
312,How can he get rid of shares in riba-based banks?,"Question A man bought shares in a bank that deals in riba, and now he wants to get rid of them. What should he do?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: It is not permissible to buy shares in riba-based banks or in companies that are based on riba, because that is consuming riba, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it. Narrated by Muslim (1597). In a statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council during its seventh conference, held in Jeddah in 1412 AH, it says: There is no dispute that shares in companies whose basic aims are haraam, such as dealing with riba, producing haraam things or dealing in haraam things, are also haraam. End quote. Majallat al-Majma’ al-Fiqhi, no. 7, vol. 1, p. 711 Secondly: If a person has bought these shares, he has to repent to Allaah by regretting what he has done, resolving not to do it again, and getting out of the company or bank, and selling these shares. He is not entitled to anything more than his capital, and whatever is greater than his capital he must spend it on charitable causes. The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: I had some shares in a company, and this company went bankrupt 25 years ago. There were trustees of the company who bought into the Riyadh bank with what was left of the shares, 25 years ago, each share costing 1000 riyals. Now the price of one share is 30,000 riyals. I need this money, so is it permissible to take the current value of the share, knowing that they bought these shares in the Riyadh bank without us knowing all this time? They replied: You should take the entire amount, the capital and the interest, then keep the capital, because that belongs to you, and give the interest in charity, because it is riba. Allaah will make you independent of means by His bounty, and will compensate you with something better than it, and He will help you to meet your needs. “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). 3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him.” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3] End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (13/506) It also says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (13/508): It is not permissible to buy shares in banks or companies that deal with riba. If our correspondent wants to get rid of his riba-based shares, he may sell them at the market price, then keep his original capital only; the rest he should spend on charitable causes. It is not permissible for him to take any of the interest or riba-based profits of his shares. But if the shares were in a company that does not deal in riba, then the profits on them are halaal. End quote. And Allaah knows best."
313,Is he sinning if he goes against the traffic rules?,"Question Is a person sinning if he goes against the least important traffic rules, such as going slightly over the speed limit, not using his signals (indicators), not exiting the lane in the correct manner, or not leaving enough space between his car and the car in front? Is it important to comply fully with these rules, or does the least infraction incur sin because he is not obeying those who are in authority?","Praise be to Allah.Everything that could cause harm to a Muslim or the Muslims is forbidden according to Islamic teachings. If the traffic rules help to protect against harm, then they must be followed. And Allah knows best."
314,Ruling on homoeopathy,Question I want to know the ruling on using homoeopathy as a remedy. I found out that the medicine used is a liquid that contains alcohol that is used to preserve the medicine. Is it permissible to use this remedy?.,"Praise be to Allah.Homoeopathy or treating like with like means giving the patient small doses of the same thing that causes the sickness. Research studies are still ongoing concerning this kind of medical treatment, and there is not yet any definitive proof of its efficacy in the world of medicine. In al-Mawsoo‘ah al-‘Arabiyyah al-‘Aalamiyyah it says: Homoeopathy is a kind of medical treatment that is based on the principle of “let like cure like.” According to the practitioners of this method, the substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person will cure the same symptoms in a sick person. Some plants, for example, cause rashes on the skin, so homoeopathic doctors treat the rash with the same plants. Onions cause tearing in the eyes and make the nose run, so onion is used to treat nasal secretions caused by the cold. The German doctor Samuel Hahnemann developed the rules of homoeopathy at the end of the eighteenth century. Homoeopathic remedies were discovered by means of a process called “provings”, in which various experiments were carried out on healthy people and their effects watched closely; the homoeopathic doctor gives only one remedy to the patient at a time, because they believe that using more than one remedy will affect the efficacy of each remedy, and the medicine is reduced so that the patient is given the lowest effective dose of the medicine. It is believed that this approach will give the best possible results and also prevent harmful side effects. Many homeopathic remedies contain substances that may be poisonous or dangerous to human beings if the doses were increased. In addition to that, the medical efficacy of the homoeopathic remedies has not been proven scientifically. For these reasons, homeopathy has been subjected to criticism by many doctors. End quote. Secondly: With regard to what these remedies contain of substances, we should find out what they are in order to determine the ruling concerning them according to the shar‘i evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah. (a) With regard to poisonous substances, some scholars forbid the consumption of poison in either large or small amounts, whether it is harmful or expected to be beneficial. Other scholars permit it, but they laid down guidelines with regard to that. Those who say that it is permissible say that the effect of this poison should be examined, and the extent to which it will benefit the patient’s body; it is also essential that that be done in the light of numerous experiments so as to have peace of mind regarding the outcome; and these medicines should only be used to ward off a greater harm. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to medicines that contain poison, if it is thought most likely that drinking or using it will result in death or insanity, then it is not permissible to use it. If it is thought most likely that it is safe and there is the hope of benefit from it, then it is better to permit taking it, so as to ward off what is more dangerous, as is the case with other medicines. It may be that it is not permissible, because he is exposing himself to death, but the first view is more correct, because in many cases there is the fear that medicines may cause some harm, but they have still been permitted, so as to ward off a greater harm. End quote from al-Mughni, 1/447 (b) With regard to using medicine that contains alcohol, it should be noted that there are two matters having to do with alcohol here: (i) is alcohol najis or not? And (ii) does mixing it with other medicines have any effect on it or not? With regard to the former, the majority of scholars are of the view that alcohol is tangibly impure, and others are of the view that it is intangibly impure. With regard to the latter, when alcohol is mixed with other medicines, it either has a clear, strong and obvious effect, or it does not. If its effect is clear, strong and obvious, the mixture is haraam and using this medicine is haraam. If the alcohol does not have that effect on this medicine, it is permissible to use it. There is a difference between consuming alcohol directly and mixing it with something else. If it is consumed on its own, it is not permissible even in small amounts, but if it is mixed with something else, then the ruling varies according to the details given above. For a fatwa of the scholars of the Standing Committee concerning that, please see the answer to question no. 40530. For a detailed fatwa by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen, please see the answer to question no. 59899. To sum up: 1.Homoeopathy has not been proven to be beneficial according to medical specialists, and there are those who are strongly opposed to it. 2.Do not use any remedy unless it has been proven to be beneficial, for most patients, on the basis of either certainty or overwhelming likelihood. 3.Beware of medicines that contain poisonous substances or alcohol, unless the amount is small and it is proven that that medicine is beneficial for most patients according to confirmed studies and proven results. 4.We advise you to use ruqyah as prescribed in sharee‘ah, composed of Qur’aan and adhkaar and du‘aa’s that are narrated in sharee‘ah; read them over yourself and seek the help of Allah, asking Him to ward off sickness from you. And we advise you to use medicines that Islam has stated are beneficial and useful, such as honey and black seed. There is nothing wrong with referring to doctors concerning specific amounts and how to use them. We ask Allah to heal and grant well-being to the sick Muslims. And Allah knows best."
315,Where Should Wife Stand When Praying With Husband?,"Question I have recently got married, alhumdulillah, and could you tell me can one pray jama`ah with his wife and if so how?","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a man to lead his wife in prayer , and the woman should stand behind the man, because it is not permissible for her to stand with him, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led Anas and the orphan in prayer, he made Umm Sulaym – who was the mother of Anas – stand behind them . It is also indicated by the report narrated from Anas ibn Malik, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led him and his mother or maternal aunt in prayer. He said, “He made me stand to his right and he made the woman stand behind us.” (Muslim, al-Masajid wa Mawadi’ al-Salah, 1056) Al-Kasaani said: “If there is a woman praying with the imam , he should make her stand behind him.” Ibn Rushd al-Hafid said: “There is no dispute concerning the fact that a lone woman may pray behind the imam and that if there is also a man present, the man should pray beside the imam and the woman should pray behind him.” (See Ahkam al-Imamah wa’l-Itimam by al-Munif, p. 319-320) For more, please see these answers: 2034 , 12451 , 93369 , 3832 , and 65685 . And Allah knows best."
316,Who took care of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after his mother died?,Question Who took care of The Prophet Muhammad after his parents died?.,"Praise be to Allah. The one who took care of him was his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib, then after his grandfather died, his paternal uncle Abu Taalib took care of him. Both of them died as disbelievers, but ‘Abd al-Muttalib died before the Prophet’s mission began. Abu Taalib died about ten years after the Prophet’s mission began, after refusing to enter Islam. Ibn Katheer said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was with his mother Aaminah bint Wahb, then when she died, his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib took care of him. He used to sit on his cushion and ‘Abd al-Muttaalib would not eat any food without saying “Bring me my son” and he would be brought to him. When ‘Abd al-Muttalib was on his deathbed, he told Abu Taalib to take care of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Ibn Ishaaq said: When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached the age of eight years, his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib ibn Haashim died. After his grandfather, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stayed with his paternal uncle Abu Taalib, in accordance with the last wishes of ‘Abd al-Muttalib, and because he was the full-brother of (the Prophet’s) father ‘Abd-Allaah – their mother was Faatimah bint ‘Amr ibn ‘Imraan ibn Makhzoom. So Abu Taalib was the one who looked after the affairs of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Abu Taalib had no wealth, but he loved him deeply, more than he loved his own children; he would not sleep unless he was his side, and when he went out he would go out with him, and he used to keep the best food for him. Al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, vol. 2, p. 282."
317,He wants something that will guide him in his worldly and religious affairs,Question Can you advise us of something that will guide us in our worldly and religious affairs?,"Praise be to Allah. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked the following question: I ask the shaykh and imaam, the follower of the salaf (earlier generations) and the leader of the later generations, the most knowledgeable man whom I have met in the east or the west, Taqiy al-Deen Abu’l-Abbaas Ahmad Ibn Taymiyah, to advise me of something that will guide me in my worldly and religious affairs. He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied as follows: With regard to advice, I do not know of any advice more beneficial than the advice of Allaah and His Messenger, for those who understand it and follow it: “And verily, We have recommended to the people of the Scripture before you, and to you (O Muslims) that you (all) fear Allaah, and keep your duty to Him”[al-Nisaa’ 4:131] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised Mu’aadh, when he sent him to Yemen, “O Mu’aadh, fear Allaah wherever you are, and follow up a bad deed with a good deed, and it will wipe it out, and treat people in a kind manner.” Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him) was held in high esteem by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he said to him, “O Mu’aadh, by Allaah I love you.” And he used to let him ride behind him. It was narrated that he was the most knowledgeable of this ummah concerning halaal and haraam, that he will be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection) one step ahead of the scholars. One of his virtues is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent him to Yemen to convey the message from him, as a daa’iyah, mufti and judge for the people of Yemen. And he used to liken him to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), and Ibraaheem was a leader of mankind. And Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to say that Mu’aadh was an ummah (a leader having all the good righteous qualities), obedient to Allaah, and he was not one of the mushrikeen (cf. al-Nahl 16:120), likening him to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). Moreover, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave him this advice, so we should note that it is concise and comprehensive. It is like that for the one who understands it, even though it is an interpretation of advice given in the Qur’aan. With regard to its conciseness, that is because each person has two duties: his duty towards Allaah and his duty towards others. It is inevitable that he will fall short sometimes with regard to those duties, either by failing to do something he is commanded to do or by doing something he is forbidden to do. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah wherever you are.” This is a comprehensive phrase. The words “wherever you are” refer to the need for taqwa in secret and in the open. Then he said: “and follow up a bad deed with a good deed, and it will wipe it out”. For when the doctor sees a patient and realizes that he has ingested something harmful, he will tell him to take something that is good for him. Sin is something inevitable for man, so the smart man is the one who keeps doing good deeds so that they will wipe out his bad deeds. In the wording of the hadeeth, the word sayi’ah (bad deed) is mentioned first, even though it is the object, because the aim here is to wipe out bad deeds, not to emphasize good deeds. The good deeds should be of a similar nature to the bad deeds, for that will be more effective in wiping them out. The consequences of sin may be erased by several things, the first of which is repentance, and the second is seeking forgiveness (istighfaar) without repenting, for Allaah may forgive him in response to his du’aa’ even though he has not repented. But if repentance and seeking forgiveness are combined, this is perfect. The third thing is doing righteous deeds that expiate for sin. With regard to specific acts of expiation, such as those prescribed for one who has intercourse during the day in Ramadaan, one who divorces his wife by zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce by which a man says to his wife “You are to me as my mother’s back), the one who commits some actions which are forbidden during Hajj or who fails to fulfil some of its obligations and the one who hunts during Hajj, these expiations are of four types: offering a sacrifice, freeing a slave, giving in charity and fasting. With regard to kinds of expiation that are not specified, as Hudhayfah said to ‘Umar: The fitnah faced by a man (i.e., his shortcomings with regard to religious duties) because of his family, wealth and children may be expiated by prayer, fasting, charity and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. This is indicated by the Qur’aan and the saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of expiation via the five daily prayers, Jumu’ah, fasting, Hajj and all the actions concerning which it is said, whoever says such and such or does such and such, he will be forgiven, or his previous sins will be forgiven. There are many such reports in the books of Sunan, especially those books which have been written concerning virtuous deeds. It should be noted that paying attention to such matters is one of the things of which man is in the greatest need. When a person reaches the age of puberty, especially in these times and similar periods which resemble the time of jaahiliyyah in so many ways, the person who grows up among knowledgeable and religious people may be affected by matters of jaahiliyyah to some extent, so how about others? In al-Saheehayn it is narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You will follow the path of those who came before you step by step, so that even if they entered the hole of a lizard, you will enter it too.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, do you mean the Jews and Christians?” He said, “Who else?” This report is confirmed by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “so enjoy your portion (awhile) as those before you enjoyed their portion (awhile); and you indulged in play and pastime (and in telling lies against Allaah and His Messenger Muhammad) as they indulged in play and pastime” [al-Tawbah 9:69] And there are further corroborating reports in the saheeh and hasan ahaadeeth. This is something which affects those among the elite who claim to be religiously committed, as more than one of the salaf, including Ibn ‘Uyayanah, said. For many of the characteristics of the Jews are things from which some of those who claim to be knowledgeable are suffering, and many of the characteristics of the Christians are things from which some of those who claim to be religiously-committed are suffering – as is clear to everyone who understands the religion of Islam with which Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then tries to understand people in the light of Islam. If this is the case, then the one whose heart Allaah opens to Islam will be following light from his Lord, for he was dead then Allaah revived him and gave him light by which to walk among mankind. So he will inevitably notice the characteristics of jaahiliyyah and the path of the two nations with whom Allaah is angry and who have gone astray, namely the Jews and Christians, and he will see that he is also afflicted with some of that. The most useful thing that both the elite and the common folk may know is that which will cleanse their souls of these bad effects, and that is following bad deeds with good deeds. Good deeds are those which Allaah has encouraged on the lips of the final Prophet, whether they are actions, attitudes or characteristics. Among the things which remove the consequences of sin are disasters or calamities which expiate sin; these include all kinds of anxiety, grief or harm with regard to wealth, honour, one’s body, and so on, but which are not brought about by a person’s own actions. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had stated the rights of Allaah with regard to doing righteous deeds and putting right bad deeds, he then said, “and treat people in a kind manner”. This refers to one’s duty towards other people. A good attitude towards other people is based on maintaining contact with one who cuts you off by greeting him with salaam, honouring him, making du’aa’ for him, praying for forgiveness for him, praising him and visiting him; giving to one who has deprived you of knowledge, benefits and money; forgiving one who has wronged you with regard to blood, wealth or honour. Some of these matters are waajib (obligatory) and some are mustahabb (encouraged). With regard to the “exalted standard of character” [al-Qalam 68:4] with which Allaah described Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), this is the religion which includes all that Allaah has enjoined. Hence Mujaahid said that he was the interpretation of the Qur’aan, as ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “His character was the Qur’aan.” The essence of his character was that he hastened to do what Allaah loves with a willing spirit and an open heart. All of this may be summed up in the word taqwa (fear of Allaah), which includes doing everything that Allaah has enjoined whether it is waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (recommended), and avoiding all that He has forbidden, whether it is haraam (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked). This combines both duties towards Allaah and duties towards other people. But as taqwa may sometimes mean fearing the punishment which makes one refrain from forbidden things, it was explained in the hadeeth of Mu’aadh. Similarly, in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with them) which was narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, “it was said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, which thing most commonly brings people into Paradise?’ He said, ‘Fear of Allaah (taqwa) and a good attitude.’ It was said, ‘And which thing most commonly brings people into Hell?’ He said, ‘The two hollow things: the mouth and the private parts.’” In al-Saheeh it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The most perfect of the believers in faith is the one who is best in attitude.” So he connected perfection of faith to good attitude. It is well known that faith is all fear of Allaah (taqwa), but this is not the place to discuss the basic principles and minor details of that. This is the whole of religion, but the source of goodness is sincere devotion of the slave to his Lord, worshipping Him alone and seeking His help alone, as in the aayahs (interpretation of the meaning): “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [al-Faatihah 1:5] “So worship Him (O Muhammad) and put your trust in Him”[Hood 11:123] “in Him I trust and unto Him I repent”[Hood 11:88] “so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:17] Thus the slave does away with any hope of benefiting from created beings and does not strive for their sake, and he focuses all his concern on his Lord, by praying to him for all his needs, fears, etc., and striving to do all that He loves."
318,Affirming that Allaah does descend (to the lowest heaven),"Question ""...When half o a third of the night passes by, Allah descends to the lowest heaven and says: 'No one asks more about my servants thatn myself. Who is asking me, so I can give to him? Who is calling uon me, so I can answer him? who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?'"". I got two questions about this hadith. How sahee ( or correct ) is this hadith. And second, what meaning is this hadith?.","Praise be to Allah. Your question covers two matters: 1 – The extent to which this hadeeth is saheeh. This hadeeth is a saheeh hadeeth which is proven in the soundest two books after the Book of Allaah. It was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (1145) and by Muslim (1261) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the night remains and says: ‘Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’” This hadeeth was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by approximately twenty-eight of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) and the Ahl al-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that it is to be accepted. 2 – What is meant by the descent of Allaah – may He be exalted – to the lowest heaven: It should be noted that the descent of the Lord – may He be exalted – to the lowest heaven is one of the actions that are attributed to Him and has to do with His will and wisdom. It is descending in a real sense, in a manner that befits His majesty and might. Allaah descends however He wills, whenever He wills. Glory be to Him, there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. It is not permissible to distort the meaning of the hadeeth by saying that what is meant is that His command or mercy descends, or that one of His angels descends. This is false for several reasons: (i)This misinterpretation goes against the apparent meaning of the hadeeth. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) attributed descent or the act of descending to Allaah, and the basic principle is that a thing is attributed to the one who does it, so if it is attributed to someone else, that is a distortion that goes against this basic principle. We know that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the most knowledgeable of all people about Allaah, and that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the most eloquent of mankind and the most truthful in what he says. There are no lies in his speech and it is impossible for him to attribute something to Allaah that is not one of His names or attributes or actions or rulings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allaah), 45. We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), 46. And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)” [al-Haaqqah 69:44-46] Moreover the only intention of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was to guide mankind, so if he said, “Our Lord descends” and someone else says something that runs contrary to the apparent meaning of these words, such as saying that His command descends, then we say: Do you have more knowledge about Allaah than the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Our Lord descends” but you say His command descends. Or are you more sincere towards the ummah than he was, since he (allegedly) concealed what he was supposed to tell them and told them something different. Undoubtedly the person who tells the people one thing but means something else is not sincere towards them. Or do you think that you are more eloquent than the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?! Undoubtedly such a misinterpretation implies that one is accusing the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of some kind of shortcoming that a Muslim can never accept on the part of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). (ii)The descent of His command and mercy is not restricted to this part of the night, rather His command and mercy descend all the time. If it is said that what is meant is a specific command or specific mercy which does not happen all the time, the answer to that is that if we assume that this interpretation is correct, then the hadeeth indicates that where the descent of this thing ends is in the lowest heaven, so what benefit can it be to us if mercy descend to the lowest heaven without reaching us? Why would the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) even tell us about it? (iii)The hadeeth indicates that the One Who descends says: “Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?” No one can say that except Allaah, may He be exalted. See: Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, 1/203-210."
319,"She had a contract to work for two years, but the contract was cancelled after one year and she is still receiving the salary","Question One year ago I had a two year contract with ministry of education as an alternative teacher. After one year my contract was cancelled. But I received my salary into my account for six months although I stopped working. My name remained as well in the lists of working individuals in my sector, although my contract was cancelled. I went to check the matter but no one listened to me. Is it permissible for me to use this salary I received after I stopped working or not? Bear in mind that I was prevented from renewing my contract by adding my name on working individuals list.","Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with you taking the salary if the contract was cancelled by them, and there was no refusal to work or any shortcoming on your part. The basic principle in this case is that a work contract is binding, and that the employee is entitled to payment throughout the period agreed upon, even if he is not given any work to do or the employer has no need of him, so long as he is prepared to work and does not refuse to do so. It says in al-Muqni’: Employment is a contract that is binding on both parties, and none of them has the right to cancel it, but if he wants to do so before the time is up, he is obliged to pay the wages. End quote. It says in al-Sharh al-Kabeer (14/436): Employment is a binding contract which means that the employee must be given the wages and the employer must be given the work. If the employer cancels the contract before the period ends and does not demand the work, the contract is not annulled and he must pay the wages. You should contact the ministry of education to see about renewing the contract and related matters. And Allaah knows best."

What the Muslim must do is be a good example of trustworthiness, fulfilling covwnants and good attitude. The fact that Muslims had these qualities was a cause of many kuffaar entering Islam when they saw the beauties of Islam and the good attitude and conduct of its people. Treachery and betrayal are forbidden in Islam, whether that is with a Muslim or a kaafir. What the Muslim is required to do is to respect the covenant between him and the country where he is or to which he has travelled, even if it is a kaafir country. The fact that it is a kaafir country does not make it permissible to betray it and consume its wealth unlawfully. So long as that country has granted safety to the Muslim who entered it, and it is giving him protection and protecting his wealth, then he is required to be honest towards that country, and it is not permissible for him to betray it or cheat it. Based on that, that country is within its rights to admit whomever it wants and refuse whomever it wants. If any Muslim enters that land, it is not permissible for him to deceive them or cheat them, whether that is done to the state itself or to its citizens, institutions or companies. He does not have the right to insist that they admit his family into their country or grant him permanent residency. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for betraying them, it is haraam, because they only granted him safety on condition that he refrain from betraying them and that he protect them from himself (i.e., harm caused by him). Even if that is not mentioned in so many words, it is implied and understood. End quote. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible to take the wealth of a kaafir, when they have trusted one, by dishonest means, because people may travel together on the basis of trust, and trusts must be rendered back to their people whether they are Muslims or kaafirs. End quote. Based on that, what you have to do is return to them the money that you took from them. See also the answer to questions no. 50716, 126378, 14367, 109351 And Allah knows best."
321,Is a Christian woman required to observe ‘iddah if her Muslim husband divorces her?,"Question I am a young Algerian man married to a foreign Christian woman who has an inclination towards Islam. But Allah has willed that we should separate. My question is: is the kitaabi (Jewish or Christian) woman required to observe ‘iddah and do I have to impose it on her if she refuses to observe ‘iddah? There is a second problem, which is that I am living in her house and I do not have any other accommodation to go to. What is the Islamic ruling concerning that?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The kitaabi (Jewish or Christian) wife should observe ‘iddah following divorce or death of the husband, just like the Muslim woman. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (29/336): The Hanafis, Maalikis, Shaafa‘is and Hanbalis, as well as ath-Thawri and Abu ‘Ubayd, are of the view that the kitaabi or dhimmi woman is required to observe ‘iddah in the event of divorce, annulment of the marriage or death of the husband, just like the Muslim woman, because of the general meaning of the evidence that the ‘iddah is required, and no differentiation is made between them on condition that the husband is Muslim, because the ‘iddah is required and is a duty towards Allah and towards the husband. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no Iddah (divorce prescribed period, see have you to count in respect of themem” [al-Ahzaab 33:49]. So this is his right, and the rights of humans are also due from the kitaabi and dhimmi wife. So she is required to observe ‘iddah and she should be compelled to do so, because of the rights of the husband and child (if she is pregnant), because she is one of those who are required to fulfil the rights of others. End quote. Secondly: Living with a wife who is observing ‘iddah varies according to the type of divorce. If it is a revocable divorce (first or second talaaq), then there is nothing wrong with it, because the revocably divorced wife comes under the same ruling as one who is still a wife. But if it was the final, irrevocable talaaq, then she is a non-mahram and in that case it is not permissible to look at her or be alone with her. Undoubtedly their staying in the same house will make it difficult to adhere to these shar‘i guidelines of not being alone with her and of her observing hijab in front of him, as she should do in front of all non-mahrams. However, if the house is spacious and it is possible to allocate one part for him, with a separate entrance and separate facilities, (then it may be possible for them to live in the same house). But if they are both in the same house, sharing the same entrance and facilities, then it is very difficult to avoid the forbidden matters mentioned above. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The thrice-divorced woman is a non-mahram to the man and is like any other non-mahram woman, so the man does not have the right to be alone with her just as he does not have the right to be alone with any other non-mahram woman; he does not have the right to look at her except what he may look at of any other non-mahram woman. End quote from al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 3/349 The irrevocably-divorced woman is the one who has been divorced three times. As for the one who has been divorced once or twice, and her ‘iddah has ended without the husband taking her back, she is not permissible for her husband except with a new marriage contract. And Allah knows best."
322,What is the definition of the poor to whom the fidyah for not fasting may be given? And how much should be given and when?,"Question Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)” [al-Baqarah 2:184]. Is it essential that this poor person be an adult? If a person wants to feed thirty poor persons, are the children and dependents of a poor person included in this number? Is it acceptable to give money instead of food? How much food should be given?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is not permissible for anyone who is able to fast in Ramadan, and who has no legitimate excuse, not to fast. Not everyone who does not fast because of a concession is required to feed a poor person for every day. Rather feeding the poor is required of those who are elderly or are suffering a chronic illness for which there is no hope of recovery. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184] Ibn ‘Abbaas said: This refers to an old man or an old woman who are not able to fast, so for each day they should feed one poor person.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4505. The person who is suffering from a chronic illness from which there is no hope of recovery comes under the same ruling as an old man. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The sick person for whom there is no hope of recovery may break the fast, and he should feed one poor person for each day, because he is like an old man.""(Al-Mughni, 4/396). Secondly: It is not essential that this poor person be an adult, rather the food may be given to a child who eats regular food, according to scholarly consensus. But the imams differed with regard to giving it to a nursing infant. The majority of scholars (including Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad) are of the view that this is permissible, because he is a poor person who is included in the general meaning of this verse. The apparent meaning of the words of Imam Maalik is that food should not be given to a nursing infant, but he said that it is permissible to give it to a weanling. This view was favoured by al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him). See: al-Mughni, 13/508; al-Insaaf, 23/342; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/101-103. Thirdly: The children, wife and family of a poor person on whom he is obliged to spend may be included in this number, if they do not have enough to live on and there is no one else who can spend on them apart from this poor man. Hence the poor man may be given zakaah that is sufficient for him and his family. It says in al-Rawd al-Murbi’ (3/311): The two types – i.e., the poor (fuqara’) and needy (masaakeen) – may both be given what is sufficient for them and their dependents. End quote. Fourthly: As for what is to be given and how much, the poor person should be given half a saa’ (approximately one and a half kilograms) of the local staple food, whether it is rice, dates or anything else. If some condiment or meat is also given, that is better. Al-Bukhari narrated in a mu’allaq report from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that when he grew old and was unable to fast, he did not fast and he would give bread and meat to a poor person for each day. It is not permissible to give the equivalent value of the food in money. Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: Feeding the poor is not to be done by giving cash as you mentioned, rather it is done by giving the food that is the local staple food. So each day half a saa’ of the usual local staple food is to be given, and half a saa’ is equivalent to approximately one and half kilograms. So you have to give this amount of the local staple food for each day, and do not give cash, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184] He specifically mentioned food.

323,Where Is Al-Mahdi Now?,"Question Will the expected Mahdi resemble the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? What about the voices that have emerged in recent times and claim that he is here and has been born, i.e., he exists at present?","Praise be to Allah.Who is al-Mahdi? The appearance of the Mahdi at the end of time, when he will fill the earth with justice and fairness after it had been filled with injustice and wrongdoing, is something that is mentioned in the authentic Sunnah, and some of the scholars of hadith said: The hadiths about the Mahdi are mutawatir because of their large number, and the descent of ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace and blessings be upon him and our Prophet) and his praying behind him is something that is well known. What is the name of Al-Mahdi? The name of the Mahdi and the name of his father will be like the name of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the name of his father; he will be one of the descendents of Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her). The Mahdi who is mentioned in the hadiths is not the so-called awaited Mahdi mentioned by that deviant group, the Ithna ‘Ashari (Shi’ah) who claim that he entered the tunnel and is awaiting the order to emerge, and whose name they say is Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-‘Askari. This is an illusion and a myth, and the refutation of that is discussed in books, and there is no room to go into it here. But we advise you to read Minhaj al-Sunnah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and summaries of it such as Manhaj al-I’tidal by al-Dhahabi, and Tuhfat al-Ithna ‘Ashariyyah by Muhibb al-Din al-Khatib. It is essential to note that every group is awaiting a Mahdi such as the Jews who are awaiting the Mahdi, but for them he will be the Dajjal who will be followed by the Jews of Isfahan. The Christians are awaiting a Mahdi which is the descent of the Messiah (Second Coming of Christ). We Muslims have no doubt about the descent of ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), when he will break the cross and kill the pigs, and will abolish jizyah and rule according to the Shari’ah of Islam, and at that time there will be no war. Throughout history, there have appeared liars who claimed to be the Mahdi. Some historians have counted them and said that there were more than thirty of them, including Ibn Tumart in Morocco and the Mahdi of the Sudan, etc. Where is al-Mahdi now? As for the view that Al-Mahdi exists at present and that he has been born, this is merely a claim that is made by some people, but there is no evidence for it. It is most likely that it is a myth. The hadiths that have been narrated about the Mahdi do not mention where he will be born or when, and they do not tell us to look for him or to bring him up, rather they say that Allah will prepare him in a single night and that the Muslims will swear allegiance to him as their caliph and will be united behind him. When will that happen? Only Allah knows. And Allah knows best."
324,Did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have a Jewish servant boy?,Question Did the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have a Jewish servant?,"Praise be to Allah. Yes, it is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and elsewhere that a Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). On one occasion he fell sick and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) visited him and invited him to Islam. This is the story as it was narrated by Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him): A Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he fell sick. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to visit him. He sat by his head and said: “Become Muslim.” The boy looked at his father, who was also by his head, and his father said to him: Obey Abu’l-Qaasim (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So he became Muslim, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) left, saying, “Praise be to Allah Who have saved him from the Fire.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1356). But the sources do not tell us the name of this boy or anything about his service to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and they do not mention anything about the reason why the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted his service. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (3/221): “A Jewish boy used to serve…” – I have not come across anything narrated via complete isnaads about his name, except that Ibn Bashkuwaal stated that the author of al-‘Atabiyyah narrated from Ziyaad Shaytoon that this boy’s name was ‘Abd al-Quddoos. He said: This is an odd report; I did not find it with anyone else. End quote. All that there is, is the fact that some of the commentators suggested that this boy participated in bewitching the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as he was the one who took some of the hair of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and gave it to Labeed ibn al-A‘sam, the Jewish man who was a practitioner of witchcraft. However this report has not been proven to be sound. Al-Qurtubi said in al-Jaami‘ li Ahkaam al-Qur’an (20/232): Al-Qushayri stated in his Tafseer that it was narrated in the Saheehs that a Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Jews contacted him and kept on at him until he took some hairs that had fallen from the head of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) when he combed his hair, and he took some of the teeth of his comb, and gave them to the Jews, who used them to bewitch him, and the one who did that was the Jew Labeed ibn al-A‘sam. End quote. See a similar report in Zaad al-Maseer by Ibn al-Jawzi (9/270) From the story of the Jewish boy serving the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) we see an example of the tolerance, easy-going nature and gentleness that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) carried in his compassionate heart, and that he was merciful and compassionate towards all people; he hoped for good for them and warned them against evil. So he did not hesitate to visit this Jewish boy at home when he was sick, and he did not miss any opportunity to call them to true guidance. But they responded with plots and treachery, and they tried to kill him and put poison in his food. For more information on the way of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his interactions with the Jews, please see question no. 84308 And Allah knows best."
325,He visualizes the Ka’bah when he prays and says du’aa’. Is this ihsaan?,"Question When I am praying and saying du’aa’, I try to visualize the Ka’bah. Am I achieving what is meant in the hadeeth, “Worship Allaah as if you see Him”? When I visualize something else – which happens often and is not waswaas – I feel that I am not attaining complete khushoo’ (focus), and when I am addressing Allaah I try to feel that. (And I do this) because looking at the sky is makrooh. Please advise me, may Allaah bless you.","Praise be to Allah.Ihsaan means doing a thing well. In sharee’ah this includes doing acts of worship well and in the manner enjoined by Allaah. If the worshipper remembers that Allaah is watching him and looking at him, this will make him do his act of worship well and enable him to reach a high status thereby. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: One day the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings be upon him) appeared before the people and Jibreel came to him and said: O Messenger of Allaah, what is faith? He said: “To believe in Allaah, His angels, His Book, the meeting with Him, and His Messengers, and to believe in the resurrection hereafter.” He said: O Messenger of Allaah, what is Islam? He said: “Islam is to worship Allaah and not associate anything with Him, to establish the prescribed prayers, to pay the obligatory zakaah, and to fast Ramadaan.” He said: O Messenger of Allaah, what is ihsaan? He said: “It is to worship Allaah as if you can see Him, for although you cannot see Him, He can see you.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (50) and Muslim (9). Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that one should worship Allaah in this manner, which is keeping in mind that He is close, and that is He is before you as if you could see Him. This leads one to fear Him, venerate Him and show respect. It also leads one to be sincere in worship and strive hard to do it well and make it perfect and complete. End quote. Jaami’ al-‘Uloom al-Hukam (1/35). He also said: The basic meaning of khushoo’ is softness of heart, tranquility, submission and humility. If the heart is properly focused in this manner, then the rest of the body will follow it in focus, because they follow it as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, but if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. Verily it is the heart.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (25) and Muslim (1599). If the heart is focused then the hearing, sight, head, face and all the parts of the body will be focused, as will all the things that stem from them, even speech. Then he said: The focus that appears in the heart stems from awareness of Allaah and acknowledgement of His might, power and perfection. The one who knows more of Allaah will be more focused. People vary in their focus according to their knowledge of the One before Whom they are standing and their awareness of the attributes of Allaah that lead to more focus. Some focus because of their sense of being so close to the Lord and that He is aware of what is in their hearts and minds. That leads them to feel humble before Allaah and know that He is watching all their movements. And there are some who focus because of their awareness of His might, glory and greatness, which leads them to venerate Him and fear Him. And there are some who focue because of their awareness of His perfection and beauty, which leads them to be filled with love for Him and long to meet Him. And there are some who focus because they are aware of the severity of His wrath, vengeance and punishment, which leads them to fear Him. Allaah is the One Who takes care of those who are humble before Him, because He draws close to those who submit to Him, as He draws close to the one who addresses Him in prayer and lowers his face in the dust before Him when prostrating, and He draws near to those who come to His House to stand before Him and beseech Him as they stand in ‘Arafah. He draws close to them and boasts of them before the angels, and He draws near to His slaves who call upon Him and ask of Him and pray for forgiveness of their sins in the time before dawn. He answers their prayers and grants them what they ask for, and no better reward for the slave’s humbleness than the closeness of Allaah and His response to their prayers. End quote. Al-Dhill wa’l-Inkisaar li’l-‘Azeez al-Jabbaar (in Rasaa’il ibn Rajab, 1/290, 293). As for that which the questioner mentions about visualizing the Ka’bah when he prays, we do not know of any basis for that and it does not seem that this visualizing would help in attaining true focus (khushoo’) in prayer. How many of those who have been in the vicinity of the Ka’bah and seen it with their own eyes prayed as if they were praying in the marketplace, without any real focus. In the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah that is quoted above, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained what ihsaan is, and said that it means “to worship Allaah as if you can see Him”; he did not say, “as if you can see the Ka’bah.” And Allaah knows best."
326,What Is the Last Surah Revealed in the Quran?,Question What is the last Surah of the Quran to be revealed?,"Praise be to Allah.The last Surah of the Quran to be revealed was Surat al-Nasr (“When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah)” [al-Nasr 110:1 – interpretation of the meaning]). This is the view of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him). Muslim (3024) narrated that ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Utbah said: “Ibn `Abbas said to me, ‘Do you know the last Surah of the Quran that was revealed in full?’ I said, ‘Yes, “When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah)” [al-Nasr 110:1 – interpretation of the meaning]].’ He said, ‘You have spoken the truth.’” This is supported by the sahih report from ‘Umar and Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that this Surah was a sign that the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was approaching. Al-Bukhari (4970) narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: “‘'Umar used to make me sit with the elderly men who had fought in the Battle of Badr. Some of them felt it (did not like that) and said to 'Umar ‘Why do you bring in this boy to sit with us when we have sons like him?’ 'Umar said, ‘Because of what you know of his position (i.e. his religious knowledge.)’ One day 'Umar called me and made me sit in the gathering of those people; and I think that he called me just to show them (my religious knowledge). 'Umar then asked them (in my presence). ‘What do you say about the interpretation of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah).” [Al-Nasr 110:1]?’ Some of them said, ‘We are ordered to praise Allah and ask for His forgiveness when Allah's Help comes to us and we prevail (over our enemies).’ Some others kept quiet and did not say anything. On that, 'Umar asked me, ‘Do you say the same, O Ibn 'Abbas?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘What do you say then?’ I said, ‘That is the sign of the death of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which Allah informed him of. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): “When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah). And you see that the people enter Allah’s religion (Islam) in crowds. So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives” [Al-Nasr 110:1-3] At that 'Umar said, ‘I do not know anything about it other than what you have said.’” Al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the last Surah to be revealed was Bara-ah (al-Tawbah). Al-Bukhari (4329) and Muslim (1618) narrated that al-Bara ibn ‘Azib said: “The last Surah to be revealed was Bara-ah, and the last verse to be revealed was (interpretation of the meaning): ‘They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: “Allah directs (thus) about Al-Kalalah (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs)’ [Al-Nisa 4:176] `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The last Surah to be revealed was al-Maidah.” Ahmad (25588) narrated that Jubayr ibn Nufayr said: “I entered upon ‘Aishah and she said, ‘Do you read Surat al-Maidah?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘It is the last Surah to be revealed, so whatever you find in it of halal, accept it as halal, and whatever you find in it of haram, accept it as haram.’ I asked her about the attitude of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and she said, ‘The Quran .’” This hadith was classed as sahih by Shu’ayb al-Arnaut in Tahqeeq al-Musnad. There is no proven hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which states which was the last Surah of the Quran to be revealed. This is why the Companions differed and each of them said what his ijtihad led him to. Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The differing opinions may be reconciled by noting that each of them replied according to the knowledge that he had. This was quoted from him by al-Mubarakfuri in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. And Allah knows best."
327,He said to his wife “anti qaaliq (which sounds like taaliq = divorced)” as a joke,"Question A man was joking with his wife, and he said to her as he was joking: I am going to deprive you of inheritance because you are qaaliq (a word that sounds like taaliq, meaning divorced), but he did not intend divorce and he did not intend even to say the words “anti taaliq (you are divorced)”. But his wife told him that he had divorced her, based on the hadeeth, “Three words which if they are said in earnest, they are serious, and if they are said in jest, they are serious.” Is this true? Please note that he regretted it and repented from joking about such matters. What should he do if divorce has indeed taken place?.","Praise be to Allah. If a man says to his wife “anti qaaliq”, it does not count as divorce, as it is not one of the phrases that mean divorce either explicitly or implicitly. But if he intended divorce thereby, then it does count as a divorce according to some of the scholars. Al-Kharashi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel (4/48): If a man says to his wife: pour the water, or go in, or go out, or eat, or drink, or anything else that is not one of the phrases of divorce or a clear phrase of zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce), but he intends divorce thereby, then it is binding according to the well-known opinion, because these phrases are metaphors and he is bound by whatever he intended of one or more divorces. But if he did not intend divorce, then it does not count as such. End quote. The hadeeth “There are three matters in which seriousness is serious and joking is serious: marriage, divorce and taking back (one’s wife)” was narrated by Abu Dawood (2194), al-Tirmidhi (1184), Ibn Maajah (2039); classed as saheeh by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (3/424) and al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi (944). The hadeeth has to do with the explicit phrases of divorce. If the man says to his wife: Anti taaliq (you are divorced) intending it as a joke or to scare her, then divorce has taken place. But as for metaphors or implicit phrases which may be understood as intending divorce or otherwise, such as saying “ go to your family” or “you are free” or “ I have no need of you” or “ you are no longer under my care,” these do not count as divorce unless they were intended as such. See the answer to question number 114729. You should beware of using words of divorce whether in a serious or joking manner, because of the consequences that result from them. And Allaah knows best."
328,Working for a company that was established with a riba-based loan and is still borrowing money on the basis of riba,"Question What is the ruling on working for a company that was founded with a riba-based loan and until the present is still taking loans, and every time it pays off one loan, it takes out another for a larger amount… And via these loans it funds its projects and pays the salaries of its employees? Please note that the individual concerned was not aware of these loans, and he works for the company as a programmer, and has nothing to do with the finances at all; furthermore, the programs that he designs are not used in the financial affairs of the company. If it is not permissible for him to work for this company, can he continue to work there until he finds another job, or does he have to leave it immediately? With regard to the money that he has saved from his salary, is it halaal or is it to be regarded as haraam?","Praise be to Allah. If the projects that the company undertakes are permissible projects, and the programmer asked about does not directly deal with the finances of the company, as you said, then it is permissible for him to work with that company, but it is better for him to look for other work, because it is makrooh to work with those who deal with riba. The sin of riba is borne by the company and those who directly deal with riba or help with it, or approve of it. As for the salary of the programmer, he has received it in return for permissible work. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about an employee who works for a company that deals with banks and takes out riba-based loans from them, and gives the employees their salaries from those riba-based loans. He replied: Does this employee write the contracts between the company and the banks? Questioner: He does not write them; rather it is me, O Shaykh! (i.e., he is the employee about whom the question is being asked). Shaykh: Then you do not write down the riba-based contract, you do not witness it, and you do not take or give riba, so I do not see anything wrong with this, so long as the work you do for the company is sound (and free of any haraam element), in which case the burden of sin is borne by the company itself. If you do not go to the bank or sign any transaction with the bank, then there is no sin on you. This company – first of all – was not established for the purpose of dealing in riba, and it is not like the bank concerning which we would tell you not to take a job there. It was not established for the purpose of dealing in riba. Secondly, you are not dealing directly with the riba, by writing it down, witnessing it or offering any other service connected to it; your work is separate from the riba. End quote from al-Baab al-Maftooh (59/15). And Allah knows best."
329,Ruling on prepaid credit cards from al-Ahli Bank,Question What is the ruling on prepaid credit cards from al-Ahli Commercial Bank?.,"Praise be to Allah. It is permissible to deal with prepaid credit cards, because they are free from the haraam things found in other credit cards with which the customer borrows from the bank, such as the stipulation of a penalty in the event of late payment, or paying interest, and so on. See the answer to question no. 143719. But with prepaid credit cards, the customer is drawing from his own funds and is not borrowing from the bank."
330,The bank offered to freeze part of his account in return for interest,Question My husband has a current account in a foreign bank. His account is very active due to his work. Therefore the bank offered to freeze a part of his account in return for 40.000 Dirham monthly. Is this considered Riba (interest)? My husband does not believe that it is Riba. He believes that Riba – from his viewpoint- is exploiting people’s difficult circumstances (be it sickness or need) by overburdening them by Riba. He says: “the bank is not in need of my money”. What is the ruling in this case? If this is Riba then how shall I convince him of refusing it? Please bear in mind that he is an Alawi Muslim. He does not trust scholars’ opinions and he says that the Quran prohibited interested but not in such cases as his case. He also says that most of the fatawa given by scholars are personal and unconvincing.,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: Before we give advice to your husband with regard to riba, we think that it is essential for us to offer him advice on something that is more important, which is the ‘Alawi madhhab. The ‘Alawi madhhab has many beliefs that are contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims. Hence we hope that your husband will examine those beliefs and reject those that are contrary to Islam, and believe that which is indicated by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him). In the answer to question number 109264 we have given a brief description of the ‘Alawi sect; please refer to it. Secondly: Freezing the bank account in return for getting 40,000 dirhams is the essence of riba, because in fact this transaction is a loan with interest. It makes no difference whether the bank is in need or not. Every loan that brings benefit is riba according to scholarly consensus. What a loan means is taking money and paying it back; if there is an agreement that it will be returned with something extra, even if it is one dirham, this is undoubtedly riba. There is nothing in the Qur’aan or Sunnah to suggest that riba is only that which is taken from the needy, sick or desperate. Rather there are many types of riba, including loans with interest. There is also the riba of sales, such as exchanging gold for gold with an additional amount, or silver for silver with an additional amount, or date or dates with an additional amount. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are seventy-two types of riba, the least of which is equivalent to a man committing incest with his mother.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3537. And the Prophet (blessings and peace to Allaah be upon him) said: “A dirham of riba that a man consumed knowingly is worse before Allaah then thirty-six acts of zina.” Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 3375. This stern warning shakes the heart of every believing man and woman, and prevents him or her from falling into this grave sin. Allaah has threatened the one who consumes riba with war, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. 279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [al-Baqarah 2:278-279] Who would want that for himself, who is able for that?! Allaah tells us that riba erases blessing and leads to bad consequences. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah will destroy Riba and will give increase for Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allaah likes not the disbelievers, sinners. [al-Baqarah 2:276] The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah the upon him) told us that curses descend upon the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the two who witness it and the one who writes it down. Muslim (1598) narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same. What is the value of money if Allaah does not bless it and if curses descend upon its owner?! Hence we see many of those who consume riba losing their wealth without benefitting from it, because there is no blessing in it, as well as the feelings of worry, distress and anxiety that they feel. This is one of the effects of sin, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and longer lasting. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. A wise person must be content with that which is halaal and not to keep running after what is haraam, because he will never get anything from it except loss and doom. May Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows best."
331,Ruling on taking part and working in savings accounts,"Question I am working at the postal service, specifically in the administration of computers. The post service gives annual interest on saving accounts. According to the governmental system, the postal service gives the money to the National Bank of Investment (NIB). This bank does not deal but with the government in financing its projects. It gives other banks and governmental associations mortgages. Then the money returns to us with the interest added. The NIB then specifies the amount of interest then we add them on the saving accounts, and we have a share for ourselves of this. My role is to enter all the receipts of deposits and withdrawals of customers to the main computer. Then we add the interest in July of every year to the customers’ accounts. We also use the computers in order to make sure of every customer’s saving account. Am I considered kaatib Riba (the person who writes the interest)? Is the interest of the post office saving accounts halal or haram, knowing that we, Alhamdulillah, do not give mortgages? Also the savings are 90% of what is being spent on the service. Shall I leave my work, or ask to move to another section, or it is permissible to work as I am? .","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: It is haraam to deposit money in savings accounts, for two reasons: 1 – It is a contract that is based on adding a set percentage to the capital, whilst guaranteeing that the capital will remain intact. In fact it is an interest-based loan, and the scholars are unanimously agreed that every loan that brings a benefit is riba (usury). The lender here is the customer, and the borrower is the institution that provides these accounts. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Every loan in which it is stipulated that more should be paid back is haraam, with no difference of scholarly opinion. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They are unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay back more or give a gift, and he gives the loan on that basis, then this extra payment is riba. It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood forbade loans that bring benefits. (6/436). 2 – The Post office puts the money received into riba-based banks, and takes a set percentage for it, part of which it distributes as a reward to the depositors. This is another riba-based transaction that is done by the post office. The post office borrows money with riba in the first case, and it lends money with riba in the second case. Hence the one who examines these transactions will have no doubt that they are haraam, and it is haraam to work in them whether as a scribe or witness or helping with it in any way. In Mawsoo’at Fataawa al-Azhar, there is a question addressed to the former Shaykh of al-Azhar, Jaad al-Haqq ‘Ali Jaad al-Haqq (may Allaah have mercy on him) about the interest that is paid by banks or companies on the money that is deposited or invested with them – is this interest regarded as riba (usury) or not? After mentioning the texts which forbid riba, he said: Based on these texts and others in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, all types and forms of riba are forbidden, whether it is additional to the amount that was originally lent, or an additional amount charged when payment is delayed, or this additional amount is stipulated in the contract along with a guarantee that the capital will remain intact. As that is the case, then the interest asked about, which is mentioned in the contract when depositing money in the bank, and in savings funds at the post office and banks, and in investment certificates which stipulate a specific return on the capital – the deposit in such cases is a loan with interest, and comes under the heading of riba al-fadl or riba al-ziyaadah, as the fuqaha’ call it. It is haraam in Islam, based on the general meaning of the verses in the Holy Qur’aan and the texts of the Sunnah, and the consensus of the Muslims. It is not permissible for a Muslim to deal in it or lend such loans, because he is responsible before Allaah for his wealth, from where he acquires it and on what he spends it, as it says in the hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi: “A person’s feet will not move on the Day of Resurrection until he is asked about his life and how he spent it, about his actions and what he did, and about his wealth, from where he acquired it and on what he spent it, and about his body, how he used it.” And Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows best. End quote. Secondly: Working in “entering all the receipts of deposits and withdrawals of customers to the main computer” comes under the heading of writing down riba. Muslim (1598) narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same. What you must do is repent to Allaah, and hasten to give up this work, and move to another department that is far away from riba, or leave the work altogether, so as to get away from this grave major sin. Remember that if a person gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it, and that He will provide for the one who fears Him, and He will bless him and provide for him from sources he could never imagine. “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). 3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3] May Allaah help us and you to do that which is good, follow true guidance and attain success. And Allaah knows best."
332,Can the husband’s cheating be justified by blaming his wife for refusing intimacy with him?,"Question If a husband cheats on his wife, can he blame his wife for his sin or be partially blamed? Not to say that they did not have intercourse for months or so, but refrained from sexual intimacy for a much shorter time (such as a week or more weeks, past the time the menstrual time has ended and intimacy is possible but has not occurred for whatever reason). Can he justify his actions by saying that she will get the sin because he did not fulfill his desires? Can at any point the wife be blamed, if it is a long period of time since sexual intimacy?","Praise be to Allah. One of the worst things that the one who has been disobedient towards Allah can do is trying to justify his sin by referring to something that is worse than it and trying to justify his transgression of the sacred limits by making up excuses when he knows that the truth of the matter is that he was overcome by desires, by his nafs (self) that prompts him to do evil, lust that he could not control and a conscious decision to commit this action. And he does this at the time when what the one who has committed an action that is contrary to Islam should do is hasten to admit his shortcomings and ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, loves for His slave who has slipped up and fallen into the mire of immoral actions to hasten to regret it and turn to his Lord, may He be glorified, and admit what he has done, then ask Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to forgive him, help to do righteous deeds and protect him from evil deeds. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him, (in Islam), before the torment comes upon you, then you will not be helped” [az-Zumar 39:54] “And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse etc.) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; - and none can forgive sins but Allah - And do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:135]. We may ponder the story of our father Adam (peace be upon him) and how he hastened to admit his sin and take responsibility for what he had done and for his shortcomings. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “They said: ""Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers” [al-A ‘raaf 7:23]. So Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, rewarded him by accepting his repentance and forgiving him, by His grace. Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then Adam received from his Lord Words . And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:37]. This is a good example for all of us; we should remember the grace and kindness of Allah, and we should put our trust in Him acknowledging our sins and our wrongdoing towards ourselves, and we should hasten to repent as Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad SAW) and begged Allahs Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful” [an-Nisa’ 4:64]. As for the accursed Iblees, he persisted in his disobedience and did not admit his shortcomings; rather he tried to pin the blame on others and he argued about his reasons for going against the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): “(Allah) said: ‘What prevented you (O Iblees) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you?’ Iblees said: ‘I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.’ (Allah) said: ‘(O Iblees) get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.’” [al-A‘raaf 7:12-13]. On the other hand: It is not permissible for the wife to try to justify her disobedience by forsaking her husband’s bed with made-up excuses. Marital intimacy is a confirmed right and there is a stern warning against wives who fall short in that regard. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she does not come to him, and he goes to sleep angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3237) and Muslim (1436). This is a stern warning to every wife who refuses to share her husband’s bed for any reason other than a legitimate shar‘i excuse such as menses, nifaas (postpartum bleeding) or sickness. If she refuses for several weeks, then the sin is greater and more abhorrent, and she is required to repent and seek forgiveness, and also ask her husband to forgive her, so as to turn over a new leaf and to create a calm and happy family atmosphere in the home, filled with tranquillity, respect and fulfilment of rights and duties. For more information, please see fatwa no. 99756 And Allah knows best."
333,Is Learning Fiqh of Financial Transactions Essential?,"Question Is learning the fiqh of buying and selling and financial transactions obligatory (fard ‘ayn – an individual obligation) for everyone who engages in buying and selling, such as a pharmacist and representatives of pharmaceutical companies?","Praise be to Allah.If the Muslim understands that the purpose and aim of his being created in this world is to adhere to the laws of Allah, and to worship Allah by doing so, then he will also understand that it is essential for him to learn the rulings of Allah’s laws and learn what his duties are. That is because what is needed in order to do what is obligatory is also obligatory. It says in the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim .” (Narrated by Ibn Majah (224) and classed as hasan because of its many isnads and corroborating reports by al-Mazzi, al-Zarkashi, al-Suyuti, al-Sakhaawi, al-Dhahabi, al-Manawi, and al-Zarqani. It is also in Sahih Ibn Majah by al-Albani.) The scholars have stated that the meaning of this hadith is sahih. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “But its meaning is sahih in their opinion, even though they differed somewhat concerning it."" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm 1/53) Al-Nawawi said something similar in al-Mathurat (p. 287), as did Ibn al-Qayyim in Miftah Dar al-Sa’adah (1/480). Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr also said: “The scholars are unanimously agreed that acquiring some types of knowledge is an individual obligation, which each person must learn for himself, and acquiring other types of knowledge is a communal obligation – if some people acquire it then the obligation of others is waived."" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi 1/56) The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have described the knowledge which must be learned on an individual basis, and they have spoken of the amount of knowledge which each Muslim must acquire. They said that this includes learning the rulings on selling for those who engage in trade, so that they will not do anything haram or fall into riba (usury) without realizing. There are reports from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) which support that. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “No one should sell in our marketplace except those who have knowledge of Islam.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 487, who said: it is hasan gharib. It was also classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi.) ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever engages in trade before learning will fall into riba, then fall into riba.” (Mughni al-Muhtaj 2/22) Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “What all people must learn is that which they cannot afford to be ignorant of such as bearing witness verbally and believing in the heart that Allah is One and has no partner or associate, and that His names and attributes are eternal; He has no beginning and no end, and He has risen over the Throne. He should bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, and that all people will be resurrected after death to be rewarded or punished for their deeds, and that the Quran is the Word of Allah, and that what is in it is true. He should affirm that the five daily prayers are obligatory, and he must know what is essential for the performance of the prayer, such as purification and other rulings. He should affirm that fasting Ramadan is obligatory, and he must know what invalidates the fast and what is essential for the completion of the fast. If he has enough wealth and is physically able to perform Hajj, he must know what zakah is due on, and when it becomes due, and on how much it is due. He must perform Hajj once in his life if he has the means. And there are things that he must know in general and he has no excuse for not knowing: such as the fact that zina and riba are forbidden, as are alcohol, pork, eating dead meat and all impure things, embezzling, bearing false witness, consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, all kinds of wrongdoing and oppression, marrying one’s mother or sister or any of those who are mentioned with them, and killing a believer unlawfully. And he must know all other things that are mentioned in the Book and that the ummah is agreed upon."" (Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm 1/57) It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (30/293): “Ibn ‘Abidin said, quoting from al-‘Allami: It is obligatory for every accountable person, male or female , after learning about religion and guidance, to learn about wudu, ghusl, prayer, fasting, zakah for those who have the nisab (minimum threshold of wealth) and Hajj for those for whom it is obligatory. Merchants must also learn the rulings on trade, so that they can avoid doubtful and makruh things in their transactions ; the same applies to those who follow professions. Everyone who works with something must learn the rulings concerning it so that he can avoid what is haram. Al-Nawawi said: ""As for selling, marriage and the like – which are not obligatory per se – it is haram to engage in them until one has learned their conditions.” Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If a Muslim is a merchant and riba is widespread in the land, he must learn about the prohibition on riba. This is knowledge which is an individual obligation, i.e., knowledge of how to do what is required."" (Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din 1/33) ‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq said to Ibn al-Mubarak: “What can the believer do with knowledge except seeking it? What is he obliged to learn? He said: “He cannot afford to do anything without knowledge, and he cannot avoid asking.” (Narrated by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in Jami’ Bayan al-‘Ilm (1/56) Al-Ghazali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Every person in his daily life is bound to face new issues with regard to his worship and dealings with others. So he must ask about everything, whatever new issues he encounters, and he must hasten to find out about what he expects to face before he faces it.” (Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din, 1/34) Our advice to those who work in trade and buying and selling is to read some of the books that have been written about the fiqh of transactions, such as al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan, and Ma la Yas’u al-Tajir Jahlulu by Prof. ‘Abd-Allah al-Muslim and Salah al-Sawi.

334,Elderly woman uncovering her face before non-mahrams,Question Is it permissible for an elderly woman to uncover her face before men who are not her mahrams?.,"Praise be to Allah. Yes, Allaah has permitted elderly women to uncover their faces before non-mahram men, but that is subject to the condition that they do not uncover anything of their adornment that may be a cause of fitnah, so they should not wear attractive or fancy clothes or put any cosmetics on their faces to beautify them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allaah is All‑Hearer, All‑Knower” [al-Noor 24:60]. Abu Bakr al-Jassaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the words of Allaah, “women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock” [al-Noor 24:60], Ibn Mas’ood and Mujaahid said: Women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock are those who do not want it, and their outer garments are their jilbabs. Then he said: There is no dispute that the hair of an elderly woman is ‘awrah and it is not permissible for a non-mahram to look at it, as is the case with the hair of a young woman. If she prays with her head uncovered, then like a young woman (in the same situation), her prayer is invalid. So it cannot be that the meaning is that she may take off her head covering in the presence of a non-mahram man. Rather it is permitted for an elderly woman to take off her outer garment in the presence of men, after she has covered her head, and it is permitted for her to uncover her face and hands, because she is not desirable. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them” [al-Noor 24:60]. So He has permitted her to take off her jilbab, but He says that refraining by not taking off her garment before men is better for her. End quote. Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (3/485). Ibn al-‘Arabi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This is mentioned only for women past childbearing age, in exclusion to others, because they are no longer desirable, but refraining by keeping the full covering is better than doing that which is permitted to them, namely taking off their outer garments. End quote. Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (3/419). Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (p. 670): Women who are past childbearing are those who no longer have any interest in intimacy and desire, “women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock” [al-Noor 24:60], i.e., they do not hope to get married and they are not wanted in marriage, because they have grown old and are not desirable. “it is no sin on them” i.e., there is no blame on them, “if they discard their (outer) clothing” i.e., outer garments such as the khimaar and so on, concerning which Allaah says “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” [al-Noor 24:31]. It is permissible for these women to uncover their faces, because there is no fear of temptation. And because allowing them to take off their outer garment may be taken as meaning that they are allowed to adorn themselves, the matter is clarified by the words: “in such a way as not to show their adornment” i.e., without showing their adornment to people, by beautifying the outer garment or striking their ground with their feet so as to let people know about their hidden adornments, because the mere fact that a female is wearing adornments, even if she covers them, and even if she is not desirable, is a cause of fitnah which causes the one who looks at it to fall into sin. “But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them” [al-Noor 24:60]. End quote. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for a woman of advanced years, such as 70 or 90 years old, to uncover her face before her non-mahram relatives? He replied: Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allaah is All‑Hearer, All‑Knower” [al-Noor 24:60]. Women past childbearing are elderly women who are not desired in marriage and who do not put on adornment. There is no sin on them if they uncover their faces before non-mahrams, but for them to observe hijab is better and is more on the safe side, because Allaah says “But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them” [al-Noor 24:60]. And in some cases seeing them may cause fitnah because of their beautiful appearance even if they are old and not wearing adornment. But if they are wearing adornment, it is not permissible for them to refrain from observing hijab. Adornment includes beautifying the face with kohl and the like. And Allaah is the source of strength. End quote. Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (1/424). And Allaah knows best."
335,Ruling on mentioning the gender of the deceased to the members of the congregation before offering the funeral prayer,"Question What is the ruling on stating the gender of the deceased, whether male or female, when offering the funeral prayer for him or her?.","Praise be to Allah. There is nothing wrong with stating whether the deceased was male or female when he or she is brought forward for the funeral prayer, if the members of the congregation did not know that, so that they may offer du’aa’ in the masculine if he was male and in the feminine if she was female, but if that is not done, it does not matter either, and the worshippers who do not know about this deceased person may intend to offer the prayer for the one who is there before them, and the funeral prayer will be valid whether they say it in the masculine (“O Allaah forgive him”), meaning this one who is present before us, or in the feminine (“O Allaah forgive her”), meaning this funeral bier that is before us [because the Arabic word al-haadir, meaning the one who is present, is masculine, and the word janaazah, meaning funeral bier, is feminine].

336,Can he make use of his brother’s gym membership card and attend instead of him on some days?,"Question My brother pays money for gym every month and he can workout in that gym everyday, but he only works-out three times a week every other day. He has a membership card which he can lend to me; if I take that opportunity and workout the remaining days is that theft of the service? Buying a ticket and then giving it your brother is not stealing, so how can the scenario above be stealing?","Praise be to Allah. The reality of membership of a gym or health club is that it is a rental contract for use of the facilities. In the case of a rental contract, it is permissible for the renter to make use of the facilities himself or allow someone else to do so. Al-Bahooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The renter may make use of the facilities himself or allow someone else to do so, by lending or otherwise, because he has access to the facilities by virtue of the contract. So he may make use of them himself, or allow someone else to do so. End quote from Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (4/16) Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible for the renter to rent out the rented item to someone who takes his place, in return for a similar rent or more. End quote. Al-Ikhtiyaaraat (152) But if the owner has stipulated that only the renter may make use of the rented item or facility, and that such use is not transferable, then in this case he must abide by this condition. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 1, 15/88): If a person rents something, he may rent it out in turn to another person, for the same amount as he rented it, or for more or less than that, and for the same time period as agreed upon, to someone who will make use of it as he would, or less than that, but not more than that, so as to avoid harm, because he has the right to make use of the rented item, so it is permissible for him to make use of it himself or allow another person to do so. That is unless the owner has stipulated that he should not rent it out to others or that he should not rent it out to people who practice specific professions or crafts, in which case both parties are bound by the conditions they have stipulated. End quote. See: al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah by Shaykh al-Islam (152); ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (10/71) by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him). Based on that, if the membership of the gym is a personal membership and it is not allowed for anyone other than the cardholder to go to this gym and make use of the facilities, then you must abide by this condition, and it is not permissible in this case for you to use this membership card. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” What has been said regarding gym membership cards may also be said concerning tickets. If it is stipulated that the ticket may only be used by the purchaser, it is not permissible for him to give it to someone else to use it. If no such condition has been stipulated, it is permissible for him to use it himself or let someone else use it. And Allah knows best."
337,What is the wisdom behind Allah asking the angels about the condition of His slaves when He knows more about them than they do?,"Question What can we learn from some texts in which it says that Allah asks His slaves, such as His asking Jibreel what they [people] are hoping for?","Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (6408) and Muslim (2689) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, has angels who travel about, with no other job but to seek out gatherings of dhikr. When they find a gathering in which Allah is remembered, they sit with them and encircle them with their wings, until they fill the space between earth and the first heaven. When they (the people) part, they (the angels) ascend to heaven and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, asks them, although He knows best: ‘From where have you come?’ They say: ‘We have come from some of Your slaves on earth, who were glorifying You, magnifying You, proclaiming Your Oneness, praising You and asking of You.’ He says: ‘What are they asking of Me?’ They say: ‘They are asking You for Your Paradise.’ He says: ‘Have they seen My Paradise?’ They say: ‘No, O Lord.’ He says: ‘So how about if they saw My Paradise?’ They say: ‘And they are seeking Your protection.’ He says: ‘From what are they seeking My protection?’ They say: ‘From Your Fire, O Lord.’ He says: ‘Have they seen My Fire?’ They say: ‘No, O Lord.’ He says: ‘So how about if they saw My Fire?’ They say: ‘And they are asking You for forgiveness.’ He says: ‘I have forgiven them, and given them what they asked for, and granted them protection from that from which they sought My protection.’ They say: ‘Lord, among them is So and so, a sinner who was merely passing by, then he sat with them.’ He says: ‘Him too I have forgiven. They are people whose companion cannot be doomed.’” According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari: “[Allah] says: ‘Have they seen Me?’ They say: ‘No, by Allah, they have not seen You.’ He says: ‘So how about if they saw Me?’ They say: ‘If they saw You, they would strive harder in worshipping You, and they would strive harder in lauding and praising You, and strive harder in glorifying You.’” Muslim (1348) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no day when Allah ransoms more people from the Fire than the day of ‘Arafah. He draws near then He boasts about them to the angels and says, ‘What do these people want?’” According to another report: “These are My slaves who have come unkempt and dusty from from every distant pass, hoping for My mercy and fearing My punishment, when they have not seen Me, so how about if they saw Me?” It was narrated by ‘Abd ar-Razzaaq (8830) and classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘ (1360). Among the reasons why Allah, may He be exalted, asks His angels about the condition of His slaves, as in this and similar hadiths, are the following, and Allah knows best: Because Allah, may He be glorified, wants to highlight His grace to them and His mercy and forgiveness, and how He meets their needs as a reward for their righteous deeds and their seeking their Lord’s bounty in a proper manner, so that people might come to know Allah, may He be exalted, by His names and attributes, and by what He bestows upon His righteous slaves. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadith quoted above about the virtue of standing in ‘Arafah: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says: “What do these people want?” that is, what do they seek by coming to this place? Because He wants to bestow His mercy and forgiveness upon them, and to give them what they ask for. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen (23/26). Because He wants to highlight the virtue of these obedient and righteous people, as they put their hope in Him and fear Him without having seen Him. Because Allah, may He be exalted, wants to explain to His angels the reason why He boasts about them and honours them, as He affirms that His slaves have come unkempt and dusty, hoping for His reward and seeking His mercy. This is also explained in the words, “He says: ‘So how about if they saw Me?’…” Thus the angels attest to these people’s obedience and righteousness even though they have not seen Allah, which is in contrast to the attitude of Iblees, who was arrogant and refused to obey. This method of establishing facts by means of questions and answers is also used with regard to the disbeliever, but in the case of the believer it serves to highlight his honour and the blessing and favour that Allah has bestowed upon him, whereas in the case of the disbeliever it serves to rebuke and humiliate him, and to establish proof against him, as it says in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah about the reckoning of the disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection: “Allah will meet His slave and will say: ‘O So and so, did I not honour you, make you a chief, give you a spouse and subjugate horses and camels to you, and give you the opportunity to be a leader?’ He will say: ‘Yes.’ He will say: ‘Did you think that you would meet Me?’ He will say: ‘No.’ He will say: T’hen I will forget you as you forgot Me’…” Narrated by Muslim (2968). It contains an implicit answer to the question asked by the angels when they said: “Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?” [al-Baqarah 2:30]. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that a questioner may ask his question even when he has better knowledge of the answer than the one whom he is asking, so as to demonstrate his care for the one whom he is asking, and to highlight the latter’s virtue and high status. It was said that with regard to Allah’s asking the angels about the people of dhikr [those who remember Him], that was a reference to their having asked, “Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?”. It is as if it were being said to them: Look at they do of glorifying and sanctifying Allah, despite what overwhelms them of whims and desires and the whispers of the Shaytaan, and how they resist that and surpass you in glorifying and sanctifying Allah. It was said that from this hadith it may be understood that the dhikr of the sons of Adam is more sublime and nobler than the dhikr of the angels, because the dhikr of the humans occurs despite the fact that they are preoccupied with so many issues and distractions, and because their dhikr is remembrance of Allah without having seen Him, in contrast to the angels with regard to all of that.

338,We should not stop doing what is prescribed for fear of showing off,"Question Sometimes I want to do a righteous deed such as praying or reading Qur’aan, then someone comes in and I stop reading in the Mushaf or I don’t start praying, or I shorten my prayer if I have started it. Is it correct to do this?","Praise be to Allah. Ibn Muflih said: “We should not stop doing what is prescribed in Islam for fear of showing off.” One of the things that may happen to a person is that he wants to do an act of worship, but something happens that makes him stop doing it for fear that he may be showing off in some way. He should not pay attention to that. We should do what Allaah has commanded and encouraged us to do, and seek the help of Allaah, and put our trust in Him that He will help us to do the action in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah. Shaykh Muhiy al-Deen al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: We should not stop remembering Allaah (dhikr) with our tongues as well as in our hearts for fear that people may think that we are showing off; rather we should remember Allaah with both, seeking the pleasure of Allaah thereby. He mentioned what al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: that not doing something because of people was (a form of) showing off, and doing something because of people was (a form of) shirk. He said: if we start to pay attention to people and try to protect ourselves from their thinking badly of us, that would stop us from doing a lot of good deeds. Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi said: As for not doing an act of worship for fear of showing off, if the motive for doing that act of worship is something other than religious commitment, then he should refrain from doing it, because it is a sin. But if the motive for doing it is religious commitment and he does it sincerely for the sake of Allaah, then he should not refrain from doing it, because the motive is religious commitment. Similarly, if he refrains from doing a righteous deed for fear that he will be called a show-off, he should not do that (refrain from that deed) because this is one of the traps of the Shaytaan. Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said: if the Shaytaan comes to you whilst you are praying and says, “you are showing off,” then make your prayer longer. With regard to the report that one of the salaf stopped praying for fear of showing off, this is to be interpreted as meaning that they felt as if they were showing off, so they gave up. This is as he said. For example, al-A’mash said, “I was with Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i and he was reading Qur’aan. A man asked permission to enter and he covered the Mus-haf and said, ‘He should not think that I read it all the time.’ If we should not stop doing acts of worship for fear of showing off, then it is more appropriate that we should not refrain from doing them for fear of the self-admiration that may come after doing them. We have discussed above the issue of self-admiration before the chapters on enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. We mentioned before the chapter on clothing the issue of visiting the ruler in order to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and we quoted the opinion of Dawood al-Taa’i who said, ‘I fear that he may be punished by the whip.’ It was said to him, ‘He can bear that.’ He said, ‘I fear that he may be executed by the sword.’ It was said to him, ‘He can bear that.’ Then he said, ‘I fear that he may be afflicted by the hidden disease’, i.e., self-admiration."
339,Will there be pregnancy and childbirth in Paradise?,Question We know that there will be wives in Paradise; will there be any pregnancy and childbirth?,"Praise be to Allah. Some of the scholars are of the view that if a person wishes to have a child in Paradise, Allah will fulfil that wish for him. They quoted as evidence for that the report narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2563) in his Sunan from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 6649 What is meant is that the pregnancy will occur and the child will be born and will grow to the age of perfection, which is thirty years, as the person wishes, i.e., the child will be male or female and so on, in accordance with the person’s wishes. This is the view of many of the scholars. Some of the scholars said that in Paradise there will be intercourse but there will be no children. This view was narrated from Tawoos, Muhaajid and Ibraaheem an-Nakha‘i. Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from Abu Razeen al-‘Uqayli that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will not have children there.” The hadeeth referred to by al-Bukhaari was narrated by Imam Ahmad (15773) from Abu Razeen al-‘Uqayli (may Allah be pleased with him) in a lengthy hadeeth in which it says “The righteous women will be for the righteous man, you will enjoy them as you enjoyed them in this world, and they will enjoy you, but you will not produce children.” Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It has the dignity and light of Prophethood which suggests that it is saheeh. However it was classed as da‘eef by al-Albaani in Zalaal al-Jannah, and Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot said: Its isnaad is da‘eef and is a series of unknown narrators. The hadeeth clearly states that there will be no childbirth, but there is a difference of opinion as to its soundness. With regard to the hadeeth of Abu Sa‘eed (may Allah be pleased with him), “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes”, it was noted that its soundness is subject to further discussion. Hence Ibn al-Qayyim said concerning it: Its isnaad meets the conditions of soundness, but it is ghareeb jiddan. Haadi al-Arwaah, p. 213 And he said: With regard to this hadeeth of Abu Saeed al-Khudri, the best of its isnaads is the isnaad of at-Tirmidhi, who determined that it is ghareeb and that it is only known from the hadeeth of Abu’s-Siddeeq an-Naaji, and the wording of the hadeeth is not sound. End quote. Imam Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning the hadeeth of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “If the believer wishes for a child in Paradise, the pregnancy, birth and growth will occur within an hour, as he wishes”: But he will not wish. What is meant by the words of Ishaaq is that the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “If the believer wishes …” are hypothetical )i.e., if the believer were to wish, but in fact he will not wish). Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned a number of reasons why it is most likely that there will be no childbirth in Paradise, such as the following: 1.The hadeeth of Ibn Razeen 2.The words of Allah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “Therein they shall have Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives)” [an-Nisa’ 4:57]. They are the ones who have been purified from menses, nifaas (postpartum bleeding) and so on. It was narrated that Mujaahid said: Purified from menses, stools, urine, sputum, spitting, maniy and childbirth. 3.Allah, may He be glorified, made pregnancy and childbirth along with menses and maniy; if women were to become pregnant in Paradise, menses and other discharges would not cease for them. 4.It is proven in as-Saheeh that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There will remain in Paradise surplus space, and Allah will create a creation for it and cause them to inhabit it (the surplus space).” Narrated by Muslim, 5085. If there were to be childbirth in Paradise, then this surplus space would be for those who would be born there, and they would be more entitled to it than others. 5.Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We join their offspring” [at-Toor 52:21]. Here He tells us that He will honour them by joining to them their offspring that they had in this world. If they were to have offspring in Paradise, Allah would have referred to them as He referred to their worldly offspring, because they would be delighted with them (the hypothetical offspring in Paradise) as they were delighted with their children in this world (i.e., the fact that He mentioned only the worldly offspring indicates that there will be no offspring in Paradise). 6.Either we say that there will ongoing procreation in Paradise or that it will continue until some point, then cease. But both ideas are impossible, because the former implies endless birth of new individuals, whilst the latter implies the end of one of the pleasures of the people of Paradise, and that is impossible. And we cannot say that there will be procreation and people will die to be succeeded by others, because there is no death there. 7.People will not grow in Paradise as they did in this world, so the children of its people will not grow and become bigger, and the men will not grow. Rather these children will remain small and will not change, and the adults will be thirty-three years old and will not change either. If there were any childbirth in Paradise, then the child would have to grow until it became an adult. It is well known that children who die will reach the age of thirty-three without growing. Then he said: Paradise is not the realm of procreation; rather it is the place of eternal abode and those who are in it will never die and be replaced by their offspring. End quote.

340,There is no evidence that du’aa’ made when seeing the Ka’bah is answered,Question Someone said that supplication made at the first sighting of the Kaaba is always granted. Is there any truth to this?,"Praise be to Allah.This is not true; there has to be evidence (daleel) for this to be true, because acts of worship should only be based on evidence. And that evidence must be saheeh in and of itself and it should be clear and unambiguous. And Allaah knows best."
341,Conditions of Wali (Guardian) in Islam,"Question What exactly constitutes a guardian, as is needed in the marriage ceremony. I am a female Muslim, and I want to know if my older brother is acceptable for this role.","Praise be to Allah.Pillars of marriage in Islam There are three pillars or conditions for the marriage contract in Islam: Both parties should be free of any obstacles that might prevent the marriage from being valid, such as their being mahrams of one another (i.e., close relatives who are permanently forbidden to marry), whether this relationship is through blood ties or through breastfeeding etc., or where the man is a non-Muslim and the woman is a Muslim, and so on. There should be an offer or proposal (ijab) from the wali or the person who is acting in his place, who should say to the groom “I marry so-and-so to you” or similar words. There should be an expression of acceptance (qabul) on the part of the groom or whoever is acting in his place, who should say, “I accept,” or similar words. Conditions of marriage in Islam The conditions of a proper marriage contract are as follows: Both the bride and groom should be clearly identified, whether by stating their names or describing them, etc. Both the bride and groom should be pleased with one another, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No previously-married woman (widow or divorcee) may be married until she has been asked about her wishes (i.e., she should state clearly her wishes), and no virgin should be married until her permission has been asked (i.e., until she has agreed either in words or by remaining silent).” They asked, “O Messenger of Allah, how is her permission given (because she will feel very shy)?” He said: “By her silence.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4741) The one who does the contract on the woman’s behalf should be her wali, as Allah addressed the walis with regard to marriage (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry those among you who are single…” [al-Nur 24:32] and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who marries without the permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1021 and others; it is a sound hadith) The marriage contract must be witnessed , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage contract except with a wali and two witnesses.” (Reported by al-Tabarani; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7558) Conditions of the wali The conditions of the wali are as follows: He should be of sound mind He should be an adult He should be free (not a slave) He should be of the same religion as the bride. A non-Muslim cannot be the wali of a Muslim , male or female, and a Muslim cannot be the wali of a kafir, male or female, but a non-Muslim can be the wali of a non-Muslim woman for marriage purposes, even if they are of different religions. An apostate (one who has left Islam) cannot be a wali for anybody. He should be of good character (‘adalah – includes piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), as opposed to being corrupt. This is a condition laid down by some scholars, although some of them regard the outward appearance of good character as being sufficient, and some say that it is enough if he is judged as being able to pay proper attention to the interests of the woman for whom he is acting as wali in the matter of her marriage. He should be male, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman may conduct the marriage contract of another woman, and no woman can conduct the marriage contract on behalf of her own self, because the zaniyah (fornicatress, adulteress) is the one who arranges things on her own behalf.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 1782; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7298) He should be wise and mature, which means being able to understand matters of compatibility and the interests of marriage. Order of who can take the role of the wali The jurists put possible walis in a certain order, and a wali who is more closely-related should not be ignored unless there is no such person or the relatives do not meet the specified conditions. A woman’s wali is her father, then whoever her father may have appointed before his death, then her paternal grandfather or great-grandfather, then her son, then his sons or grandsons, then her brother through both parents (full brother), then her brother through her father, then the sons of her brother through both parents, then the sons of her brother through her father, then her uncle (her father’s brother through both parents), then her father’s brother through the father, then the sons of her father’s brother though both parents, then the sons of her father’s brother through the father, then whoever is more closely related, and so on – as is the case with inheritance. The Muslim leader (or his deputy, such as a judge) is the wali for any woman who does not have a wali of her own. And Allah knows best."
342,The company is asking the contract holder to settle the bill,"Question A person has used my name, by my permission, to open a mobile phone contract for himself. This person does not pay the installments he should pay to the company, although he did not use this line. Is this haram? Am I responsible for this?.","Praise be to Allah. Custom dictates that the person whose name is written on the contract papers is the contract holder, and if that is the case then you are the contract holdr and you must fulfil the contract, because Allaah has enjoined fulfilment of contracts. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations” [al-Maa'idah 5:1]. So you have to pay off to this company with which you made a contract the money that becomes due as the result of this contract. It is not permissible for you to try to evade that. Then if you allowed this person to benefit from it on the basis that he would pay the instalments, you can ask him for these instalments yourself. And Allaah knows best."
343,How should we respond when the People of the Book greet us with salaam?,"Question What is the proper way of greeting a non-muslim (5%'er,FOI,or Christian)when they greet you with the correct Salam's.","Praise be to Allah.If the Muslim realizes that the kaafir has said to him al-saam alaykum, which means may death be upon you, he should respond in kind by saying wa alaykum (and also upon you). If he realizes beyond a doubt that he has greeted him with the greeting of Islam (al-salaamu alaykum), Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: if the listener realized that the Dhimmi [Jew or Christian] has said salaam alaykum and he is sure of that, should he say wa alayk al-salaam or just wa alayk? According to the evidence and principles of shareeah, he should say wa alayk al-salaam, because this is more fair, and Allaah commands us to be just and to treat others well. (Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 1/425, 426). Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih ibn Uthaymeen (may Allaah preserve him) said: These people who have come to us from the east and the west and are not Muslims, it is not permissible for us to initiate the greeting of salaam with them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Do not initiate the greeting of salaam with the Jews and Christians. (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). If they greet us, then we can respond in a manner similar to that in which they greet us, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally [al-Nisaa 4:86]. When they greet us with the greeting of Islam al-salaamu alaykum either of the following two cases applies: Either they pronounce the laam (l-sound) clearly, and say al-salaam alaykum (peace be upon you), so we may say wa alaykum al-salaam or wa alaykum Or they do not pronounce the laam clearly, and so they say al-saamu alaykum (death be upon you), so we should say wa alaykum only. This is because the Jews used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and greet him by saying al-saam alaykum, without pronouncing the laam. Al-saam means death; i.e., they were praying against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), praying that he would die. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to say to them wa alaykum. Thus, if they say al-saam alaykum, we should reply, wa alaykum, which means: and the same to you, may death be upon you. This is what is indicated by the Sunnah. But if we initiate the greeting of salaam with them, our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to do this. (Majmoo Fataawaa Ibn Uthaymeen, 2/97, 98). And Allaah knows best. For more information, see Question # 6583."
344,His friend curses a great deal,"Question I have a friend who curses a great deal, and his justification is that our noble Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… curse them [a certain type of woman] because they are cursed.” Allah is my witness that I have advised him, but to no avail. What is your advice to him?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Cursing falls into two categories: 1 – Cursing the kuffaar and sinners in general terms. This is permissible as is indicated by the texts of the Quran and Sunnah. 2 – Cursing an individual kaafir or evildoer concerning whom there is no text that speaks of cursing him. There is a difference of opinion concerning this among the scholars, but the correct view is that it is not allowed. See question no. 36674. Secondly: Cursing a great deal is criticized, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer is not a slanderer, one who curses a great deal, one who indulges in obscenity or who in engages in foul talk.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1977); classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. Al-Tirmidhi (2019) also narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer is not one who curses a great deal.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that cursing a great deal is one of the causes of entering the Fire, as al-Bukhaari (304) and Muslim (80) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O women, give in charity and pray a great deal for forgiveness, for I have seen that you are the majority of the people of Hell.” A wise woman among them said: Why is it, O Messenger of Allah, that we are the majority of the people of Hell? He said: “You curse a great deal and are ungrateful (takfurna) to your husbands … And Muslim (2599) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It was said: O Messenger of Allah, pray against the mushrikeen. He said: “I was not sent to curse, rather I was sent as a mercy.” And Muslim (2597) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not appropriate for a sincere believer to be given to cursing.” And Muslim (2598) narrated that Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Those who curse a great deal will not be witnesses or intercessors on the Day of Resurrection.” If the matter is as described in these ahaadeeth, then how can a Muslim accept this status for himself and accept to miss out on the status of the sincere believer, the witness and the intercessor on the Day of Resurrection? Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: It is not appropriate for the sincere believer to be given to cursing or for those who are given to cursing to be witnesses or intercessors on the Day of Resurrection. This is a rebuke that discourages cursing and a warning that the one who has this characteristic does not possess these beautiful attributes, for cursing is a kind of du’aa’ in which one prays that someone will be cast far away from the mercy of Allah, and praying for such a thing is not the attitude of the believers whom Allah has described as merciful to one another and as cooperating in righteousness and piety, and has made them like a structure, parts of which support other parts, and like a single body. The believer likes for his brother what he likes for himself. If a man prays that his brother be cursed, which means asking that he be cast far away from the mercy of Allah, this is the ultimate in severing ties and turning one’s back on another, and this is the worst that the Muslim wishes for the kaafir, and prays against him. Hence it says in the saheeh hadeeth: “Cursing a believer is like killing him,” because the killer cuts him off from the benefits of this world, and this cuts him off from the blessings of the Hereafter and the mercy of Allah, may He be exalted. And it was said that “Cursing a believer is like killing him” refers to the degree of sin, which is more likely. End quote. Thirdly: What is mentioned in the texts about some types of sinners being cursed, such as the thief, the one who drinks alcohol and the one who consumes riba, is to be interpreted as being general in meaning, not referring to any specific person, according to the majority of scholars. But it is not permissible to curse a specific person, because of the ahaadeeth which say that cursing is not allowed, and because that involves insulting and causing annoyance, which may lead to despairing of the mercy of Allah. That includes the hadeeth referred to in the question, which was narrated by al-Tabaraani from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “At the end of my ummah there will be women who are clothed yet naked, with something on their heads like the humps of camels; curse them for they are cursed.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in al-Thamar al-Mustataab (1/317) and in Jilbaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (p. 125). This is to be understood as a curse that is general in meaning, as stated above. You should convey this advice to your brother, so that he will stop doing this, because even though it is not haraam, as is the view of the majority of scholars, at the very least it is dubious, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever guards against the doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment from shortcomings and will protect his honour from slander, but whoever falls into that which is doubtful will fall into that which is haraam.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (52) and Muslim (1599). Moreover the believer should be keen to guide people and show compassion towards them, striving to call them and save them. Cursing does not lead to any such thing, rather if the one who is prayed against hears about it, it will put him off even more and will make him feel more resentful. How good it is for a man to get used to praying for people, such as saying: May Allah guide him, O Allah, guide them aright, and so on, which is beneficial for the one who prays and the one for whom he prays. People’s hearts are between two fingers of the Most Merciful, and who can be sure that he is safe? If you have been guided then praise Allah and hope for your brothers to be given the same blessings that you have been given. Remember the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His Favours (i.e. guided you to Islam)”[al-Nisa’ 4:94] What does this brother think of the words of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever among you sees one who has been stricken with calamity and says, ‘Praise be to Allah Who has spared me that with which He has tested you, and has favoured me over many of those whom He has created,’ Allah will protect him from that calamity, no matter what it is, so long as he lives.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3431); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. This is the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); this is his Sunnah and his example, in word and in deed. So adhere to it, and you will be one of those who are successful and are saved. May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allah knows best."
345,Ruling on buying and selling land,Question If according to Islam is it permissible to earn/profit out of the investing in land/property. Thank you very much for your help in advance.,"Praise be to Allah. Buying and selling land is permissible because it is included in the meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah has permitted trading” [al-Baqarah 2:275]. That applies whether it is for investment and profit, or in order to make use of it and benefit from it. But trading is subject to certain conditions in order to be valid, including: 1.The land in question should be clearly known, as should the price, so that both the buyer and seller will be aware of what is going on 2.The transaction should be by mutual consent. For more information please see the answer to question no. 103149 And Allah knows best."
346,Why is it permissible to take pictures of trees and rocks even though they are the creation of Allaah?,"Question I am wondering why it is possible to take pictures of buildings and other things, which are not moving. As Allah (SWT) says: 'Who does more wrong than the one, who tries to create something like my creation? Let him create a grain of wheat or a kernel of corn'. Why Allah gives an example of unmoving things? Why not birds, or people? I'm afraid may be it means that we can not even take a picture of unanimated things also?","Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah. The majority of scholars say that it is permissible to make pictures of inanimate objects such as trees, buildings, etc, and they quote several texts as evidence for that, including the following: The report narrated by al-Bukhaari (5963) and Muslim (2110) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Whoever makes an image in this world will be told to breathe life into it in the Day of Resurrection, and he will not be able to do so.’” The prohibition mentioned in this hadeeth has to do with animate objects. What confirms this interpretation is that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who was the narrator of this hadeeth, issued a fatwa permitting the drawing of trees and inanimate objects, as was narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (2225) and Saheeh Muslim (2110) from Sa’eed ibn Abi’l-Hasan, who said: “I was with Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) when a man came to him and said, ‘O Ibn ‘Abbaas, I am a man who earns a living by the work of my hands, and I make these pictures (or images).’ Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘I will only tell you what I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, and I heard him say, “Whoever makes an image in this world will be punished until he breathes life into it, and he will never be able to do so.’’ The man became very upset and his face turned pale. He – meaning Ibn ‘Abbaas – said, ‘Woe to you! If you insist on making them (images), then you can make images of these trees and everything that does not have a soul.’” In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5181) and Saheeh Muslim (2108) it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The makers of these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them: ‘Bring to life that which you have created!’” and he said that the angels will not enter a house in which there are images. This hadeeth indicates that the punishment has to do with images of animate beings, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that they will be told, “Bring to life that which you have created!” With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Let them create a grain of wheat or a grain of barley,” what is meant by that is to show that they are incapable of doing so, because no matter what humans make that may resemble these grains or plants in shape, they can never instill in them the characteristics of these plants, so they cannot be planted and will never grow, and so on. If humans are unable to create a single grain with some of the characteristics that Allaah has created in it, then they are incapable of breathing life into the images and statues that they make. Hence it becomes clear that what is meant by the hadeeth is not that which may first spring to mind, that making images of grains and trees and inanimate objects is haraam, rather what is meant is to show that man is incapable as we have mentioned above. And Allaah knows best."
347,Can You Make up Missed Fasts on the Day of Doubt?,"Question I know that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not allow fasting on the Day of Doubt, and he forbade fasting two days before Ramadan, but is it permissible for me to make up missed Ramadan fasts on these two days?","Praise be to Allah.Making up missed Ramadan fasts on the day of doubt Yes, it is permissible to make up missed Ramadan fasts on the day of doubt and one or two days before Ramadan. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting the day of doubt, and he forbade anticipating Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but this prohibition does not apply to a person who has a habitual pattern of fasting, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but if a man habitually fasts, then let him fast.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1914; Muslim, 1082) So if a person is used to fasting on Mondays , for example, and that coincides with the last day of Sha’ban, then it is permissible for him to observe that as a voluntary fast and it is not forbidden for him to do so. If it is permissible to observe a voluntary fast that one does regularly, then it is more appropriate that it should be permissible to make up a missed Ramadan fast, because that is obligatory, and because it is not permissible to delay making up missed fasts until after the following Ramadan. Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’, 6/399: “Our companions said: It is not correct to fast on the day of doubt when it is uncertain that Ramadan has begun, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point… But if a person fasts it to make up for a missed fast , or in fulfillment of a vow, or as an act of expiation (kaffarah), then it is permissible, because if it is permissible to observe a voluntary fast on that day for one who has a reason to do so, then it is more appropriate that one should be allowed to observe an obligatory fast. This is like the time when it is forbidden to pray (when one may nevertheless offer a prayer for which there is a reason). And if a person still owes some missed Ramadan fasts, then he has to observe those fasts, because the time for making it up has become very short.” And Allah knows best."
348,Ruling on bleeding that occurs intermittently during the month because of taking contraceptive pills,"Question I take contraceptive pills. When I forget a pill or take it late, even half an hour after I should take it, I begin to bleed, and it may continue for three or four days. In the beginning, I regarded it as being istihaadah (irregular bleeding), and I would do wudoo’ and change the pad for every prayer, but recently I found out that this blood is actually menstrual blood that appears intermittently during the month if I forget to take a pill or I inadvertently take it late. What made me certain about that is the fact that my period is now two days, and the bleeding that occurs at that time is very light. What is the ruling on the days on which bleeding occurs during the month? Should I continue to regard them as istihaadah, or should I regard them as days of menses and not pray? Also, changing the pad at the time of every prayer is something that is very difficult, especially if I am out of the house for a long time. Is it permissible for me to do wudoo’ only at the time of each prayer, if it is too difficult to change the pad, especially since this happens to me repeatedly, and is almost every ten days?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Disruption of the menstrual cycle because of contraceptive pills If the menstrual cycle is disrupted because of taking the pills mentioned, and you no longer have a regular period that comes at the time of your usual menses, with no regular time for its beginning and end, then in this case you must base your actions on distinguishing between the types of bleeding. What this means is that you should look at the blood that is emitted. Menstrual blood is black or dark, with an unpleasant odour, and is usually accompanied by pain (cramps); it is also thicker than the blood of istihaadah (irregular bleedings). Menstrual blood does not clot after it comes out, in contrast to the blood of istihaadah. Based on that, then whatever meets the description of menstrual blood is menses, and at that time you should stop praying and fasting, and you should do ghusl when it stops, even if it appears intermittently throughout the month, because of the disruption caused by the contraceptive pills. If the blood does not resemble menstrual blood from the outset, then it is istihaadah. Among the reports which speak about distinguishing between types of blood is that which was narrated by an-Nasaa’i (215) and Abu Dawood (304) from Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh, according to which she suffered from istihaadah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to her: “If it is menstrual blood, which is dark and recognizable, then refrain from praying, and if it is the other type, then do wudoo’, for it is only bleeding from a vein.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh an-Nasaa’i. This applies so long as the total number of days on which bleeding occurs intermittently does not exceed the maximum duration of menses, which is fifteen days. If it lasts longer than that, then you should refrain from praying and fasting for a total of fifteen days, even if the days on which the blood matches the description of menstrual blood are not consecutive. Then whatever occurs beyond that timeframe comes under the ruling on istihaadah. Please see the fatwa of Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr regarding a similar matter in the answer to question no. 25784 . For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 148451 and 220644 . Secondly Changing pads for every prayer in the case of istihaadah The woman who is suffering istihaadah should wear something (a pad or sanitary napkin) that will prevent the blood from spreading, and she should do wudoo’ for every prayer; she does not have to change the pad unless she has not placed it properly and securely. It says in ar-Rawd al-Murbi‘ (p. 57): The woman who is suffering istihaadah and others like her, such as one who is suffering from urinary incontinence, constant emission of madhiy or constant flatulence, or who has a wound that is constantly bleeding or has a continuous nosebleed, should wash the private part in order to remove whatever impurity is on it, then wrap it with something that will prevent spread of the impurity as much as possible. If it is not possible to wrap it, as in the case of haemorrhoids, he should pray as he is, and he does not have to repeat these two actions for every prayer, if he does his best. She should do wudoo’ when the time for each prayer begins, if anything has been emitted, and she may pray [with that wudoo’] so long as the time for the prayer has not ended, both obligatory and supererogatory prayers. If nothing has been omitted, then she does not have to do wudoo’. End quote. And Allah knows best."
349,Washing the deceased with soap and shampoo,Question What is the ruling on starting to wash the deceased with soap and shampoo if there is a lot of dirt on him?,"Praise be to Allah. What I think you should do is to do that which is mentioned in the hadeeth of Umm ‘Atiyyah, so wash the deceased with water and lotus leaves each time you wash him, starting on the right and washing the parts of the body washed in wudoo’, taking care to remove any dirt etc, each time you wash him, until he is clean, even if that means washing him more than seven times, because of the hadeeth mentioned. There is no need for soap, shampoo or anything else, unless the lotus leaves are not enough to remove the dirt, in which case it is o.k. to use soap, shampoo, potash and other kinds of dirt-removers from the first wash, and to put some camphor in the final washing, because of the hadeeth mentioned. This is the Sunnah as far as I know from the saheeh ahaadeeth, because of the hadeeth of Umm ‘Atiyyah and similar ahaadeeth."
350,The mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn,Question Is it true that the pebbles and crumbs in the mosque are a symbol of the dowry of the hoor al-‘iyn?.,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is no saheeh hadeeth that defines the mahr of the hoor al-‘iyn. Everything that has been narrated concerning that is either very weak (da’eef jiddan) or fabricated (mawdoo’), A summary of what has been narrated concerning that from six of the Sahaabah follows: 1- It was narrated in a marfoo’ report from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: “How many of the hoor al-‘iyn have a mahr that is no more than a handful of wheat or dates.” This was narrated by al-‘Aqeeli (1/42) and from him by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat (3/253) and Ibn Hibbaan in al-Majrooheen (1/98). Ibn al-Jawzi said: The one who is accused is Abaan. Abu Haatim Ibn Hibbaan said: Abaan ibn al-Muhbir narrated from trustworthy narrators things that are not their ahaadeeth, so as to confuse even those who have great knowledge. It is not permissible to narrate from him except by way of giving an example of a false hadeeth. He is the one who narrated this hadeeth from Naafi’ and it is baatil (false). al-Daaraqutni said: Abaan is matrook (i.e., his hadeeth is to be ignored). End quote. Ibn Abi Haatim said in al-‘Ilal (no. 641): My father said: This is a baatil hadeeth. This Abaan is majhool (unknown) and da’eef al-hadeeth. End quote. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (no. 571): It is mawdoo’ (fabricated). 2- He also narrated a hadeeth from Abu Hurayrah: “The mahr of the hoor al-‘iyn is a handful dates and a piece of bread.” This was narrated by Ibn ‘Adiyy in al-Kaamil (5/25) and by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat (3/253). He said: The one who is accused is ‘Umar ibn Subh. Ibn Hibbaan said: He used to fabricate ahaadeeth from trustworthy narrators. It is not permissible to write down his hadeeth except by way of highlighting its strangeness. End quote. 3- Another hadeeth which is well known among people but is not saheeh is that which is attributed to Anas: “Sweeping the mosque is the mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn.” This was narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad Firdaws (no. 4896) and Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat (3/253). He said: Its isnaad contains narrators who are majhool (unknown), and ‘Abd al-Waahid is not thiqah (trustworthy). This was also stated by Yahya. Al-Bukhaari, al-Fallaas and al-Nasaa’i said: He is matrook al-hadeeth (i.e., his hadeeth is to be rejected). End quote. Shaykh al-Albaani judged it to be fabricated in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (no. 4147). 4- It is narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: “O ‘Ali, give the hoor al-‘iyn their mahrs: remove harmful things from the road, and take rubbish out of the mosque, for that is the mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn.” This was narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws (no. 8335) and Ibn Shaheen in al-Targheeb fi Fadaa’il al-A’maal (no. 535). In Kanz al-‘Ummaal (16/229) it is attributed to Ibn al-Najjaar. The isnaad of Ibn Shaheen includes al-Ma’aafa ibn Mutahhar and Muwarra’ ibn Jubayr, but I could not find any biography for them, except a few words by Ibn Makula in al-Ikmaal (7/263). 5- It was also narrated from Abu Umaamah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Handfuls of dates for the poor are the mahrs of al-hoor al-‘iyn.” This was narrated by al-Daylami in al-Firdaws (no. 4645 and Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat (3/253). In Jaami’ al-Ahaadeeth (no. 15093), al-Suyooti attributed it to al-Daaraqutni in al-Afraad. Ibn al-Jawzi said: It was narrated only by Talhah ibn al-Wadeen. Al-Sa’di said: al-Wadeen is a weak narrator. al-Nasaa’i said: Talhah is matrook (i.e., to be rejected). Ibn Hibbaan said: It is not permissible to narrate from him. End quote. Al-Albaani judged it to be fabricated in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (no. 6197). 6- A hadeeth about the mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn was narrated from Abu Qursaafah, whose name was Jandarah: “Taking rubbish out of the mosque is the mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn.” This was narrated by al-Tabaraani (3/19), Ibn ‘Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (5/110), Abu Bakr al-Shaafa’i in al-Fawaa’id (2/23/2) and Ibn Mandah in al-Ma’rifah (2/259, no. 6340). In al-Durr al-Manthoor (4/144), al-Suyooti attributed it to Abu Bakr al-Shaafa’i in his Rubaa’iyaat. Al-Bayhaqi said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (2/113): Its isnaad includes majhool (unknown) narrators. End quote. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (no. 1675): This isnaad is “dark” (i.e., it has many unknown narrators), other than Abu Qursaafah they have no mention in any of the books of men’s biographies, apart from Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Qutaybah, who is proven to be a hafiz and trustworthy. End quote. To sum up, there is no saheeh hadeeth which defines the mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn, hence Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mawdoo’aat (3/254): This hadeeth is not saheeh in any of its isnaads. End quote. Secondly: The true mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn is every good deed that brings one closer to Allaah, and is the cause of entering Paradise. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Tadhkirah fi Ahwaal al-Mawtaa wa Umoor al-Aakhirah (p. 556): Chapter on what is narrated about righteous deeds being the mahr of al-hoor al-‘iyn. In this chapter he narrated some of the ahaadeeth quoted above, then he said: Muhammad ibn al-Nu’maan al-Muqari said: I was sitting with al-Jala al-Muqari in Makkah in al-Masjid al-Haraam, when a tall, lean-bodied old man dressed in rags passed by. Al-Jala got up and stood with him for a while, then came back to us and said: Do you know who this old man is? We said: No. He said: He bought from Allaah a hoor al-‘iyn for four thousand khatmahs (readings of the entire Qur’aan) and when he had completed it, he saw her in a dream, wearing her jewellery and finery. He said: Who are you? She said: I am al-hoor whom you bought from Allaah with four thousand khatmahs; this is the price, what will I get from you? He said: One thousand khatmahs. Al-Jala said: He is still working on that. It was narrated from Sahnoon that he said: There was a man in Egypt called Sa’eed, and he had a mother who was a devoted worshipper. When he got up at night to pray qiyaam, his mother would pray behind him, and if he grew sleepy his mother would call out to him: O Sa’eed! There is no sleep for the one who fears Hell and wants to marry the beautiful hoor al-‘iyn. So he would get up out of alarm. It was narrated from Thaabit that he said: My father was one of those who prayed qiyaam to Allaah in the depths of the night. He said: Last night I saw in my dream a woman who did not resemble the women of this world. I said to her: Who are you? She said: A hoor al-‘iyn, a female slave of Allaah. I said to her: Give yourself to me in marriage. She said: Propose to me through your Lord and give me a mahr. I said: What is your mahr? She said: Lengthy tahajjud. Maalik ibn Dinar said: I had sections of the Quraan that I would read every night. I fell asleep one night and in my dream I saw a beautiful girl, with a piece of vellum in her hand. She said: Can you read? I said: Yes. She gave me the piece of vellum and on it was written these lines of poetry: You are wasting your time in sleeping rather than seeking high goals And seeking beautiful hoor al-‘iyn in Paradise. There in Paradise you will have an eternal life and no death And you will have delight with the beautiful hoor ‘iyn in splendid pavilions. Wake up from your sleep, for what is better than sleeping is spending the night reciting the Qur’aan. End quote. Something similar was said by Ibn Rajab in his essay Ikhtiyaar al-Oola (p. 12) and in Lataa’if al-Ma’aarif (p. 159). See also question no. 10053 about al-hoor al’-iyn. With regard to cleaning the mosque, it is something that is recommended, and there is a great deal of evidence which encourages that and speaks of its virtue. This has been discussed on our website in the answer to question no. 20160. And Allaah knows best."
351,Ruling on working in a job selling counterfeit clothing and paying a bribe to bring it into the country,"Question I work in the field of trade and import with a shipping agent. This agent brings these particular goods in by means of bribery. Please note that the goods in question are counterfeit clothes bearing the logos of internationally-know brands such as Lacoste and Adidas, and that is not allowed. Is my business halaal or haraam?","Praise be to Allah.If these items of clothing are sold on the basis that they are manufactured by those internationally-known brands with those famous logos, when in fact that is not the case, then selling them and dealing in them is deceiving and cheating the purchasers. All of that is prohibited according to the teachings of our religion. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives (people) does not belong to me.” Narrated by Muslim (102). The matter becomes more sinful if they are brought into the country by unlawful means and haraam bribes that are paid in order to bring them in. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (11/73): It is not permissible to sell counterfeit goods claiming that they are original, and it is not permissible to deal in them or distribute them to shops, because that comes under the heading of deceiving the Muslims, lying and defrauding them… and because that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression, and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {do not cooperate in sin and transgression} [al-Maa’idah 5:2] {And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly} [al-Baqarah 2:188]. Moreover, that also causes harm to those who sell the original, non-counterfeit goods, and is competing unlawfully with them. Based on that, selling these goods without informing the purchaser that they are counterfeit is haraam and is a cause of blessing (barakah) being erased from one’s business dealings. End quote. Therefore what you must do is stop dealing in these fraudulent clothes, whether you are selling them or helping to bring them into the country by any means, because this comes under the heading of helping in sin and transgression. We ask Allah to make it easy for you to find another way of doing lawful business. And Allah knows best."
352,She is afraid that she will be deprived of reward if she undergoes procedures to reduce pain in childbirth,"Question Here in australia there are many ways in which we can relief the pain during labour like epidural..In epidural,we cant feel a thing in labour.But in islam it says that we geta lot of savaab duirng labour due to the pain.So if i do epidural or use any pain relief in my labour,will i get any savaab(savaab Allah willgive during labour in women)???Can you please tell me in detail about this???.","Praise be to Allah.Everything that befalls the believer of exhaustion, hardship or pain expiates his sins, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No misfortune or disease befalls a Muslim, no worry or grief or harm or distress – not even a thorn that pricks him – but Allaah will expiate for some of his sins because of that.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5642) and Muslim (2573). This does not mean that a person should look for hardship or should not try to avoid it, rather every time a person does that which is easier, he is closer to that which Allaah loves, so long as it is not a sin. Hence ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he chose the easier of them, so long as it was not a sin. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3560). And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah likes His concessions (rukhsah) to be taken, as He hates to be disobeyed.” Narrated by Ahmad (5832) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (564). Based on that, there is nothing wrong with using things that reduce pain in childbirth, or prevent pain altogether. The process of childbirth is not free of hardship and dangers, and the grace of Allaah is immense. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: A woman is saying that she is physically weak, and she gave birth to a child with difficulty. They gave her some fluid saying that it would induce labour as her contractions were weak, but with this induced labour she says that she felt “as if I had lost my mind” and she was very weakness after the birth, and that weakness lasted for almost a year. She says that she got pregnant after that with her second child and some people advised her to go to a special hospital where they gave her an anaesthetic by injection because she could not bear the induced labour. She also says: After they gave me the anaesthetic, I did not feel the pain of childbirth and slept a little. Is this permissible, O Shaykh? She says that she is three months pregnant. I hope that you can advise us, may Allaah reward you with good, because some people have told me that this is not permissible. He replied (may Allaah have mercy on him): If the pains of childbirth are too difficult for a woman, and she takes some permissible medicines to help her cope with that, then there is nothing wrong with that, and it comes under the heading of enjoying the blessings of Allaah. Allaah in His kindness, generosity and grace likes His slaves to enjoy the blessings that He has bestowed upon them, and He likes to see the effects of His blessing on His slave. Using these medicines in labour and the like is something that is permissible and there is nothing wrong with that, because Allaah likes ease for His slaves as Allaah says: “Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you” [al-Baqarah 2:185]. End quote. Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb (al-Janaa’iz/al-Ahkaam al-Tibbiyyah) With regard to the amount of reward, that is up to Allaah. And Allaah knows best."
353,Is it obligatory to obey a ruler who does not rule according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him)?,Question Is it obligatory to obey a ruler who does not rule according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him)?.,"Praise be to Allah.The ruler who does not rule according to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger should be obeyed in matters that do not involve disobedience towards Allaah and His Messenger, and it is not obligatory to fight him because of that; rather it is not permissible to do so unless he reaches the level of kufr, in which case it becomes obligatory to oppose him and he has no right to be obeyed by the Muslims. Ruling according to anything other than that which is in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger reaches the level of kufr when two conditions are met: 1.When he knows the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; if he is unaware of it, then he does not commit kufr by going against it. 2.When what makes him rule by something other than that which Allaah has revealed is the belief that it is a ruling that is not suitable for our time and that something else is more suitable than it and more beneficial for people. If these two conditions are met, then ruling by something other than that which Allaah has revealed constitutes kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers)” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. The authority of the ruler becomes invalid and he has no right to be obeyed by the people; it becomes obligatory to fight him and remove him from power. But if he rules by something other than that which Allaah has revealed whilst believing that ruling by that – i.e. that which Allaah has revealed -- is what is obligatory, and that it is more suitable for the people, but he goes against it because of some whims and desires on his part or because he wants to wrong the people under his rule, then he is not a kaafir; rather he is a faasiq (evildoer) or a zaalim (wrongdoer). His authority remains, and obeying him in matters that do not involve disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger is obligatory, and it is not permissible to fight him or remove him from power by force or to rebel against him, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) forbade rebelling against rulers unless we see blatant kufr for which we have proof from Allaah. End quote."
354,She got to know someone over the phone and he promised to marry her,"Question I want to know if what I am doing is halaal or haraam. I got to know a person over the phone and he has promised to marry me, but circumstances dictated that he had to delay this promise. We are still in touch and he says that he knows me well and has seen me, but I have never seen him. I also want to explain that this person is two years younger than me. My question is: is it halaal to remain in touch with him, or is it haraam?.","Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your question and your keenness to find out what is halaal and what is haraam in such matters concerning which many people are becoming heedless. We praise Allaah for instilling in your heart the awareness of faith which is the reason for your anxiety about this telephone relationship, for the hearts that are truly alive are those that sense the danger of sin and are affected by any damage, whereas hearts that are dead are heedless and feel nothing, as it is said: The dead feel no pain. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Sin is that which wavers in your heart and which you do not like the people to find out about.” Narrated by Muslim (2553). Secondly: For a woman to speak to a man on the phone or otherwise, if it leads to her being tempted or being a source of temptation, it is haraam. That includes speaking of emotional matters such as love and affection, describing oneself, promising to meet and so on, because these are things that lead to immorality, and they are the steps that the shaytaan uses to trap women who are chaste and unaware. The wolf will carry on speaking softly, weaving dreams, making promises and swearing oaths until the woman falls prey to him. How often has honour been violated, how often have the sacred limits been transgressed, how many calamities have been caused, when the first step was a phone call? Most of these wolves are liars and cheats who do not know the meaning of true love, and they have no intention of honourable marriage. They are only striving for depraved ends, and seeking to please the shaytaan. One of them stated that he does that sometimes for fun, sometimes for the love of power and temptation, and sometimes to feel proud that he entrapped So and so. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek. So beware, and save yourself. The most precious things that a woman possesses are her honour, her modesty and her chastity. This evil wolf will not be ashamed to mention his conquests to his friends, and he will say that he said such and such to her, and did such and such to her, until she is mentioned on the lips of the evildoers, and perhaps he may persuade her to meet him, or he will record her voice or take her picture, and use that a means to blackmail her and scare her, and try to get something even worse from her. May Allaah protect you and save you from all evil. What we have said is not just mere words intended to scare you; rather it is a reference to dozens of stories that have actually happened in modern times, with the widespread availability of phones and chat rooms. They are sad and embarrassing stories that indicate the extent of the hard-heartedness of these playboys, and the weakness of women before their tricks. They clearly point to the greatness of the words of our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al‑Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al‑Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allaah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allaah is All‑Hearer, All‑Knower” [al-Noor 24:21] Speaking on the phone may be one of the footsteps of the shaytaan, as may be a look, a smile or soft speech, which affects the one in whose heart is a disease, so he builds it into mountains of dreams and thoughts, which results in hopes, efforts and plots aimed at evil. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner” [al-Ahzaab 33:32] We ask our sister – may Allaah protect her and keep her safe – is a phone conversation between a young man and a young woman free from soft speech, laughter and so on? How can it be otherwise, when they are speaking of marriage and hoping to meet? How can there not be any fitnah (temptation), how can there not be any attachment, how can there not be any hope in the sick heart? If these plotters say that they want to get married, this is a false claim, because the way to get married is well known and is easily accessible; they are not ignorant of it. But they are running away from it and avoiding it, and they are resorting to the tricks and deceit of the shaytaan. Moreover, if a man desires a woman, it does not mean that he is suitable as a husband for her; he may be inferior to her in all ways, in age, knowledge, status and wealth, which means that he is unacceptable in most cases. How can the desire of an unknown person be a justification for him getting to know a girl and getting carried away with her, speaking to her and making promises of marriage? How can a wise woman consent to forming an attachment to one whose identity and circumstances are unknown, and wish to marry him, and wait for him to come? Perhaps he will not be suitable. Perhaps if she sees him she will prefer spinsterhood to marrying him. Hasten to put an end to this relationship and regret it, and ask Allaah for forgiveness. Keep yourself busy with things that will benefit you, both religious and worldly. Remember that a good marriage is provision that Allaah gives to a righteous woman. He has promised those who obey Him that He will give them more of His bounty, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)” [al-Nahl 16:97] Do a great deal of acts of worship and du’aa’, and close all doors that may lead to fitnah. Be pure and chaste, so that no evildoer could ever hope to get anywhere near you. May Allaah help us and you to obey Him and please Him. And Allaah knows best."
355,Ruling on treating patches in the beard,"Question If there are some patches where the beard does not grow, is it permissible to treat it with some medicine in order to make it grow?","Praise be to Allah.If there is the hope that it will grow by itself, he should not try to treat it, because this is not a defect. Often when young men start to grow their beards, the beard does not grow evenly, so he should wait. But if it is a defect, in the sense that we know and are sure that it will never grow by itself, then there is no problem with treating that, so that the rest of it will grow, especially if it is unsightly. But if it is not unsightly, then the best is not to treat it with anything, because I fear that that may come under the heading of adding hair extensions, for which the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who adds hair extensions and the one who asks for that to be done.

356,Eating the food of one whose income comes from selling wine,Question if one of our friends sells wine in his shop....infact wine is the basic thing being sold at his shop and he does not pray either ...then r we allowed to eat at his house.…,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be friends with a man who is a “stranger” to her (i.e. he is not her mahram). The one who does not pray is not a Muslim, because of the hadeeth, “All that stands between a man and kufr is his giving up prayer.” If the source of his wealth is haraam, then do not eat at his house. This man who is not your mahram is a kaafir because he does not pray, and the source of his wealth is haraam, so what good is there in keeping company with him and eating his food? Fear Allaah and keep away from him at once. We ask Allaah to keep you safe and sound."
357,Differences Between Zakah and Sadaqah,Question What is zakah? And what is the difference between Sadaqah and zakah?,"Praise be to Allah.What is zakah? Zakah in Arabic means growth, blessing and purification. (See Lisan al-‘Arab, 14/358;, 2/399) With regard to the shar’i definition, Zakah means worshipping Allah by giving that which He has enjoined of different kinds of zakah to those who are entitled to them, according to the guidelines prescribed in shari’ah. What is sadaqah? Sadaqah comes from the word sidq (sincerity), i.e. it is a sign of sincerity of faith on the part of the person who gives it. (See Fath al-Qadir, 2/399) Sadaqah means worshipping Allah by giving money without that being made obligatory in shari’ah. The word sadaqah is sometimes used to refer to obligatory zakah. Difference between zakah and sadaqah With regard to the difference between zakah and sadaqah, it is as follows: Zakah is enjoined in Islam on specific things, which are: gold, silver, crops, fruits, trade goods and an’am livestock, i.e., camels, cattle and sheep. With regard to sadaqah, it is not obligatory on any kind of wealth, rather it is what a person can give, without any specific limits or guidelines. Zakah is subject to the conditions that one full Hijri year has passed since acquiring the wealth, and that the wealth meets the minimum threshold (nisab), and it is a specific portion of wealth. Sadaqah is not subject to any conditions, and it may be given at any time, in any amount. Allah has enjoined that zakah be given to certain types of people , and it is not permissible to give it to anyone else. They are the people mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqara (poor), and Al-Masakin (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujahidun — those fighting in Allah’s cause), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:60] With regard to sadaqah, it may be given to those mentioned in the verse on zakah and to others. Whoever dies and owes zakah, his heirs must pay it from his wealth, and that takes precedence over the will (wasiyyah) and inheritance. As for sadaqah, there are no such obligations with regard to it. The one who withholds zakah is to be punished, as it says in the hadith narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (987) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no owner of treasure who does not pay his zakah, but it will be heated in the Fire of Hell and made into plates with which his sides and forehead will be branded until Allah passes judgement between His slaves on a Day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years, then he will see his path and whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell. And there is no owner of camels who does not pay zakah on them, but a soft sandy plain will be prepared for him and they will be made to step on him. Every time the last of them has gone the first of them will return, until Allah passes judgement between His slaves on a Day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years, then he will see his path and whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell. And there is no owner of sheep who does not pay zakah on them but a soft sandy plain will be prepared for him, and he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns or without horns or with broken horns, and they will be made to gore him with their horns and trample him with their hooves. Every time the last of them has gone the first of them will return, until Allah passes judgement between His slaves on a Day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years, then he will see his path and whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell…” With regard to sadaqah, the one who does not pay it will not be punished. According to the four schools of law, it is not permissible to give zakah to one’s ascendants or descendants . Ascendants include one’s mother, father, grandfathers and grandmothers ; descendants include one's children and their children. Sadaqah may be given to one's ascendants and descendants. It is not permissible to give zakah to one who is rich or who is strong and able to earn a living. ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Adiyy said: Two men told me that they came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage when he was distributing the zakah and asked him for some of it. He looked them up and down, and saw that they were strong and able-bodied. He said, “If you wish, I will give you some, but those who are rich or strong and able to earn have no share of it.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1633; al-Nasai, 2598; classed as sahih by Imam Ahmad and others.) (See Talkhis al-Habir, 3/108) Sadaqah may be given to those who are rich and those who are strong and able to earn. In the case of zakah, it is better for it to be taken from the rich of a land and given to their poor. Many scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to send it to another country unless that serves an interest. But charity /sadaqah may be spent on those who are near and those who are far. It is not permissible to give zakah to kuffar and mushrikin. Sadaqah may be given to kuffar and mushrikin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to the Miskin (the poor), the orphan, and the captive” [al-Insan 76:8] Al-Qurtubi said: In dar al-Islam (the Muslim lands), a captive could only be a mushrik. It is not permissible for a Muslim to give zakah to his wife. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that there was scholarly consensus on this point. But sadaqah may be given to one’s wife. These are some of the differences between zakah and sadaqah. Every good deed is a charity The word sadaqah may also be applied to all kinds of good deeds . Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sahih: “Chapter: every good deed is a charity /sadaqah” then he narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every good deed is a charity.” Ibn Battal said: “This hadith indicates that every good thing that a person does or says is recorded for him as an act of charity .” Al-Nawawi said: “The Prophet’s words “Every good deed is a charity” means that it is like charity in reward.” And Allah knows best."
358,"Is it permissible to study in a mixed educational centre with better qualified teachers, when there is another centre where there is no mixing but the teachers are less qualified?","Question Here in Egypt, at the public secondary education level, students rely completely on classes offered in educational centres, because of the prevailing system. These classes include both males and females. Is attending these classes, whilst disapproving and denouncing that, a sin? If there is a teacher who does not allow mixing, but he is less qualified than the teacher who allows mixing, should I leave the one who is more highly qualified?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: In the answer to question no. 1200 we explained the prohibition on free mixing and the negative consequences that result from it, especially when it happens among youth in educational settings. Secondly: in the answer to questions no. 70223 and 127946 we explained that in countries in which the people are faced with free mixing in most areas of life, especially in educational institutions and work places, there is a concession granted to them in that regard which is not granted to others, based on the fiqhi principle that “whatever is prohibited so as to bar the means that may lead to evil may be permitted in cases of necessity and where doing so serves a greater interest.” However care should be taken to guard one’s tongue, lower one’s gaze and avoid anything that may be a cause of temptation. Thirdly: This is in general terms, in places where this problem is widespread and the Muslim is not able to change it. But in specific terms, if a Muslim is able to enrol in a school in which there is no mixing, or in an education centre or private classes in which the genders are separated, then he must enrol in such classes, so as to avoid trouble and ward off temptation, and so as to adhere to the limits set by Allah, may He be exalted. But if that is not available, or it is available to some extent but there is a great difference in the educational level between the two options, and he fears that he may be adversely affected or may miss out on some benefits because of that, then in that case there is a concession allowing him to enrol in that which is more beneficial to him, even if there is free mixing in that place. However it is essential for him to denounce the evil as much as he is able to, and to adhere to his religious commitment and good manners, by remembering that Allah, may He be exalted, is always watching. So he should guard his tongue, lower his gaze and avoid as much as possible places where there is mingling and direct interaction. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on a woman going to a male doctor to treat her, when there is a female doctor in the same specialty? He replied: If the specialty is the same, and the man and the woman are equal in terms of their skill level, then a woman should not go to the male doctor, because there is no need to do so. But if the man is more skilled than the woman, or more specialised, then there is nothing wrong with the woman going to him, even if there is a female doctor, because this is a case of need, and in case of need such things are permissible. End quote from Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam (p. 693) But if he is a person who fears that he may be tempted and fall into sin, then he does not have the right to do that, because preserving one’s religious commitment takes precedence over all other interests. In that case he should leave these educational centres for the sake of Allah, and enrol in a place that pays attention to separating the sexes, even if its level of education is lower. Then he should strive hard in his studies and think positively of his Lord, when he refrains from attending the mixed institution for the sake of Allah, for whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something that is better for him than it. Please see the answer to question no. 50398 For more information, please see also the answer to question no. 128996 And Allah knows best."
359,Seeking barakah (blessing) from water in which there is said to be a hair of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),"Question I have attended a lecture in Jordan. It was about the supporting Islam and masjid Al-Aqsa. During the lecture, they brought water and said that a hair of the prophet (PBUH) is in this water. This hair exists in masjid Al-jazzar located in Akka, Palestine. They put the water into a small pot and mixed it with a large tank of water, so that it is enough for all women. I took some water like all women. The question is: is it permissible to seek barakah in such water, for purpose of cure? I still did not use this water.","Praise be to Allah.The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to seek barakah from the relics of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as his hair, sweat and other things, because there is evidence to that effect. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stoned the Jamrah and offered his sacrifice and shaved his head, he showed his right side to the barber and he shaved it, then he called Abu Talhah al-Ansaari and gave it to him. Then he showed him the left side and said: “Shave it.” So he shaved it, and he gave it to Abu Talhah and said: “Share it out among the people.” Narrated by Muslim (1305). And it was narrated from Anas that Umm Sulaym used to put out a mat of leather for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he would take a nap in her house. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fell asleep, she took some of his sweat and hair and kept it in a bottle, then she put it in some sukk (perfume made of musk). He [Thumaamah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Anas] said: When Anas ibn Maalik was dying, he left instructions that some of the sukk should be put in his hunoot (perfumes used in preparation of dead for burial). Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6281). This and other reports indicate that Allaah created barakah in the person of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and whatever separated from it of hair, sweat and so on, from which barakah may be sought and one may hope for benefit therefrom in this world and the in the Hereafter. The One Who bestows this goodness is Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted. But the claim nowadays that this is one of the hairs or relics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a claim for which there is no proof. Most of the claims that are made to that effect are lies and myths, such as their saying that this is a hair of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) because if it is placed in the sun it has no shadow. No attention should be paid to such words. Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: We know that his relics – such as his garments, hair and so on – have been lost, and it is not possible for anyone to prove that any of them exist for certain. Al-Tawassul, p. 147. Based on this, it is not permissible to seek barakah from the water you asked about, unless it is known for certain that what was placed in it is a hair of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but there is no way to prove that. We should beware of charlatans and liars and propagators of bid’ah, and we should acquire knowledge from people who are known to have knowledge of the Sunnah and who are defenders of the Sunnah and who strive hard to spread the Sunnah. It is amazing how a gathering to support the religion could turn into encouraging people to believe in unproven matters. It would have been better for the lecturer to call people to learn and adhere to the Sunnah, because that is one of the means of success. May Allaah enable us and you to follow the Sunnah properly. And Allaah knows best."
360,Various issues concerning Hajj and ‘Umrah,"Question Allah has blessed me and I have been chosen to be among the doctors who will be sent with the Egyptian group to care for pilgrims to the House of Allah, and by Allah’s leave I will perform Hajj this year. I have been allocated to the clinic in al-Madinah al-Munawwarah. The journey from Egypt will be directly to Madinah, and I will stay there until the eighth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah. I am going to do ‘Umrah before Hajj, then do Hajj, then return to Madinah until it is time to go home. My questions are as follows: 1. What is the wording of the niyyah (intention) and Talbiyah for Hajj and ‘Umrah? 2. What is the miqaat for entering ihram, seeing that I do not know when I will be doing ‘Umrah? 3. If I am doing tamattu‘ [doing ‘umrah followed by Hajj, exiting ihram in between], what is the latest time I can perform ‘Umrah in Dhu’l-Hijjah before the 8th or 9th? 4. Is it permissible to do ‘Umrah after Hajj in the case of qiraan [doing ‘umrah and Hajj together, without exiting ihram in between] or tamattu‘, if I cannot do it before Hajj? 5. Is it permissible to do more than one ‘Umrah, either before or after Hajj? Please note that I will stay for a while after Hajj is over. 6. Someone asked me to convey his salaam to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him); is that permissible? 7. One of my acquaintances asked me to do ‘Umrah for her and give the reward thereof to her as a gift. Please note that she is physically in good shape, and I do not know whether she would be able to afford the expenses of ‘Umrah or not, but she cannot ask her husband to do ‘Umrah. 8. I am not going to pay for the expenses of this Hajj out of my own pocket; rather on the contrary I will receive some payment. Will I have performed my (obligatory) Hajj, or should it be from my own money?","Praise be to Allah.-1- There is a difference between the niyyah (intention) and the Talbiyah with regard to the pilgrimage. The place for the niyyah is in the heart and it should not be uttered out loud. It is obligatory in the case of Hajj and other acts of worship. As for the Talbiyah, it is mustahabb according to some scholars and is obligatory according to others. It is prescribed for the pilgrim in ihram to say it out loud. The purpose of the Talbiyah is to define the type of pilgrimage. The one who wants to do ‘Umrah says in his Talbiyah: “Labbayk Allahumma ‘umratan (Here I am, O Allah, for ‘umrah)” and the one who wants to do Hajj says in his Talbiyah: “Labbayk Allahummah Hajjan (Here I am, O Allah, for Hajj”). The one who wants to do Hajj and ‘umrah together says “Labbayk Allahumma ‘umratan wa hajjan (Here I am, O Allah, for ‘umrah and Hajj).” Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It should be noted that the place for the intention is the heart. It is not Sunnah for a person to say “O Allah, I have intended to do ‘Umrah” or “I have intended to do Hajj”, because there is no report to that effect from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Rather he should say Talbiyah based on what he intends. The Talbiyah is not regarded as expressing the intention, because the Talbiyah signifies responding to Allah, so in and of itself it is dhikr which is not expressing the intention in the heart. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (2/291) For more information, please see the answer to question no. 31821 -2- So long as you are going to travel from your country, Egypt, directly to al-Madinah al-Munawwarah, then you should enter ihram from the miqaat of Madinah, which is Dhu’l-Hulayfah. You do not have to enter ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah from Egypt, or from the time you arrive in Madinah. Rather when you decide to travel to Makkah, you should enter ihram from the miqat of the people of Madinah. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 135298 and 96758 -3- It is preferable to do the ‘umrah of Tamattu‘ before Duha (mid-morning) on the 8th of Dhu’l-Hijjah (Yawm at-Tarwiyah), because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “…whosoever performs the Umrah in the months of Hajj, before (performing) the Hajj, (i.e. Hajj-at-Tamattu‘ and Al-Qiran)…” [al-Baqarah 2:196]. So tamattu‘ ends with Hajj, and the deeds of Hajj begin on the eighth day (of Dhu’l-Hijjah). Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it valid to do tamattu‘ after the time for Hajj begins, i.e., after Zuhr on the eighth? He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “…whosoever performs the Umrah in the months of Hajj, before (performing) the Hajj, (i.e. Hajj-at-Tamattu‘ and Al-Qiran)…” [al-Baqarah 2:196]. This indicates that ‘umrah should be done before the time for Hajj comes. So if you come to Makkah on the eighth, then you have only two choices: ifraad (doing Hajj only) or qiraan. As for tamattu‘, the time for it has ended. The individual should not let himself be distracted from going out to Mina, because when the time of Duha comes on the eighth, what he is required to do is be in Mina, but if he does ‘Umrah that will take time away from the time of Hajj. That is because the time of Hajj begins at Duha (mid-morning) on the eighth, as the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) entered ihram at that time. If a person comes late, then what I prefer in his case is that he should do Hajj on its own (ifraad), or Hajj and ‘umrah together (qiraan). As for tamattu‘, it is not an option in this case. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (22/52) -4- Doing ‘umrah after Hajj with the intention of tamattu‘ or qiraan is not valid, because ‘umrah of tamattu‘, according to the Qur’anic text, can only come before Hajj; Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “…whosoever performs the Umrah in the months of Hajj, before (performing) the Hajj, (i.e. Hajj-at-Tamattu‘ and Al-Qiran)…” [al-Baqarah 2:196]. When the time for Hajj begins, if the pilgrim has not done ‘umrah before that, then he has missed out on tamattu‘. Moreover he cannot do ‘umrah after Hajj with the intention of Hajj qiraan. If he does that, his Hajj and ‘umrah cannot be regarded as having been done together; rather he has done Hajj separately and ‘umrah separately. But he can do Hajj qiraan and combine the two rituals in his intention and in his Talbiyah, by saying “Labbayk Allahumma Hajjan wa ‘umratan (Here I am, O Allah, for Hajj and ‘umrah)”, and also in his actions. This is the best option for him if he has missed tamattu‘. Rather some of the scholars regarded it as the best way of combining the two. Whatever the case, it is preferable to Hajj ifraad, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on that point. Moreover, when he does his Hajj, he will be able to combine Hajj and ‘umrah (qiraan), because he will do the actions once and not distinguish between them. In that case he should not think that he has missed out on ‘umrah if he is doing qiraan. He also has the option of doing the third type of pilgrimage, which is to do Hajj on its own (ifraad). This is the least favoured option, because it involves the least actions. Those who do tamattu‘ and qiraan do two pilgrimages, whereas the one who does ifraad does only one. With regard to the issue of doing ‘umrah before or after Hajj, please see the answers to questions no. 126752 -5- Requesting the one who is travelling to the Prophet’s Mosque to convey salaam to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is something that is not prescribed in Islam; it was not part of the practice of the righteous early generations, namely the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een. Moreover, our blessings (salawaat) upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reach him no matter where we are. Abu Dawood (2042) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not make your houses graves and do not make my grave a place of regular visitation. Send blessings (salaah) upon me, for your blessing will reach me no matter where you are.” If our blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) reach him no matter where we are, there is no point in sending salaams to him with someone else. For more information, please see the answer to question no. 69807 -6- Doing ‘umrah on behalf of someone else is permissible if that other person is unable to do it because of old age or sickness from which there is no hope of recovery, or if he is deceased. The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: I want to go on ‘umrah to the Sacred House of Allah, then when I have finished my ‘umrah, I want to do ‘umrah on behalf of my parents – who are both still alive, praise be to Allah, and on behalf of their fathers – who have both died, may Allah have mercy on them. Is this valid on my part, or not? They replied: When you have done ‘umrah on your own behalf, it is permissible for you to do ‘umrah on behalf of your mother and father, if they are unable to do it because of old age or sickness from which there is no hope of recovery. It is also permissible for you to do ‘umrah on behalf of your parents’ fathers who have died. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (11/80-81) For more information, please see the answer to question no. 10318 and 65641. -7- It is not essential in the case of Hajj for it to be done only with the pilgrim’s own money. If he does Hajj at the expense of someone else, his Hajj is valid and the obligation has been fulfilled. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: What is the ruling on one who does Hajj at the expense of the ruler? That is if one of the rulers wants to give his subjects some money and he says to them: Do Hajj with this money. Is it permissible for them to do Hajj with it, or not? If they do Hajj with it, have they fulfilled the Islamic obligation to do Hajj? Please provide evidence for what you say. They replied: It is permissible for them to do that, and their Hajj is valid, because of the general meaning of the evidence. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (11/36). Similar to that, and in fact more appropriately so, is the case of one who works during Hajj in order to earn money, and also does Hajj. There is nothing wrong with him doing that, so long as he is not distracted from the actions of Hajj. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Trade is not haraam, but a person should not do any work that distracts him from Hajj.

361,His wife does not want to fast,"Question My dear brother is a devoted muslim and is fasting in the month of ramadan, ilhamdiallah, but his wife who is muslim does not practise nor does she recognise the month of ramadan. He has no family near him, and is finding it hard to influence her to change or to get on the right path. He prays to Allah (swt) to guide her and give him patience, but he feels as though she is on a different path or does not want to know any better about what being a muslim is about. Can you please let me know what he can do to guide her better or make her become a more devout muslim.","Praise be to Allah.What your brother should do is strive his utmost to guide his wife to the path of truth. He should use all methods of exhortation and warning, reminding her of Allah and His rights, and pointing out the danger of what she is doing. Then he should strive to find her good friends, even if they are from among his relatives, such as putting her in touch with righteous wives of his friends, who can bring her useful tapes and pamphlets. If she obeys him, this is what he wants, otherwise there is no reason why he should not use such methods as forsaking her, if that will be useful in this situation. If forsaking is prescribed with regard to the husband’s rights, perhaps it is even more appropriate with regard to the rights of Allaah. It is narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: ‘Climb up.’ I said: ‘I cannot do it.’ They said: ‘We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: ‘What are these voices?’ They said: ‘This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: ‘Who are these?’ They said: ‘These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so.’” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, no. 7796; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. If this is the punishment for the one who breaks his fast before it is time, then what about the one who does not fast at all? If, in addition to not fasting, your wife does not pray at all, then she is beyond the pale of Islam, according to the correct scholarly view. Based on that, it is not permissible for your brother to remain married to her. And Allaah knows best. See also question no. 12828."
362,Stipulating Conditions in Marriage Contracts in Islam: Allowed?,"Question I am a young man who is engaged and is going to get married. I've heard that at the time of the marriage contract, the wife can stipulate conditions in the contract. My question is: what are the limits of these conditions? What happens if the conditions are broken? Is it possible to give the wife herself the right to divorce (talaq) if I break these conditions? Is it possible for the condition to be, for example, that I will not take another wife and in the event that I do take another wife she will be divorced from me? I hope you can advise and explain this matter in detail. May Allah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allah.Stipulating conditions in marriage contracts in Islam: Permissible? The basic principle with regard to the conditions stipulated by both partners in the marriage contract is that it is a valid condition that must be fulfilled, and it is not permissible to break it. The proof is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The condition which most deserves to be fulfilled is that by means of which intimacy becomes permissible for you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2721) and Muslim (1418). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The basic principle with regard to conditions in the marriage contract is that they are valid, unless there is proof to show that they are not valid . The evidence for that is the general meaning of the evidence which speaks of fulfilling covenants: “O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations” [al-Maidah 5:1] “And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily, the covenant will be questioned about” [al-Isra 17:34] And in the hadith narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) it says: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions, except a condition that forbids what is permissible or permits what is forbidden.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1352). And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever stipulates a condition that is not in the Book of Allah it is not valid, even if he stipulates a hundred times.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2155) and Muslim (1504). To sum up, the basic principle with regard to conditions is that they are permissible and valid, whether they are to do with marriage, buying and selling, renting, pledges or mortgages, or awqaf. The ruling on the conditions that are stipulated in contracts, if they are valid, is that they must be fulfilled, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations” [al-Maidah 5:1].” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/241 (Egyptian edition) For examples of that, please see the answers to questions number 20757 and 10343 Stipulating not to take a second wife: Permissible? With regard to the woman stipulating that the husband should not take a second wife, the opinion of some scholars is that this condition is permissible, and if the husband breaks it, the wife has the right to annul the marriage and take her dues in full. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If he stipulates that he will not take her out of her house or her city, or that he will not travel with her or will not take another wife, then he is obliged to fulfil that, and if he does not do so, then she has the right to annul the marriage. This was narrated from ‘Umar, Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas and ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with them).” (Al-Mughni, 9/483) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If she stipulates that he should not take another wife, this is permissible. Some of the scholars said that it is not permissible, because it is restricting the husband in something that Allah has permitted to him, and it is contrary to the Quran in which it says (interpretation of the meaning): “then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four” [al-Nisa 4:3]. It may be said in response to that that she has a reason to ask him not to marry another wife and she is not transgressing against anyone. The husband himself is the one who is giving up his right; if he has the right to marry more than one, he is giving it up. So what is to prevent this condition being valid? Hence the correct view with regard to this matter is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), which is that this condition is valid.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/243) It should be noted that if the husband breaks this condition, his wife does not become divorced as a result of that, rather she has the right to annul the marriage , and she may either annul it or give up the condition and accept what her husband has done, and remain as his wife. Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: “Among other conditions that are valid in marriage is if she stipulates that he should not take another wife. If he fulfills the condition (all well and good), otherwise she has the right to annul the marriage because of the hadith, “The condition which most deserves to be fulfilled is that by means of which intimacy becomes permissible for you.” Similarly, if she stipulates that he should not separate her from her children or parents, this condition is valid and if he breaks it, she has the right to annul the marriage. If she stipulates that her mahr should be increased or that it should be in a specific currency, the condition is valid and binding, and he has to fulfill it, and she has the right of annulment if it is broken. In that case, she has the choice and may decide any time she wants and may annul it whenever she wants, so long as there is nothing on her part to indicate that she accepts it if she knows that he has gone against what was stipulated; in that case she would no longer have the option. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the one who he ruled was obliged to fulfill what his wife had stipulated, when the man said, “Divorce us in that case,” ‘Umar said: It is a must to fulfill the conditions, because of the hadith, “The believers are bound by their conditions.” Al-‘Allamah Ibn al-Qayyim said: It is obligatory to fulfil these conditions which are the most deserving of being fulfilled. This is what is implied by shari’ah, reason and sound analogy, if the woman did not agree to become a man's wife except on these conditions, and if it were not obligatory to fulfil them, then the marriage contract would not be based on mutual agreement, and it would be making something obligatory upon her that Allah and His Messenger have not made obligatory.” (Al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi (2/345, 346) And Allah knows best."
363,"A family adopted him because his family were bad people, and they gave him their name; what are the consequences of that?","Question I am fifteen years old. I was adopted by an Afghan family when I was six months old, because my parents were bad people and they were not raising me properly. My name has been changed, but I was not breastfed by my adoptive mother. Does that mean that she is not a mahram to me and that she should not appear before me? What are the rulings in my situation?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: At the beginning of Islam, adoption was permissible and the adopted child would be named after the one who adopted him. Then Allah, may He be exalted, forbade it and ordained that everyone should be named after his (biological) father. Allah, may He be exalted, said (interpretation of the meaning): “nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. That is but your saying with your mouths. But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the (Right) Way. Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah. But if you know not their fathers (names, call them) your brothers in faith and Mawaleekum (your freed slaves). And there is no sin on you if you make a mistake therein, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:4-5]. It is not known that there was ever any difference of opinion among the scholars concerning this ruling. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (10/121, 122): Islam forbids adoption and deems all its consequences to be invalid. That is because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons” [al-Ahzaab 33:4] and “Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers” [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. Adoption was known among the Arabs during the Jaahiliyyah and after Islam came. During the Jaahiliyyah, if a man admired another’s man strength and looks, he would take him as a son and give him his name, and give him the share of one of his own sons in terms of inheritance, and he would be attributed to him as “So and so [the adopted son] the son of So and so [the adoptive father].” The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) adopted Zayd ibn Haarithah before Allah honoured him with the message, and he used to be called “Zayd ibn Muhammad”. This is how it remained until the words of Allah, may He be exalted, were revealed: “nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons... And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:4-5]. Thus Allah abolished the system of adoption and instructed those who had adopted someone not to attribute him to himself; rather he was to be attributed to his (biological) father, if he had a father who was known. If his father was unknown, he was to be called “mawla” or a “brother in faith”. Thus the people were forbidden to change realities, and the rights of inheritance were prevented from being lost or reduced. End quote. Based on that, that family must hasten to set straight that which they had done wrong. They have to cancel your attribution to them in official papers and documents, and they must set things straight in accordance with sharee‘ah. That is to be done by testifying to your real lineage and confirming that with documentation to that effect. The fact that the parents are bad people is not an excuse to deny one’s blood relationship to them. From this you will know the answer to the basic issue of the question, which is that if a family adopts a male or a female, there is no blood relationship between them as a result of that adoption. Based on that, they are non-mahrams and it is not permissible to interact with them as families interact, according to the rulings. The woman who adopted you is a non-mahram to you, and it is not permissible for you to see her, let alone touch her or kiss her when you are not a mahram to her or to her daughters. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) married the ex-wife of his adopted son Zayd – namely Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) after Zayd divorced her. This was a practical application on the part of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of the ruling that annulled the effects of adoption. Yes, if that woman who adopted a child breastfed the adopted child five times before the age of two years, then he would become a son to her through breastfeeding, and her husband would become a father to him through breastfeeding, and their children would all become brothers and sisters to him through breastfeeding. But as that did not happen – according to what you say – then that woman is a non-mahram to you, and she must observe hijab before you and interact with you as a non-mahram woman would. You should honour that family and take an interest in their affairs and keep in touch with them, because of the favour they have done to you. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 4696, 6102 and 95216. And Allah knows best."
364,Ruling on selling phone credit worth 10 pounds for 12 pounds,"Question What is the ruling on transferring cell phone credit, where the seller transfers 10 pounds of credit for 12 pounds? We have heard that this is riba (usury), so what is the ruling on that?","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the one who has credit on his phone to sell it to someone else, for the same as it is worth, or for less or more, because this comes under the heading of selling benefits or usage, and it is not selling money for money, such that it is stipulated that the amounts be equal. So the seller or owner of the credit owns a usage or benefit of making phone calls, the value of which is 10 pounds, and it is permissible for him to sell it for 12 pounds, and there is nothing wrong with that. The same also applies to selling phone cards; it is permissible for one who owns a card worth 100 to sell it for more or less than that. And Allah knows best."

Everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah created Adam in his form, sixty cubits tall… and everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam, sixty cubits tall…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5873; Muslim, 7092 With regard to their ages, they will all enter Paradise at the age of strength and youth, thirty-three years old. It was narrated from Mu’aadh ibn Jabal that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will enter Paradise hairless, beardless with their eyes anointed with kohl, aged thirty or thirty-three years.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2545. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7928 It was also narrated by Ahmad (8505) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), with the words “thirty three years old”, with no doubt.

366,Ruling on taking lightly the matter of ruling in accordance with the sharee’ah of Allaah and not applying it,"Question Many Muslims take lightly the matter of ruling according to something other than the sharee’ah of Allaah. Some believe that taking this matter lightly does not have any impact on their adherence to Islam, and others think it is permissible to rule according to something other then that which Allaah has revealed and do not care about the consequences of that. What is the ruling on this?.","Praise be to Allah. This matter is subject to further discussion, which is that the one who rules according to something other than that which Allaah has revealed, knowing that it is obligatory to rule according to that which Allaah has revealed and that he is going against sharee’ah, but he thinks that this is permissible and that there is nothing wrong with it and that it is permissible for him to rule according to something other than the sharee’ah of Allaah, is a kaafir in the sense of major kufr, according to all scholars. This applies to ruling in accordance with man-made laws which have been invented by men, be they Christians or Jews or anyone else, if he claims that it is permissible to rule according to them, or that they are better than the rulings of Allaah, or that they are equal to the rulings of Allaah, and that man has the choice: if he wishes he may rule according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and if he wishes he may rule according to man-made laws. The one who believes that is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus, as stated above. But if a person rules according to something other than that which Allaah has revealed because of his whims and desires or because of some worldly interest he may achieve, knowing that he is disobeying Allaah and His Messenger, and that he is committing a great evil and that what he should do is rule according to the laws of Allaah, he is not guilty of major kufr because of that, but he has committed a great evil, major sin and minor kufr, as stated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid and other scholars, and he has committed thereby a lesser form of kufr, wrongdoing and evil, but it is not major kufr. This is the view of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And so judge (you O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) among them by what Allaah has revealed” [al-Maa’idah 5:49] “And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers — of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allaah’s Laws)” [al-Maa’idah 5:44] “And whosoever does not judge by that which Allaah has revealed, such are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers — of a lesser degree)” [al-Maa’idah 5:45] “And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed (then) such (people) are the Fâsiqûn [the rebellious i.e. disobedient (of a lesser degree)] to Allaah” [al-Maa’idah 5:47] “But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission” [al-Nisa’ 4:65] “Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith” [al-Maa’idah 5:50]. So the rule of Allaah is the best of rules, and it is the one that must be followed; in it are the best interests of the ummah and its happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, and the best interests of the entire world, but most people are unaware of that. Allaah is the One Whose help we seek, and there is no power and no strength except with Allaah, the Most High, the Most Great. End quote. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz."
367,Ruling on selling silver riyals for paper riyals at different rates,Question What is the ruling on selling silver riyals for paper riyals at different rates?.,"Praise be to Allah.There is some confusion concerning this matter. Some modern scholars were certain that this is permissible, because paper money is something other than silver. Others said that it is haraam, because paper money is currency that is common among people, and it has taken the place of silver, so it comes under the same rulings. As for my own view, at present I am not sure of either opinion, but I think that to be on the safe side it is better not to do that, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps away from ambiguous matters is protecting his religion and his honour.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Righteousness is a good attitude and sin is that which makes you uncomfortable and you do not want people to see you doing it.” So in order to be on the safe side it is better to sell silver coins for something else, such as gold etc, then buy paper money with that. If the one who has paper money wants to buy silver coins he should sell the paper for gold etc., then use that to buy the silver coins he wants."

I said: Yes. I went to the car’s owner and told him: I have a customer for you, but I want a broker fee without my friend finding out.

369,Burying one who neglected prayer with the Muslims,"Question In our country the Muslims are buried in a graveyard of their own, but anyone who bears the label of “Muslim” may be buried there, and most of them were people who did not pray or observe the limits set down by the religion. What should be done when visiting these graves in which there is no distinction between true Muslims and those who were not Muslim? What about me, if I die and am buried with people who did not pray? Can I leave instructions that I am to be buried with people who did pray, or what should I do? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allah.Muslims have to have graveyards of their own, in which no one else should be buried. The person who does not pray and who dies when he is a person who has neglected prayer should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard, because the one who does not pray and denies that it is an obligation is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus. If he does not pray out of laziness, then he is a kaafir according to the more correct scholarly view. It is prescribed in Islam for a Muslim to leave instructions that he should be buried in the Muslim graveyard if there is also a non-Muslim graveyard in the vicinity, lest he be buried with the non-Muslims. And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."
370,Response to some misunderstandings of the texts which make the questioner think that the Qur’an is not preserved,"Question I read a hadith in which ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I used to recite “Famdu ila dhikr Allah” instead of “Fas ‘aw ila dhikr Allah” (“come to the remembrance of Allah” [al-Jumu‘ah 62:9]) in Soorat al-Jumu‘ah. (ad-Durr al-Manthoor, part 6, p. 219) And I have read other hadiths which indicate that the Qur’an is not complete, such as the hadith of ‘Umar in as-Saqeefah [when the Sahaabah met after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to decide who would lead the ummah], when he said: The Qur’an was 102,700 letters. (al-Itqaan by as-Suyooti, p. 88) And his words: No one should claim that the Qur’an is complete, because most of it has been lost. (Tafseer ad-Durr al-Manthoor by as-Suyooti, vol. 1, p. 104) And Ubayy ibn Ka‘b said that in his Mus-haf there were two additional soorahs, al-Khal‘ and al-Hafd (al-Itqaan by as-Suyooti, vol. 2, p. 66) Sayyid Anwar Shah Kashmiri said: My analysis is based on what it says in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, that some words in the Qur’an have been distorted, deliberately or otherwise, according to the testimony of ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him). (Fayd al-Baari, vol. 3, p. 395, under the heading Shahaadaat (testimonies). As-Suyooti narrated from ‘Uthmaan in his Itqaan (vol. 1, p. 174) that he said: There are some mistakes in the Mus-haf that we have today. Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah said: I asked ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about grammatical mistakes in [the original text of] the Qur’an, “Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all that was revealed to him from Allah), those who are the Jews and the Sabians…” [al-Maa’idah 5:69], “and those who perform AsSalat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat” [an-Nisa’ 4:162] and “Verily! These are two magicians” [Ta-Ha 20:63]. She said: O son of my sister, this is the work of the scribes; they made a mistake in writing. (al-Itqaan, vol. 1, p. 183, 184) Jalaal ad-Deen as-Suyooti said concerning it that it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Similarly, it was narrated in ad-Durr al-Manthoor (vol. 5, p. 180) and al-Itqaan (vol. 2, p. 25) that at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), Soorat al-Ahzaab was 200 verses, then it was reduced to its current length, after ‘Uthmaan collected the Mus-haf. And there is the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah: Among the things that were revealed of the Qur’an was that ten definite breastfeedings make a person a mahram, then that was abrogated and replaced with five definite breastfeedings, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away when this was among the things that were recited of the Qur’an.. Narrated by Muslim in Kitaab ar-Radaa‘ah. How can we say, after all this, that the Qur’an is preserved?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: With regard to ‘Umar’s recitation of the verse in Soorat al-Jumu‘ah as “Famdu ila dhikr Allah”, this was narrated from him by Imam al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh in an affirmative mu‘allaq report. It was also narrated by Imam Ibn Jareer at-Tabari with a saheeh isnaad. It is not in accordance with the format of the ‘Uthmaani Mus-haf, and it is not one of the seven modes of recitation. Some of the scholars are of the view that it is to be regarded as another way of reciting the verse. Others are of the view that it is an explanatory recitation, and that what he meant was to explain the meaning of the word “Fas‘aw” in the verse, and that it does not mean walking rapidly. Something similar to this was found in the Mus-hafs of some of the Sahaabah. They used to explain the meaning of some of the words in the verse, and some of their students narrated it as if it were one way of reciting the verse. However, what appears more likely to be the case is that this was the recitation of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), and is how he recited the verse, as the isnaad going back to him is sound. But that does not mean that it is an alternative to the verse that the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) unanimously agreed to write in the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan, which was definitely narrated by means of tawaatur. Rather it is a mode of recitation according to which ‘Umar used to recite, whilst not rejecting the others. What is written in the Mus-haf is another mode of recitation for the verse, and both are acceptable, but what is written in the Mus-hafs is that which is definitely proven. Secondly: With regard to your mentioning hadith of ‘Umar in as-Saqeefah [when the Sahaabah met after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to decide who would lead the ummah], when he said: The Qur’an was 102,700 letters. (al-Itqaan by as-Suyooti, p. 88), this involves a mistake and deceit. As for the mistake, it is in the writing of the number of letters, because what is narrated concerning the number thereof is one million and twenty-seven thousand letters. As for the deceit, it is your mentioning the text by adding the word “was” to give the impression that there is something lacking in the Qur’an, and by mentioning the hadith in such a way as to give the impression that as-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated this and supported it or classed it as saheeh, which is contrary to the facts. Rather the report from ‘Umar is fabricated, and as-Suyooti himself criticised its isnaad, quoting adh-Dhahabi’s criticism of it. Adh-Dhahabi said concerning the hadith in Mizaan al-I‘tidaal (3/639): It is a false report. And Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani agreed with him in Lisaan al-Mizaan (5/276). There was no need to explain the hadith if this was the case. As for its text, it is extremely munkar (odd), because the number of letters in the Qur’an has not been mentioned in any proven hadith, and that was not the practice of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). As-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: at-Tabaraani narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab in a marfoo‘ report: “The Qur’an is one million and twenty-seven thousand letters. Whoever reads it with patience and seeking reward with Allah will have for every letter a wife from among al-hoor al-‘iyn.” The men of its isnaad are thiqaat (trustworthy) apart from the shaykh of at-Tabaraani, Muhammad ibn ‘Ubayd ibn Adam ibn Abi Iyaas, whom adh-Dhahabi criticised because of this hadith. End quote from al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1/242, 243) Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The signs of fabrication in his hadith are clear. In the case of such a report, there is no need to quote anything about the criticism thereof more than what al-Haafiz adh-Dhahabi, followed by al-‘Asqallaani, indicated, that among his reports are hadiths such as this one, of which he was the only narrator! End quote from Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da‘eefah wa’l-Mawdoo‘ah (9/71) Concerning the issue of counting the letters of the Qur’an, as-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: as-Sakhkhaawi said: I do not know of any benefit in counting the number of words and letters, because if that were of any benefit, the benefit would only be in a book in which it is possible to add and subtract, and it is not possible to do that in the case of the Qur’an. End quote from al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1/242). Thirdly: With regard to your saying: And his words: No one should claim that the Qur’an is complete, because most of it has been lost. (Tafseer ad-Durr al-Manthoor by as-Suyooti, vol. 1, p. 104), The response to that is as follows: There is no source for this sentence in this wording in as-Suyooti’s book al-Itqaan or in any other book of the Muslims. The source for this sentence was narrated by Sa‘eed ibn Mansoor in his Tafseer, where he said: Ismaa‘eel ibn Ibraaheem told us, from Ayyoob, from Naafi‘, from Ibn ‘Umar who said: No one of you should say: I have learned all of the Qur’an, for how does he know what all of it is? He may have missed many verses of the Qur’an. Rather let him say: We learned what is apparent to us of it. End quote. What is meant by the words of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) is that no one can be certain that he has memorised everything that was revealed of the Qur’an, because there are some verses that were revealed and then taken away, which is what is called abrogation of verses. Ibn ‘Umar himself stated that clearly when he said: It was disliked for a man to say, I have read all of the Qur’an, for there is some Qur’an that has been taken away. This is seen in the report of Ibn ad-Darrees from him. Hence this report was narrated by Imam Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam, who included it in a chapter entitled: Chapter of what was taken away of the Qur’an after its revelation, and was not written in the Mus-hafs. As-Suyooti also mentioned it in his book al-Itqaan, in the chapter entitled: Chapter on the Abrogation of Verses. For further clarification, please see the answers to questions no. 110237 and 105746 Fourthly: With regard to your saying: And Ubayy ibn Ka‘b said that in his Mus-haf there were two additional soorahs, al-Khal‘ and al-Hafd (al-Itqaan by as-Suyooti, vol. 2, p. 66), What is referred to by the name Soorat al-Khala‘ is the words: “In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. O Allah, verily we seek Your help and Your forgiveness, and we praise You and we are not ungrateful to You. And we disavow and disown anyone who opposes You.” And what is referred to by the name Soorat al-Hafd is the words: “In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. O Allah, You alone we worship, to You we pray and prostrate, and for Your sake we work and strive. We hope for Your mercy and fear Your punishment, for Your punishment will inevitably befall the disbelievers.” What is meant by the phrase “and for Your sake we work and strive” is: we strive to obey You. With regard to the notion that these two soorahs were in the Mus-haf of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, yes, that may have been the case, but not on the grounds that they were part of the Qur’an that took its final shape the last time Jibreel reviewed it with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), because the Mus-hafs of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) contained commentary and explanations, and contained verses that had been abrogated. These two soorahs were part of what had been revealed of the Qur’an, then their verses were abrogated, but some of the Sahaabah continued to recite them in their Qunoot, because of what they contained of supplication and praise of Allah. Whoever wants to know the final shape that the Qur’an took should understand that what is in the Mus-haf that was compiled by Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, then by ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with them) is what is preserved, written and precise, and it does not contain these two soorahs. Therefore no one recites them in prayer, and no commentary was mentioned concerning them, and there is no report of different modes of reciting them. The fact that they were two soorahs then were abrogated is the view of as-Suyooti himself. As-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Husayn ibn al-Munaadi said in his book an-Naasikh wa’l-Mansookh: Among the things that were abrogated from the Qur’an but were not taken away from people’s memories are the two soorahs of al-Qunoot in Witr, which are called Soorat al-Khal‘ and Soorat al-Hafd. End quote from al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (2/68). Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shinqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Examples of abrogation of the Qur’an by the Sunnah include: the abrogation of the verse which mentions ten breastfeedings and the connected ruling by the mutawaatir reports of the Sunnah; and the abrogation of Soorat al-Khal ‘ and Soorat al-Hafd, both verses and rulings, by the mutawaatir reports of the Sunnah. Soorat al-Khal ‘ and Soorat al-Hafd compose Qunoot in Fajr prayer according to the Maalikis. The author of ad-Durr al-Manthoor – namely as-Suyooti – and others were of the view that they were two soorahs of the Book of Allah, then they were abrogated. End quote from Adwa’ al-Bayaan (2/451) The recitation of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b was narrated from him by Naafi‘, Ibn Katheer, Abu ‘Amr and others, and it does not contain Soorat al-Hafd and al-Khal‘. Moreover, his Mus-haf was in harmony with the Mus-haf of the Muslims. Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari said: I saw the Mus-haf of Anas in Basrah, with some of his descendants, and I found it to be exactly like the Mus-haf of the Muslims. The descendants of Anas narrated that it was the handwriting of Anas and the dictation of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b. End quote. All of this is assuming that the report from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, saying that he regarded these two supplications as being two soorahs, is sound. However, there is strong reason to doubt that, because that was not narrated from him with a saheeh isnaad. To sum up the response to this claim: either it is not soundly narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, and whoever claims that it is should produce his sound isnaad going back to him; or, assuming that it is sound, it is part of the Qur’an that was abrogated but the wording remains, and as it is words of praise and supplication, it is valid to recite it in Qunoot. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeem az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The author of al-Intisaar stated: With regard to the words of al-Qunoot which were reported to have been written in the Mus-haf of Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, there is no proof that they are Qur’an that was revealed; rather it is a kind of supplication. If these words were Qur’an, they would have been transmitted to us as Qur’an and it would be known that they were soundly narrated. Then he said: It may be that some of it is words that were Qur’an that was revealed, then it was abrogated, and it was permitted to recite these words in supplication and mix them with words that are not Qur’an. But that was not narrated soundly from him; rather it was narrated from him that he wrote it in his Mus-haf. He wrote in his Mus-haf words that were not Qur’an, such as supplication or explanation. End quote. This supplication is the Qunoot that was adopted by the Hanafi scholars. Some of them stated that Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote them in his Mus-haf and called it Soorat al-Khal‘ and al-Hafd, because these words appear in these passages, and they were known by these names. Conclusion: Some of the Sahaabah who wrote down the Qur’an for themselves in a book (mus-haf) that was for their own use may have written in it things that were not Qur’an, but were commentaries on some of the meanings of the Qur’an that were not clear to them, or supplications that were recited like the supplications of the Qur’an, in the sense that it is valid to recite them in prayer, for Qunoot and the like, and they knew that all of that was not Qur’an, but the scarcity of writing materials and the fact that they were writing down the Qur’an for themselves only, and not for others, led them to take this matter lightly, because they were confident that they would not become confused and mix the Qur’an with other words. Then some short-sighted people thought that everything they had written in these books had been written down on the basis that it was Qur’an, even though in fact that was not the case; rather it was what we have explained. End quote from Manaahil al-‘Irfaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (1/271) See the article entitled Fayd ar-Rabb fi’r-Radd ‘ala Man idda‘a anna hunaaka Sooratayn Zaa’idatayn fi Mus-haf Ubayy ibn Ka‘b. Fifthly: With regard to your saying: Sayyid Anwar Shah Kashmiri said: My analysis is based on what it says in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, that some words in the Qur’an have been distorted, deliberately or otherwise, according to the testimony of ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him). (Fayd al-Baari, vol. 3, p. 395, under the heading Shahaadaat (testimonies), Unfortunately we have to say that this is a lie for which there is no basis, either from Sayyid Anwar or from anyone else among the Muslim scholars! Sixthly: With regard to your saying: As-Suyooti narrated from ‘Uthmaan in his Itqaan (vol. 1, p. 174) that he said: There are some mistakes in the Mus-haf that we have today, This is not what he said, and nothing to this effect has been narrated from ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) or anyone else among the Sahaabah. If it were soundly narrated, it would have a valid meaning. We have explained this in detail in the answer to question no. 135752, q.v. Seventhly: With regard to your saying: Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah said: I asked ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about grammatical mistakes in [the original text of] the Qur’an, “Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and all that was revealed to him from Allah), those who are the Jews and the Sabians…” [al-Maa’idah 5:69], “and those who perform AsSalat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat” [an-Nisa’ 4:162] and “Verily! These are two magicians” [Ta-Ha 20:63]. She said: O son of my sister, this is the work of the scribes; they made a mistake in writing. (al-Itqaan, vol. 1, p. 183, 184) Jalaal ad-Deen as-Suyooti said concerning it that it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), This report is not correct and cannot be soundly narrated from her. This has been explained in the answer to question no. 135752. Eighthly: With regard to your saying: Similarly, it was narrated in ad-Durr al-Manthoor (vol. 5, p. 180) and al-Itqaan (vol. 2, p. 25) that at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), Soorat al-Ahzaab was 200 verses, then it was reduced to its current length, after ‘Uthmaan collected the Mus-haf, this wording may give the impression that there is distortion! However the correct wording was narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh (10/273) and al-Haakim in his Mustadrak (2/450), from Zirr from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, who said: Soorat al-Ahzaab was equivalent in length to Soorat al-Baqarah, and in it were the words, “If an old man and an old woman commit zina, stone them both.” A similar report was narrated by an-Nasaa’i in al-Kubra (4/271, 272). This is among the verses that were abrogated , as we have already pointed out that and confirmed that this is a type of abrogation that occurred. Ninthly: With regard to your saying: And there is the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah: Among the things that were revealed of the Qur’an was that ten definite breastfeedings make a person a mahram, then that was abrogated and replaced with five definite breastfeedings, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away when this was among the things that were recited of the Qur’an.. Narrated by Muslim in Kitaab ar-Radaa‘ah, This is saheeh, and this report includes both types of abrogation, the first of which is abrogation of both verse and ruling. This was in the abrogated verse, which spoke of a person being made a mahram by means of ten breastfeedings. The second type is abrogation of the verse but not the ruling, which refers to the abrogated verse which spoke of a person being made a mahram by means of five breastfeedings. Although the verse was taken away and no longer exists, it contained the sound shar‘i ruling which is indicated by the Sunnah. All that we may understand from the words of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), “and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away when this was among the things that were recited of the Qur’an” is that the abrogation of this verse came so late that news of its abrogation did not reach some of them, but the fact that this verse is not found in any of the copies of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) indicates that it is not part of the Qur’an in its final shape. Therefore no wording of the verse is known, let alone any mode of recitation or interpretation thereof. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘Aa’ishah’s words, “and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed away when this was among the things that were recited of the Qur’an” mean that the abrogation and replacement with the ruling of five breastfeedings was revealed so late that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) died, some people were still reciting the verse that mentioned five breastfeedings and they still regarded it as Qur’an to be recited, as news of the abrogation had not reached them, because it had happened so recently. But when news of the abrogation reached them after that, they recanted it and were unanimously agreed that it is not to be recited. Abrogation is of three types: 1. abrogation of the ruling and the verses, as in the case of the ten breastfeedings 2. abrogation of the verse but not the ruling, as in the case of the five breastfeedings, and the old man and old woman, who are to be stoned if they commit zina 3. abrogation of the ruling but not the verse, which is the most common kind, and includes the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives…” [al-Baqarah 2:240]. End quote from Sharh Muslim (10/29) See also the answer to question no. 175355 Tenthly: With regard to your saying: How can we say, after all this, that the Qur’an is preserved? The response to that is: Yes, we do say that with all confidence. The Qur’an is indeed protected and preserved by Allah, may He be exalted, and whoever doubts that is one of the disbelievers in whose heart there is not even an atom’s worth of faith. See a detailed discussion of that in the answer to question no. 129170. And Allah knows best."
371,What is the ruling on buying from the kuffaar when there are Muslims around?,Question What is the ruling on Muslims who do not cooperate with one another because they do not want to buy from Muslims and they prefer to buy from the kuffaar’s stores? Is this halaal or haraam?,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that it is permissible for a Muslim to buy what he needs of that which Allaah has permitted from a Muslim or from a kaafir. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) boughtfrom Jews. But when a Muslim chooses not to buy from his Muslim brother for no reason, i.e., he has not been cheated or deceived, and the goods are not of poor quality, and he simply prefers to buy from a kaafir rather than from a Muslim with no justification – this is haraam, because it weakens the trade of the Muslims and makes them lose sales if this becomes a habit among the Muslim (consumers). But if he does not buy from him for a reason such as those mentioned above, then he should advise his Muslim brother to give up the bad things he is doing. If he accepts the advice, then praise be to Allaah, otherwise he should leave him alone and go to someone else, even if he is a kaafir, if he is honest and the transactions are to the mutual benefit of both parties."

And, does a sister have to be covered (full hijab) when reading it?","Praise be to Allah.It is not obligatory for a woman to put on hijab in order to read the Quran, because there is no evidence to indicate that this is obligatory. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said that reciting the Quran does not require covering the head. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in his comments on sujud al-tilawah (prostration required when reading certain verses of the Quran): “Sujud al-tilawah is to be done when reading the Quran. It may be done in any state, even with the head uncovered , etc., because this prostration is not subject to the rulings on prayer.” (Fatawa al-Jami’ah li’l-mar-ah al-Muslimah, 1/249) “With regard to reading Quran, it is not permissible for one who is in a state of janabah (impurity following sexual activity) to read Quran either from the Mus-haf or otherwise until he has done ghusl, because it was narrated that nothing prevented the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from reading Quran except janabah. But if a person has broken his wudu (minor impurity), then it is permissible for him to recite the Quran from memory because of the general meaning of the evidence.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/150) It is better, and is mustahabb, to do wudu before reciting, because this Quran is the Word of Allah. So it is better to do wudu before reading it as a sign of respect. But touching the Mus-haf is not permissible unless one has done wudu, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Which (that Book with Allah) none can touch but the purified.” [Al-Waqi’ah 56:79] (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/150) With regard to women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, please see Question no. 2564 . And Allah knows best."
373,Wishing for death because of intense distress,Question I have great problems in my work and in my social life. Is it permissible for me to wish for death?,"Praise be to Allah.Your state is like that described by the poet: “If death were for sale I would buy it. This life is something in which there is nothing good.” This is wrong. It is not permissible for the believer to wish for death. If he has to say something, then let him recite the du’aa’ that has been reported for such cases. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Let not any one of you wish for death because of some harm that has befallen him. If he must wish for something then let him say, ‘O Allaah, keep me alive so long as life is good for me, and let me die when death is good for me.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari (al-Fath), 11/154)"
374,The kaafir’s reckoning in the Hereafter,"Question The believer will face his reckoning on the Day of Resurrection, whether his deeds are good or bad. But how will the reckoning of the kaafir be, when he is not required to observe the same duties as the believer?","Praise be to Allah. This question is based on a misconception, for the same requirements are demanded of the kaafir as of the believer, but he is not obliged to do them in this world. The indication that he is subject to the same requirements is to be found in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Except those on the Right (i.e. the pious true believers of Islamic Monotheism). In Gardens (Paradise) they will ask one another, About Al‑Mujrimoon (polytheists, criminals, disbelievers) (and they will say to them): ‘What has caused you to enter Hell’ They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers), Nor we used to feed Al‑Miskeen (the poor); And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allaah hated) with vain talkers. And we used to belie the Day of Recompense’” [al-Muddaththir 74:39-46] If their suffering were not due to the fact that they did not pray or feed the poor, they would not mention these things. This indicates that they will be punished concerning (neglect of) the minor issues of Islam. This is based on the texts but it is also the matter of common sense, for if Allaah will punish His believing slave for what he failed to do with regard to religious obligations, how can He not punish His disbelieving slave? Rather I could add that the kaafir will be punished for everything that Allaah has blessed him with in this world, his food, drink, etc. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate (in the past), if they fear Allaah (by keeping away from His forbidden things), and believe and do righteous good deeds, and again fear Allaah and believe, and once again fear Allaah and do good deeds with Ihsaan (perfection). And Allaah loves the good‑doers” [al-Maa'idah 5:93] The apparent meaning of the aayah is that the believers are relieved of any blame for what they eat, and it may be understood that the kaafirs are to blame for what they eat. Similarly Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves, and At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) things] of food?’ Say: ‘They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them)’” [al-A’raaf 7:32] The phrase “They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe” indicates that people other than the believers do not have any right to enjoy them. I say that they do not have any shar’i right to them, but the reality of this life is that Allaah has created these things and the kaafirs are benefitting from them, and this is something that cannot be denied. This indicates that the kaafir will be brought to account even for the permissible things that he ate and for what he wore. This is based on the texts but it is also the matter of common sense, for how can it make sense that this kaafir who disobeys Allaah and does not believe in Him should have the right to enjoy that which Allaah has created and blessed His slaves with? If this is clear to you, (then you will see that) the kaafir will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection for his deeds, but the way in which the kaafir will be brought to account will not be like the way in which the believer is brought to account, because the reckoning of the believer will be easy, and his Lord will speak to him alone, and will make him admit to his sins, then He will say to him, “I concealed your sins in the world and I forgive you for them today.” But as for the kaafir – we seek refuge with Allaah – his reckoning will mean that he will confess to his sins and be humiliated before all the people, “and the witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord!” No doubt! the Curse of Allaah is on the Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, oppressors)”"
375,He goes out to call people to Allah and leaves his family despite their need for him,"Question I am a Swedish revert to Islam, Alhamdulillah. Me and my husband live with our 3 children ages 7,2 and 1 years old in my country, Sweden. My husband has recently started to go out with the Tabligh even though I objected to it because he is needed at home. My family are non Muslims and I do not see them often, my husband's family doesn't live here and yet he has no problem going away every month for some days for what he calls Khuruj. I have asked him if he at least could stay in our town and maybe do i'tikaf, one night at a time, but it is at least 3 days. Could you please explain what does it mean, is it from the Sunnah? Because every time I ask he says I cannot object, and he leaves me and our children with Allah to look after and he tells me the story of Ibrahim ('alayhi as-salam) when he left Hagar in the desert. I think with our circumstances, living where we are, there is so much fitna I do not even take the bus inside the city and many things happens at night in our neighbourhood, so is it right of him to leave us like this and should I be confident when he says he leave us with Allah? My husband is a good husband Alhamdulillah, although he has a hot temper. He hates fatwas, and respects the scholars but says we must see what the Quran and the Sunnah says, Alhamdulillah. Could you please advice us how to solve this and please tell us about this Khuruj in the light of Quran and Sunnah.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is no doubt that those who are most deserving of a person’s care, protection, concern, upbringing and call are his family, the members of his own household. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) …” [al-Tahreem 66:6]. And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for her flock. The slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (893) and Muslim (1829). If a man has shar‘i obligations having to do with the rights of Allah and with the rights of His creation, and he himself wants to strive in some good causes and do a lot of supererogatory deeds, then he is enjoined to strike a balance between all these rights, and he should give precedence to those which are obligatory over those which are recommended and encouraged. If he has too many duties, then he should strive to combine all these interests, whenever it is possible to do so. If there is a conflict between some of them and others, or he is not able to combine them, then he must give priority to the more important of them over others, and he should start with the most binding of obligations upon him, then move to those that are less important. It is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhari (1968) from ‘Awn ibn Abi Juhayfah, that his father said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) established the bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abu ad-Darda. Salman visited Abu ad-Darda and saw Umm ad-Darda looking umkempt. He said to her: What is the matter with you? She said: Your brother Abu ad-Darda has no need of worldly matters. Abu ad-Darda came and made some food for him. Salman said: Eat (with me). Abu ad-Darda said: I am fasting. Salman said: I will not eat until you eat – so Abu ad-Darda ate. When night came, Abu ad-Darda wentto get up (to pray) and Salman said: Sleep, so he slept. Then he went to get up again and Salman said: Sleep. Then towards the end of the night, Salman said: Now get up – and they prayed. Salman said to him: Verily your Lord has a right over you, your own self has a right over you, and your wife has a right over you, so give each one who has a right, his right. Then he came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Salman is right.” In this hadith we see that one should strike a balance between all duties, and not pay excessive attention to some at the expense of others. Secondly: A man’s care and protection of his family includes taking care of whatever they need in their lives of maintenance and accommodation, as is obligatory. That also includes protecting them from anything that may pose a danger to them, whether that has to do with their lives, their honour or their wealth. He is enjoined to take care of them and protect them in all those ways. This is something that varies from one time and place to another. If a man is in a place where his family will be safe if he leaves them, either because they are surrounded by other family members and they have someone to take care of their affairs, or because the place where they reside is generally safe, and there are few causes of fitnah there, then in that case it is permissible for him to travel and leave them, or to go out to take care of his own interests, to an extent that will not cause them any difficulty or harm. But if his family are in a place where their lives, wealth or honour are not safe, or they fear fitnah in that place, then what he must do is stay with them and not go out and leave them, except in the case of absolute necessity, in which case he must pay attention to providing means of care and protection for them, or appointing someone to look after them, or moving to another place that is more safe. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: A man came to the Prophet of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: I swear my allegiance to you, that I will migrate and engage in jihad, seeking reward from Allah. He said: “Are either of your parents alive?’ He said: Yes, both of them. He said: “Are you seeking reward from Allah?” He said: Yes. He said: “Then go back to your parents and be a good companion to them.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1671) and Muslim (2549) Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Allan as-Siddeeqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Lawgiver waived the obligation of migration in his case, giving precedence to the rights of his parents. Even though migration was obligatory for him, it conflicted with something that was more obligatory than it, namely the rights of parents. If it was not obligatory, then that which is obligatory would take precedence, but this is only applicable in the case of one whose religious commitment is safe in the place where they (his parents) are. But if he fears for his religious commitment, then he must flee for the sake of protecting it, and leave behind his parents and children, as the Muhajiroon did, who are Allah’s chosen elite among His slaves. End quote from Daleel al-Faliheen li Turuq Riyadh as-Saliheen (2/463) This has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 177195 In fact some of the scholars stated that in such a case, where a person fears that if he leaves his family alone in the place where they are they may be exposed to harm or danger, the obligation of offering prayer in congregation is waived for him, despite the fact that it quickly ends and requires little time. It says in Kashshaf al-Qina‘ (1/456): Yes, if his going to the mosque will lead to leaving his family on their own, then he must establish the prayer in his house, so as to fulfil the obligation. End quote. In fact they also stated that one of the aims of sharee‘ah, to which the man should pay attention, is keenness to give company to his family, even if that is only for a short time. It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaj (2/471): He has the choice when coming back (from Friday prayer) between riding and walking. Ash-Sharwani said in his commentary thereon: This is to be understood as meaning: unless there is something good he wants to do (in which case he should come back quickly), such as giving company to his family, or doing some religious duties concerning them, and so on, or he wants to protect his faculties from falling into sin that may be expected when one is outside the home. As that is the case: What is prescribed for the husband, if you are living in a place where you and your family are not safe, is for him to stay with the members of his household, and he can still do all the things that he wants to do of da‘wah, good deeds, prayer, and i‘tikaf. He can still do those things in the same area or city in which you are living. With regard to fulfilling these aims of sharee‘ah, it is not stipulated that they should be done in one place and not another, and they are not rituals in which it is stipulated that one should be in Makkah or Madinah. Rather they are kinds of good deeds which a person may do in the place where he is, in his own neighbourhood and city. Thus he may combine doing all kinds of good deeds with giving each one who has a right his right, and he will not be like the one who builds a castle but destroys the city. For more information, please see the answers to questions no. 177195, 155577 and 3043. Thirdly: With regard to the husband quoting the story of the Prophet of Allah Ibraheem (peace be upon him), which was narrated by al-Bukhari (3364) from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), in which it says: “Then Ibraheem brought her and her (infant) son Isma'eel, whom she was nursing, and left them beside the House (the Ka‘bah) near a tree, above Zamzam in the upper part of the mosque. At that time there was no one in Makkah, and there was no water there. He left them there, and he left with them a sack in which there were some dates, and a waterskin in which there was some water. Then Ibraheem turned to leave, and the mother of Isma‘eel followed him, saying: O Ibraheem, where are you going and leaving us in this valley, in which there is no one and nothing? She said this to him several times, but he did not pay any attention to her. Then she said to him: Is it Allah Who has commanded you to do this? He said: Yes. She said: Then He will not forsake us. Then she went back, and Ibraheem kept walking until, when he reached the mountain pass where they could not see him, he turned to face the Ka‘bah, then he offered supplication with these words, raising his hands and saying: “O Lord, ‘I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah); in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks’ [Ibraheem 14:37]” – his quoting of this story as evidence is entirely inappropriate, and has nothing to do with your story or your situation at all. Ibraheem (peace be upon him) only left his wife and son in that place, in the sacred land of Allah, beside the Sacred House of Allah, for a legitimate shar‘i purpose, based on the wisdom of Allah, that would be served by them residing in that place. The mother of Isma‘eel was not aware of the wisdom of Allah behind her staying in that place, in which there was no cultivation or water, and no people to keep her company, but she asked the Prophet of Allah Ibraheem whether he was doing that to them on the command of Allah, and he replied: Yes. So she submitted to the command of Allah and said: Then Allah will not forsake us. The one Who revealed to Ibraheem (peace be upon him) that he should do this action, which appeared to be contrary to proper conduct and what people usually do, was Allah. It was not an idea that Ibraheem (peace be upon him) came up with by himself; rather it was a revelation from Allah. Has Allah revealed to us or commanded us that one of us should fall short in protecting his family and the members of his household, then say that he was entrusting them to the care of Allah? So why did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instruct that Sahabi to go back to his parents and be kind and keep them company? Allah, may He be exalted, instructed His Close Friend Ibraheem to sacrifice his son Isma‘eel (peace be upon them both), but can it be valid – whether according to reason or religious teaching – for a man to neglect his family and children, let alone expose them to harm and danger, let alone go and sacrifice one of them, giving as his reason the fact that Ibraheem (peace be upon him) did that? Can it be valid for a man to leave his family members in the desert, in a land where there is no cultivation and no water, and leave them, then say that Ibraheem (peace be upon him) did that? But after all that, and before all that, we advise you to try to reach an understanding with your husband about this problem, in a calm manner and avoiding trying to prove him wrong. Rather you should try to avoid angering him, as much as you are able, and try to explain to him that you understand and respect his convictions, but all you are asking him to do is to pay attention to your needs and your circumstances in the place where you and your family are living, and that he should do whatever he can to have a moderate, balanced approach, and make some effort so that you do not reach the stage of tension in the relationship or exacerbation of the problems between you. We ask Allah to make things easy for you, and to make your husband treat you well and make you treat him well, and to keep you together in the best way. And Allah knows best."
376,What should one do about tahaarah (purification) if one can find neither water nor dust?,Question What should a person do if he finds no water and no dust to purify himself with? Does he have to repeat his prayer after he finds either of them?,"Praise be to Allah. Ibn Hazm said: Whoever is detained, whether he is traveling or not, in such a state that he cannot find dust or water, or he is being crucified, and the time for prayer comes, then he should pray as he is, and his prayer will be complete and does not have to be repeated, whether he finds water within the time of the prayer or after the time is over. The proof of that is the aayahs (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can” [al-Taghaabun 64:16] “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”[al-Baqarah 2:286] And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.” And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… while He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity?”[al-An’aam 6:119] From these texts we see that we are not obliged to do more than we are able to, and that if we are unable to do something, we are relieved of the obligation. We learn that Allaah has forbidden us to neglect wudoo’ or tayammum for prayer, unless we are forced “under compulsion of necessity”. The one who is deprived of water and dust is forced by necessity to do something which is forbidden, i.e., to forgo purifying himself with water or dust; so the prohibition does not apply in his case. But he is able to pray, fulfilling all the rulings on prayer and believing it to be obligatory, so it remains for him to do that which he is able to do. If he prays as we have mentioned, then he has prayed as Allaah has commanded him to do, and whoever prays as Allaah has commanded him to do is not to blame. And hastening to pray at the beginning of the time for prayer is preferable, because of what we have stated above. Abu Haneefah, Sufyaan al-Thawri and al-Oozaa’i said, concerning one who is in this situation, that he should not pray until he finds water, when he finds it."
377,Should he meet the needs of his kaafir neighbour?,"Question If I have an non Muslim neighbour and he asks me for something, should I help him?.","Praise be to Allah.That depends on what is customary; if it is customary for neighbours to meet one another’s needs, such as if one neighbour is going to the marketplace and his neighbours say to him: “Bring me such and such” – fruit or food and the like, then there is nothing wrong with doing that for his kaafir neighbour, because that is part of honouring one’s neighbour, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him honour his neighbour.” But if that is not customary, then he should see what is best. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthmaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)."
378,Can a daa‘iyah sit alone with a woman (khulwah) to teach her?,Question Can a daa‘iyah sit alone with a woman (khulwah) for teaching purposes?.,"Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible for the daa‘iyah to be alone with a woman who he is calling to Islam or teaching, because that is haraam, and the means to obedience and worship cannot be something haraam. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him)"
379,Praising of the deceased,"Question What is the ruling on people who say, when someone dies, “O (you) the one in (complete) rest and satisfaction! Come back to your Lord, - well pleased (yourself) and well-pleasing unto Him” [al-Fajr 89:27-28 – interpretation of the meaning]?","Praise be to Allah.This is not permitted if it is said concerning a specific person, because it is testifying that he is one of this category."
380,Prohibition against spying on others,"Question I work for a company and my boss has asked me to tell him what the employees are saying about him personally, despite the fact that some of what they are saying is true. Is the money that I receive in return for this spying halaal or haraam?","Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible for you to do this haraam action, because it involves nameemah (malicious gossip) and spying, and the reward you receive for this is haraam earnings. You should note that nameemah is a major sin. Nameemah means telling some people what others have said about them in order to cause trouble among them. This is the most common definition of nameemah. Ibn Hajar al-Haythami narrated it in his book al-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir, then he said: “It says in al-Ihya’: it is not limited to that, rather it refers to disclosure of anything that may hurt or offend somebody if it is disclosed, whether it is the person who is spoken about who is offended, or the person who hears the gossip, or a third party, whether it is disclosed verbally, in writing or by means of a hint or a gesture, and whether what is transmitted is an action, a word, a fault or a shortcoming in the person who is being talked about, or in someone else. The definition of nameemah is uncovering secrets and disclosing that which it is not appropriate to disclose. Hence we should keep silent and refrain from telling everything that we see of people’s situations, unless speaking of it will bring some benefit to a Muslim or ward off some harm. For example, if you see a person taking someone else’s property, you have to bear witness to that, in contrast to if you see someone hiding his own money, in which case speaking of it would be nameemah and disclosing a person’s secrets. If what is spoken of is a fault or shortcoming in the person of whom one speaks, then this is gheebah (backbiting) and nameemah (malicious gossip).” (al-Zawaajir, no. 252: al-Nameemah) It was narrated that al-Haafiz al-Mundhiri said: “The ummah is unanimously agreed that nameemah is forbidden and that it is one of the greatest sins in the sight of Allaah.” From this we know that your passing on to your boss what your colleagues say is a kind of disclosing secrets and creating mischief and falling into this major sin, in addition to it being spying, which is haraam. There are many texts which condemn nameemah and spying and seeking out people’s faults, which will deter the Muslim from committing these haraam actions: 1 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No person who spreads nameemah will enter Paradise.” According to another report, “No eavesdropper (qattaat)…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6056; Muslim, 105. A qattaat is someone who spreads nameemah. It was said that the one who spreads nameemah is the person who is with a group who are speaking, then he spreads gossip about them, and that the qattaat is the one who listens to them without them realizing, then he spreads gossip about them. 2 – In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) out of one of the gardens of Madeenah, and he heard the sounds of two people who were being tormented in their graves. He said, ‘They are being punished, not for something that was difficult to avoid, but it is nevertheless a major sin. One of them did not protect himself from urine (i.e., take measures to avoid contaminating himself or his clothes) and the other used to walk about spreading nameemah.’” (al-Bukhaari, 216; Muslim, 292). 3 – It is also narrated in al-Saheehayn from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the falsest of speech. Do not eavesdrop; do not spy on one another; do not envy one another; do not forsake one another; do not hate one another. Be, O slaves of Allaah, brothers.” Al-Bukhaari, 5144; Muslim, 2563. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Some of the scholars said that tahassus [‘eavesdropping’] means listening to other people’s conversations, and tajassus [‘spying’] means seeking out their faults. Or it was suggested that tajassus means looking for secrets. The word is mostly used in the sense of evil. The jaasoos (spy) is the one who seeks out secrets for evil purposes and the naamoos is the one who seeks out secrets for good purposes. And it was said that tajassus means looking for information for someone else, and tahassus means looking for information for oneself. This was the view of Tha’lab. And it was said that they mean one and the same, which is seeking out information about people’s circumstances.” 4 – al-Bukhaari (7042) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever speaks of a dream that he did not actually see will be ordered [on the Day of Judgement] to tie two grains of barley together, and he will never be able to do so. Whoever listens in on other people’s conversations when they do not like that will have molten lead poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever makes an image will be punished and will be ordered to breath life into it, and he will not be able to do so.” 5 – Ahmad (19277) and Abu Dawood (4880) narrated that Abu Barzah al-Aslami said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘O you who have spoken the words of faith but faith has not truly entered your hearts! Do not backbite about the Muslims, and do not seek out their faults. For whoever seeks out their faults, Allaah will seek out his faults, and if Allaah seeks out a person’s faults He will expose him even in his own house.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 4083. We do not think that a believer would read these great ahaadeeth and then volunteer to spy on his fellow-Muslims, or seek out their faults, or spread nameemah among them. We think that you are one of those who will benefit from this and pay attention, in sha Allaah. Hence we say that you must refuse to do this task, no matter what encouragement or threats you may receive, whilst also advising your colleagues to stop gossiping about their boss and telling them off for doing so. You should also advise your boss to stop spying on his employees and not be suspicious about them, because that will corrupt them and make them lose trust, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you seek out people’s faults you will corrupt them or almost corrupt them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4888; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 4088. We will conclude with a few points about the attitude of the Muslim towards nameemah or malicious gossip when it is passed on to him. Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said in his book al-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir: “The person who hears some malicious gossip, such as being told ‘So and so said this about you’ or ‘he did this to you,’ must do six things: 1 – He should not believe it, because the one who spreads nameemah is a faasiq (evildoer) according to scholarly consensus, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done” [al-Hujuraat 49:6] 2 – He should tell him not to repeat this evil action, which is evil in both religious and worldly terms. 3 – He should hate him for the sake of Allaah if he shows no sign of repenting. 4 – He should not think badly of the one of whom it was said, because he does not know whether that person really said it or did it. 5 – What he has been told should not make him spy on others or look for their faults for the purpose of verifying what was said, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not…” [al-Hujuraat 49:12] 6 – He should not approve for himself that which he has told the other person not to do, so he should not pass on the malicious gossip and say, ‘So and so told me this,’ otherwise he will also be gossiping and backbiting, and he will be doing that which he told someone else not to do. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to someone who passed on some malicious gossip to him: “If you wish, we can look into the matter. If you are lying, you will be one of the people mentioned in the verse ‘If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news’ [al-Hujuraat 49:6 – interpretation of the meaning]; and if you are telling the truth, you will be one of the people mentioned in the verse, ‘A slanderer, going about with calumnies’ [al-Qalam 68:11 – interpretation of the meaning]. Or if you wish, we will forgive you.” He said, “Forgive me, O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, I will never do it again.” The caliph Sulaymaan ibn ‘Abd al-Malik rebuked someone who had spread nameemah about him, in the presence of al-Zuhri. The man denied that and Sulaymaan said to him, “The one who told me about it is one who does not tell lies.” Al-Zuhri said: “The one who spreads nameemah (malicious gossip) cannot be truthful.” Sulaymaan said, “You are right,” and he let the man go in peace. Al-Hasan said: “The one who tells malicious gossip to you will tell malicious gossip about you. This indicates that the person who spreads malicious gossip should be hated and not believed or trusted. How can he not be hated when he persists in lying, backbiting, slandering, betraying, deceiving, envying, spreading mischief among the people and cheating? He is one of those who try to sever the ties which Allaah has commanded must be upheld and who spread mischief on earth. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress men and rebel in the earth without justification; for such there will be a painful torment’ [al-Shoora 42:42] - and the one who spreads malicious gossip is one of them.” And Allaah knows best."
381,How to Pray When Travelling,Question I am going abroad for one month. Let me know the easiest way of doing the prayers during this period.,"Praise be to Allah.When to shorten prayer while traveling If you have resolved to stay in the place to which you are travelling for more than four days, then you come under the same ruling as a resident from the moment you arrive there, so you have to do what the residents do, i.e., offer the prayers in full, and it is not permissible for you to shorten them . You may shorten the prayers during the journey , but when you reach the place you should offer the prayers in full, because you come under the same ruling as a resident. It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (8/99): “The kind of travel for which the concession of travel is prescribed is that which is regarded as travel according to custom, and the distance is approximately eighty kilometers. Whoever travels this distance or more may avail himself of the concessions for travellers, such as wiping over his socks for three days and two nights, joining and shortening prayers, and not fasting during Ramadan. If this traveller intends to stay in a place for more than four days, then he should not avail himself of the concessions for travellers. If he intends to stay there for four days or less, then he may avail himself of the concessions for travellers. If a traveller stays in a place but does not know when he will finish his business and cannot state a certain length of time for his stay, then he may avail himself of the concessions for travelling even if he stays for a long time. It makes no difference whether he travels by land or by sea.” Can you join prayers while travelling? With regard to joining prayers , it is permissible for a traveller to join Zhuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha, at the time of the earlier or later prayer, depending on what is easiest for him. But it is better for him not to do that unless it is difficult for him to offer every prayer on time. Based on that, you can join two prayers together during the journey, but when you reach the place where you intend to stay for a month, then you should offer every prayer on time. You should remember that prayer in congregation is obligatory for travellers as well as others. So try to pray in congregation in the mosque . And Allah knows best."
382,Ruling on working as a doctor in a hotel where the guests are foreigners who dress indecently,"Question I am a doctor. I have been offered a job in a clinic inside a hotel; this clinic is connected to the hospital and the salary is paid by the hospital, not the hotel. In this clinic, I will be responsible for dealing with emergency cases and first aid procedures for the guests and workers in the hotel. I will also be responsible for medical leave and bills for treatment for the hotel workers. The hotel will provide me with complete room and board, a room in the hotel, and food and drink at any time. The vast majority of the hotel guests are foreigners and non-Muslims; they wear clothing that shows most of their bodies. The hotel also serves alcohol, and parties are held there. What is the ruling on working in this place, noting that I will not be sitting in the place where alcohol is served, and I will not be attending those parties? I hope that you can cite the shar‘i evidence for this ruling.","Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that it is permissible to work as a doctor treating those who are staying in the hotel and others, so long as the doctor adheres to Islamic guidelines, which include not examining women except in cases of necessity, when there is no female doctor, and that it is limited to looking only at the site of the problem, and not touching any part of the woman’s body except with a barrier. But there are two factors in this work that are subject to reservations: The first: These foreigners are usually improperly dressed, so the one who treats them is exposing himself to grave fitnah (temptation) that may have a negative impact on his spiritual wellbeing and it is most likely that he will not be able to avoid seeing what is haraam and so on. It is well-known that preserving one’s religious commitment takes precedence over earning money, and there is nothing good in deeds that lead to the fire. The second: Being in places where there are many evils, such as free mixing, music, parties and alcohol, is a grave calamity and great test. Even if we assume that he will avoid the parties and places where alcohol is served, and he will avoid falling into anything haraam, seeing the people who do those things and mixing with them will have a negative impact on him. Therefore our advice to you is to flee for the sake of your religion, and look for work in a place that will be safer for your religious commitment. And Allah knows best."
383,He swallowed blood whilst he was praying,"Question I used the siwaak before Zuhr prayer, and in the middle of the prayer I felt a small amount of blood coming out. I tried not to swallow any of it but I could not help it. After the prayer I spat out some of the saliva that was in my mouth and found out that it was in fact blood. What is the ruling and do I have to make up this day?.","Praise be to Allah.You should not have swallowed this blood; you should have taken out a tissue whilst praying and spat the blood into it. Because you swallowed it without meaning to, your fast is still valid, but if you swallowed it deliberately then you have to make up this day. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If blood flows in his mouth or he burps up something (reflux) from the stomach, and he swallows it, then he has broken his fast even if it was a small amount, because the basic principle is that anything that goes from the mouth to the stomach breaks the fast. The basic principle is that the fast is broken by everything that reaches the stomach from the mouth, with exception of saliva because it is not possible to avoid it. But this principle applies to everything else. Al-Mughni, 4/356 And Allaah knows best."
384,Women’s voices in the field of animation,"Question I work in the field of graphic design, animation and advertising for children and adults alike; this is the field of three-dimensional design. In this field movement of the lips is done by hand of some characters by using a computer program, then after that human voices, male or female, are added to the movement of the lips according to the character. And sometimes there are women's voices with a little softness or laughter for example, as well as the ordinary tone of the voice. My question is: is this work not allowed on the basis that the woman's voice is ‘awrah and that all work should be free of women's voices in which there may be laughter or soft speech, no matter what the reason for this work is, even if there is some benefit to the viewer in it and even if it is for children, but may also be watched by adults?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The scholars differed with regard to the ruling on photographic images. Some of the scholars are of the view that it is haraam, and they quoted as evidence the general meaning of the hadeeths which forbid making images and forbid imitating the creation of Allah. Other scholars are of the view that photographic images are permissible and that they are not imitating the creation of Allah; rather it is capturing an image of a visible object, just as this image may be reflected in the mirror and so on. Those who allowed photographic images stipulated as a condition of it being permissible that the maker of the image should not change the features of the image from their original shape in any way; rather the image should be left as it is. See the answer to question number 82366. With regard to animated drawings, we have previously stated that some of the scholars allow them and that they are not haraam images, especially those that are produced for children, because it is narrated that there is a concession allowing children to play with dolls and the like. See the answer to question number 71170. Secondly: The scholars differed with regard to the ruling on a woman's image: is it ‘awrah or not? The more correct view concerning this matter is that a woman's voice is not ‘awrah in and of itself; rather a woman should keep her voice away from non-mahram men, and men should not be allowed to hear it, if the voice is used in such a way as to cause fitnah and pleasure, and if the voice is produced in a natural way or if it is in the context of chitchat, joking, laughing and the like, which may cause fitnah. It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah: With regard to the woman's voice, if the listener finds pleasure in it or fears that he may be tempted, it is haraam for him to listen to it, otherwise it is not haraam. There are reports about the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) talking to women and listening to their voices; these reports are to be understood as referring to cases in which there was no fear of fitnah. A woman should not make her voice soft and alluring, because this is the cause of temptation and because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire” [al-Ahzaab 33:32]. End quote. Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah, 4/90 See also the answer to question number 26304 and 1121. Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: If a woman speaks to the owner of the shop according to necessity and in a manner in which there is no fitnah, there is nothing wrong with that. Women used to speak to men about ordinary needs and matters in which there is no fitnah and within the bounds of necessity. But if it is accompanied by laughter or chitchat or an alluring tone, then this is haraam and is not permissible. Allah says to the wives of His Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and may Allah be pleased with them): “then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner” [al-Ahzaab 33:32]. Honourable speech is that which people recognise and is limited to what is necessary; anything more than that, if it involves laughing or speaking in an alluring tone and so on, or if she uncovers her face in front of him, or uncovers her arms or hands, all of that is haraam and is an evil deed and a means that may lead to temptation and falling into immoral actions. End quote. Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan Based on that, it is not permissible to produce a voice in which there is an alluring tone, softness of speech, laughter and the like, because that may lead to temptation and corruption. The prohibition is more emphatic if it is the voice of a known woman and those who hear it can work out whose voice it is, or if the image is of a specific woman. In that case the temptation may be stronger and it opens the door to temptation and infatuation with this woman, as well as the deceit involved in by adding a voice to an image which it does not belong. It is possible to achieve the hoped-for benefits, in sha Allah, without falling into any of these haraam actions. And Allah knows best."
385,Ruling on discount cards,"Question Some companies and hospitals issue discount cards. This is a card which is given to whoever wants one in return for a sum of money paid annually, and the carrier of the card can get some discounts or free examinations during the year. If after one year he has not used the card, he does not have the right to ask for the money that he paid to be returned.","Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on issuing these cards and dealing in them. He replied: This is not permissible, because it involves ambiguity, gambling and a great deal of risk, so we should avoid it. And Allaah is the source of strength,"
386,Voluntarily giving more than a saa’ for zakaat al-fitr,"Question Is it permissible to give more than a saa’ for zakaat al-fitr, and let the extra amount be sadaqah (charity)?.","Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is nothing wrong with that; the saa’ will be the obligatory zakaat al-fitr and anything more than that will be voluntary, and the giver will be rewarded for it. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who owed zakaat al-fitr and knew that it was a saa’, but he gave more than that, and said that it was naafil. Is that makrooh? He replied: Yes, it is permissible and is not makrooh according to most scholars, such as al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and others. It was only narrated from Maalik that it is makrooh. As for giving less than what is required, that is not permissible, according to scholarly consensus. End quote. Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Taymiyah (25/70)."
387,Physical action is an essential part of faith without which faith is not sound,"Question Some people think that physical righteous deeds are a prerequisite for the perfection of faith, but not one of the essential elements thereof, or in other words, they are not essential for the validity of faith. There has been a great deal of disagreement among people concerning this matter, so we hope that you can explain how valid this argument is, may Allah reward you. Please explain how important physical righteous deeds are to faith.","Praise be to Allah.What is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, and the righteous early generations are agreed upon this, is that faith consists of both words and deeds, and may increase and decrease; there is no faith unless it is accompanied by actions, just as there is no faith unless it is accompanied by words. So faith is not valid unless both are present together. This is an issue that is known to Ahl as-Sunnah. As for the view that action is something required for the perfection of faith, this is the view of the Ash‘aris and others like them; it is well-known that the view of the Ash‘aris with regard to faith (eemaan) is one of the ideas of the Murji’ah. Ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The consensus of the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een, and those who came after them, and our contemporaries, is that faith consists of words, deeds and intentions, and none of the three is valid except with the others. End quote from Sharh Usool I‘tiqaad Ahl as-Sunnah by al-Laalkaa’i (5/956); Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa (7/209). Al-Aajurri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You should understand – may Allah have mercy on us and you – that the view of the Muslim scholars is that faith is obligatory for all people, and it consists of belief in the heart, affirmation on the tongue, and physical actions (righteous deeds). Moreover, you should understand that having knowledge and belief in the heart is not sufficient unless it is accompanied by verbal affirmation of faith, and knowledge in the heart and verbal affirmation are not valid unless they are accompanied by physical action (righteous deeds). Once a person combines these three characteristics, then he is a believer. This is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, and the views of the Muslim scholars.""(Ash-Sharee‘ah 2/116). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Based on this issue, we may conclude two things, the first of which has to do with visible disbelief and the second has to do with hidden disbelief. As for the second (the issue of hidden disbelief), that is based on the view that faith consists of both words and deeds, as stated above. It is not possible for a man who believes firmly and strongly in his heart that Allah has enjoined upon him prayer, zakaah, fasting and Hajj, to live all his life without prostrating once to Allah, or fasting Ramadan, or giving zakaah for the sake of Allah, or going on pilgrimage to His House. That is not possible, and this cannot happen unless the person harbours hypocrisy and heresy in his heart. It does not happen when there is sound faith.""(Majmoo‘ al-Fatawa 7/616). Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no difference of opinion among the ummah that Tawheed must exist in the heart, which is knowledge; and on the tongue, which is words (verbal affirmation); and in one’s actions, which is acting in accordance with the commands and prohibitions. If a person does not fulfil one of these three, then he is not a Muslim. If he affirms Tawheed but does not act in accordance with it, then he is a stubborn disbeliever, like Pharaoh and Iblees. If he acts outwardly in accordance with Tawheed, but does not believe in it in his heart, then he is a pure hypocrite, worse than a disbeliever. And Allah knows best.""(Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah fi’l-Ajwibah an-Najdiyyah 2/124). He also said: You should understand – may Allah have mercy on you – that the validity of religious commitment depends on what is in the heart of belief, love and hate, and it depends on a person uttering (the word of Islam, the Shahaadah) and refraining from uttering words of disbelief, and it depends on physical deeds, by putting the pillars of Islam into action, and refraining from deeds that render one a disbeliever. If one of these three is missing, then the person becomes a disbeliever and an apostate.""(Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah 10/87). The scholars of Ahl as-Sunnah discussed this issue at length, including the fatwas issued by the Standing Committee that warn against some books which reiterate the view that physical actions (righteous deeds) are a precondition for the perfection of faith (and not an essential part thereof). The Committee has stated that that is the view of the Murji’ah. See: Fatawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (2/127-139, vol. 3). According to Ahl as-Sunnah, physical action is an essential part of faith, without which faith is not valid, and a lack of physical action is indicative of a lack of faith in the heart, because they are strongly interconnected. Whoever thinks that there could be strong and sound faith without that leading to physical action (righteous deeds), even though he knows about his religious duties and is able to do them, is thinking that something impossible is possible, and is denying the connection between physical action and what is in the heart, and is following the blameworthy view of the Murji’ah. And Allah knows best."
388,Is Horse Meat Halal?,Question What is the ruling on eating horse meat?,"Praise be to Allah.Views allowing eating horse meat The majority of scholars are of the view that it is permissible to eat horses, because of the sound ahadith that have been narrated concerning that. Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: On the day of Khaybar, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade eating the flesh of domestic donkeys, but he granted a concession with regard to horses. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3982; Muslim, 1941) Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we slaughtered a horse and ate it. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5191; Muslim, 1942) Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We traveled with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and we used to eat the flesh of horses and drink their milk. (Narrated by al-Daraqutni and al-Bayhaqi. Al-Nawawi said: with a sahih isnad.) Views disallowing horse meat Other scholars – including Abu Hanifah and his two companions – are of the view that it is makruh to eat horse meat. They quoted a Quranic verse and a hadith as evidence for that. The verse is as follows (interpretation of the meaning): “And (He has created) horses, mules and donkeys, for you to ride and as an adornment.” [al-Nahl 16:8] They said: He did not mention eating them, but He mentioned eating an'am animals (camels, cattle etc) in a previous verse (verse 5). The scholars responded to that by noting that mention of riding and adornment does not mean that their benefits are limited to that, rather these two are singled out for mention because they are the uses to which horses are put in the majority of cases. This is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-maitah (the dead animals — cattle — beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine” [al-Maidah 5:3]. Here flesh is mentioned because that is what is usually eaten in most cases. The Muslims are unanimously agreed that the fat, blood and all other parts of the pig are also forbidden, and they said: hence Allah does not mention carrying load on horses, although He says with regard to an'am animals (camels etc), “And they carry your loads” [al-Nahl 16:7]. This does not imply that it is haram to carry loads on horses.” (Al-Majmu’) The hadith that they quote is that which was narrated from Khalid ibn al-Walid, that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the flesh of horses, mules and donkeys, and every wild animal that has fangs.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasai and Ibn Majah.) This hadith is da’if (weak), and was classed as such by al-Albani in Da’if Abi Dawud. Al-Hafiz Musa ibn Harun said: “This is a weak hadith. Al-Bukhari said: This hadith is subject to further investigation.” Al-Bayhaqi said: “This is a mudtarab (faulty) isnad, and in addition to that it contradicts the ahadith of trustworthy narrators, which say that the meat of horses is permitted. Al-Khattabi said: There is something wrong with its isnad. Abu Dawud said: This hadith is mansukh (abrogated). Al-Nasai said: The hadith which says that it is permissible is more sound. It is more likely, if this is sahih, that it has been abrogated, because of what it says in the sahih hadith, “Permission was given to eat the flesh of horses,” indicates that.” (Al-Majmu’, 9/7-5) For more about halal and non-halal meat, please see these answers: 1919 , 169813 , 10498 and 22866 . And Allah knows best."
389,Ruling on Muslim women working as nurses and doctors,"Question My wife is studing to become a nurse at a University, is it lawful to: -examine patients(male or female) and give them baths which are apart of the class projects. -examine men as a nurse in non-emergency situations at a non-muslim hospital. -work at a home for the mentally ill where the co-workers are male and the patients are also.","Praise be to Allah.If a woman finds that she has to work because of necessity, she is permitted to work outside the home, as is indicated by the fact that the two daughters of Shu’ayb used to water the sheep, and the story of Asma’ bint Abi Bakr working outside the home. If a woman is widowed with children, and has no breadwinner and is receiving no money from the Bayt al-Maal (treasury), it is permissible for her to earn a living. Although we say that a woman is permitted to work outside the home when it is necessary, she should nevertheless do only the work she needs to do in order to meet her needs. If a woman has professional skills which not every woman possesses, and which are needed by other woman and society as a whole, then it is permissible for her to practice her profession outside the home, so long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah and has the permission of her legal (shar’i) guardian. The evidence that it is permissible for the woman to work outside the home in a field where there is a need for her work, as long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah, is to be seen in the fact that at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), midwives used to attend women in labour, and skilled women used to practice circumcision, and he did not condemn them for doing so. It is also known that Rufaydah al-Ansaariyyah used to treat the wounded in her tent, which had been set up in the mosque for that purpose. She was very skilled in treating the sick, and her work was done with the knowledge and express permission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Sa’d ibn Mu’aadh was transferred to her tent for treatment. This indicates that it is permissible for a woman to practice her profession outside the home, and by analogy we may deduce that it is permissible for a female doctor to open a clinic outside her home for the treatment of women and children. By doing this, she is fulfilling the duty of fard kifaayah (a duty falling on the entire community – if some people fulfil it, responsibility is lifted from the rest, otherwise all will be held accountable. Translator). Such clinics make it easy for sick women to come to a female doctor, hence they no longer have to uncover their ‘awrah before a male doctor when they need treatment. But this permission is given on the condition that this work does not affect her duties towards her own home, husband and children, and that she has her husband’s permission, because these duties are her individual duties (fard ‘ayn), which take precedence over her responsibilities towards the community (fard kifaayah). When there is any conflict, her individual duties must come first. (Al-Mufassal by ‘Abd al-Kareem, 4/272). Another hadeeth which describes Muslim women at the beginning of Islam practising a profession was narrated by Hafsah, concerning a woman who used to treat the wounded. Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, reported in his Saheeh that Hafsah said: “A woman came and stayed at the fort of Bani Khalaf, and told us about her sister. Her sister’s husband used to go out on military campaigns with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He had been on twelve campaigns, and she (his wife) had accompanied him on six. She said, ‘We used to treat the wounded and take care of the sick…’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 313). But a woman’s work as a nurse or doctor is regulated by the rules indicated in other Islamic texts. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, commenting on the above hadeeth, mentioned some of these conditions: “What we learn from this hadeeth is that a woman is allowed to offer medical treatment to a non-mahram man (one to whom she is not related), so long as this takes the form of bringing medicine to him, for example, or other forms of indirect treatment (i.e. with no touching or direct contact involved) – except in cases where it is necessary and there is no fear of temptation (such as in an emergency situation or in the event of a disaster).” If a woman works in complete hijaab, without touching a male patient, or being alone with him in any way, and as long as there is no fear that she may be the cause of temptation or be tempted herself, and she is not neglecting a more essential duty such as taking care of her husband or children, and she has the permission of her guardian, then it is permissible for her to work. In principle, men should be treated by male doctors and nurses, and women by female doctors and nurses. There should be no mixing of the sexes in medical treatment, except when it is necessary and as long as there is no fear of temptation. And Allah knows best."
390,She accepted him as a husband after praying istikhaarah but he divorced her,"Question A while ago a man proposed to me and I accepted him after my mother and I prayed istikharah more than once. We had our contract done, but six months later he divorced me for unknown reasons from his side. I mean unconvincing reasons like: he has cold feelings towards me after he was badly in love with me. This made me depressed and made me hate all men who do not care but about themselves. I do really hate men and I do not want to be engaged again. Because the first time everything was just fine, I mean “traditional marriage” and I prayed istikharah before I accepted this marriage. Note: this man works in a bank, is it possible that Allah is punishing me because I accepted to marry one works in a bank? Despite praying istikharah more than once.","Praise be to Allah. We understand your feelings about this matter, which has caused you hardship and pain, but it may be that it is very good for you, and you will come to understand that later on, in sha Allaah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim (2999). The believing woman accepts the decree of Allaah and knows that Allaah is more merciful towards her than she is herself, and that calamities increase the believer in reward and status, if he is patient and seeks reward. Secondly: If the young man who proposed to you was working in a riba-based bank, then praise Allaah for having diverted him from you, and that you did not become his wife, eating from his haraam wealth. This is the result of istikhaarah, praise be to Allaah, because the result of istikhaarah may not be immediately apparent, and both parties may go ahead, then Allaah diverts one or both of them from completing the matter. You may be completely certain that Allaah has chosen the better of the two for you, and that what happened of making the marriage contract then divorce, is a test from Allaah, and it is good and beneficial, even though it may cause you some sorrow and pain. Undoubtedly you made a mistake when you accepted this young man, as the first thing you should look for is religious commitment and good character. The one who works with riba, either recording it or witnessing it or anything else, is lacking in good character and is exposing himself to the curse and being banished from the mercy of Allaah, so how could a believing woman accept him as a husband and father of her children? Praise Allaah and give thanks to Him for this blessing, and learn a lesson from this experience, for if a person is saved one time, he may not be saved again. It is very strange for a person whom Allaah diverts away from evil as a sign of mercy and kindness, to still be upset about his loss. Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: A person may think of some trade or position of leadership until it is made available to him, then Allaah looks at him and says to the angels: Divert it away from him, for if it is made easy for him he will enter Hell. So Allaah diverts it away from him, but he keeps saying, So and so beat me to it, So and so humiliated me, when it is nothing more than a bounty from Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.” Thirdly: With regard to the frustration that has befallen you and your determination not to go through this again, it is better for you not to have this attitude. If a person fails once it does not mean that he will fail every time, rather you can learn from what has happened so that it will motivate you to make a good choice next time, on the basis of religious commitment and good character. We ask Allaah to increase you in faith and piety, and to bless you with a righteous husband and righteous offspring. And Allaah knows best."
391,Should he tell on an employee who goes to permissive websites?,"Question I am the manager of Internet in a government department. A few days ago, I became suspicious about the way one of the employees is using the Internet, so I installed a spy program and after a few days I found out that this man goes to permissive websites -- Allaah forbid -- and up until now no one except me knows about what this employee is doing. I am very confused as to how I should deal with him, knowing that if the boss found out, he would dismiss him immediately. Should I speak to this person privately and advise him? Or should I tell the boss above me about him, and let whatever will happen happen? Or should I prevent him from using the Internet, and in this case what excuse should I give for preventing him?.","Praise be to Allah. If it is proven that this employee is going to permissive websites, then you must advise him and warn him, call him (to proper Islamic behaviour) and guide him, and remind him of the negative consequences and sins that result from going to these websites. If he responds, then praise be to Allaah, but if he persists in that, then there is nothing wrong with telling the director of the centre, so that he can take suitable measures concerning him. The scholars permitted mentioning a man’s faults and bad deeds for the sake of seeking help to change evil, if it is not possible to change it otherwise. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim: But it is permissible to speak of a person in his absence for a legitimate shar’i purpose, such as seeking help to change evil and bring a sinner back to the right path. So he may say to the one whom he hopes is able to help: So and so is doing such and such, so deter him from that, and so on … end quote. But that should only come after advising him and exhorting him in private. May Allaah help us and you to obey Him and seek His pleasure. And Allaah knows best."
392,Gifts to current account holder in the bank,Question I have a current account in a bank. Sometimes the bank sends me gifts such as perfumes and incense. The bank does this with the clients who have much money in it. What is the ruling on such gifts?.,"Praise be to Allah.A current account in the bank is a loan, and the scholars are unanimously agreed that every loan that brings a benefit is riba. It is proven that some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) said that a gift given by the borrower to the lender is riba. Al-Bukhaari (3814) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: If a man owes you something and he gives you a measure of wheat or a measure of barley or a measure of fodder, do not take it, for it is riba. So this gift that the bank gives to the customer for holding a current account is riba. Shaykh Dr. Muhammad ibn Sa’ood al-‘Usaymi was asked about the ruling on such gifts. He said: If it is given because of having a current account then it is undoubtedly riba, because a current account is a loan, and it is not permissible for the account holder to benefit from it. But if it is an investment account there is nothing wrong with it. End quote."
393,Wiping the ears in wudoo’,Question There was a dispute about wiping the ears in wudoo. Some people say that there is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wiped his ears when performing wudoo.,"Praise be to Allah.There is proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wiped his head and ears when performing wudoo. Ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wiped his head and his ears, inside and out. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who classed it as saheeh). Al-Nisaa'i reports that he wiped his head and his ears, wiping the inside of them with his index-finger and the outside of them with his thumb. (Classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah). Abu Dawood and al-Tahhaawi report from Miqdaad ibn Madi Karb that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he performed wudoo, wiped his head and his ears, inside and out, inserting his finger into the ear canal. (Reported by Abu Dawood; al-Haafiz ibn Hijr said: Its isnaad is hasan.) There is no dispute that one should wipe the ears during wudoo; the dispute is as to whether they are considered to be part of the head or not, and whether it is sunnah or waajib (obligatory) to wipe them."
394,Can You Wear Shoes During Tawaf?,"Question I made hajj this year, and I made tawaf al-ifadah near the Ka’bah with my shoes on, and I also made sa`i with my shoes on. Is this permissible? If not, then do I have to repeat my tawaf and sa`i. (my shoes were very clean.)","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to do tawaf wearing shoes if they are clean. The Sunnah is to pray wearing shoes sometimes. If prayer wearing shoes is valid, then it is even more likely that doing tawaf and sa`i in shoes is also valid. It is better not to do tawaf wearing shoes, so that people who are careless and who do not take care to avoid impurities will not follow your example, which would lead to the mosque being contaminated and made dirty. The pilgrim may need to do tawaf and sa`i wearing shoes because of injuries to his feet and so on. So there is nothing wrong with him doing tawaf in his shoes , after making sure that they are clean. The Prophet (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you comes to the mosque, if he sees some dirt on his shoes, let him wipe them and pray in them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (555) and classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him.) And Allah knows best."
395,What is meant by the phrase “All rights reserved”?,"Question What is meant by the phrase “All rights reserved” – which is found on your website, for example? Does it mean that it is not permissible for me to benefit from the website or book on which this phrase is written, or to copy anything from it?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The custom is for authors of intellectual property, inventions, writings, programs and apps to write the phrase “All rights reserved” in the introduction to or at the beginning of their works. What this phrase means is that all intellectual property rights and patents that have to do with this work are protected and preserved for the party that is in charge of this work. The rights that have to do with that are of two types: (i) Moral and literary rights what this means is: the right to have this item, written work or program attributed to its author; the right to give consent to publication thereof; the right to define the way in which it is to be published; the right to alter it and withdraw it from circulation when necessary, and so on. (ii) Material rights these materials, products and inventions have financial value, and the author has the right to give them to people for free or in return for financial gain. All returns and financial privileges connected to these works are regarded as being the author’s rights. According to a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council: Trade names, business names, trademarks, written works, inventions and patents are all rights that belong to their owners or authors. According to modern customs and usage they have acquired considerable monetary value. These rights are respected in sharee‘ah and it is not permissible to transgress against them. Secondly: The fact that rights are reserved for the authors does not mean that it is not allowed to quote from the works and make use of and benefit from what they contain of knowledge and goodness. Therefore there is nothing wrong with a person quoting or making use of these works, on condition that he attributes the quotation to the source. Jamal ad-Deen al-Qaasimi said: One of the important matters to note when writing books is the importance of attributing ideas, analyses and conclusions to the authors, so as to avoid attributing to yourself anything that is not yours, and so as to avoid being like the one who wears two garments of falsehood (by pretending to have been given something that he was not given – as mentioned in the hadith narrated by Muslim). End quote from Qawaa‘id at-Tahdeeth (p. 40) Part of intellectual honesty is attributing words and ideas to their authors, and not benefitting and learning from others then attributing what one has learnt to oneself, for that is a type of theft and a kind of deceit and forgery. End quote from ar-Rasool wa’l-‘Ilm (p. 63) However the author of this work does not have the right to prevent people from benefitting from it and quoting from it. If he says something to that effect, his words are to be ignored. See also the answer to question no. 218902 . Thirdly: The protection of authors’ rights does not mean that it is not allowed to make copies of this work or download it – in any format – if the aim of doing so is personal use. But if that is done for the purpose of making money and trading in these works, by publishing and distributing them, then this is a prohibited action, because it is a transgression against the material rights of the author of the work. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: Is it permissible for us to make copies of tapes on which it is written “All rights reserved”? Is the ruling different if the copies are made for free distribution, i.e., for da‘wah and not for trade? He replied: What appears to me to be the case is that if they are copied for personal use, there is nothing wrong with that. But if it is for trade, such as if a recording studio makes copies of these tapes, then that is not permissible, because it is a transgression against the brother’s rights. If it is a student who wants to make a copy from another student, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote from at-Ta‘leeq ‘ala al-Kaafi by Ibn Qudaamah (3/373) He was also asked: what is the ruling on making copies of tapes that are copyrighted? He said: What I think is that if a person makes a copy for himself only, and not for trade, there is nothing wrong with it, because this does not harm anyone. As for the one who copies it for the purpose of trade and distribution, this is a transgression, and is like a Muslim underselling his brother, and for a Muslim to undersell his brother is haraam. End quote from Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftooh (164/17). We have previously quoted a fatwa of Shaykh Sa‘d al-Humayyid in question no. 21927, in which he said that making copies of a book or disc for the purpose of trading in it and harming the original producer is not permissible. But if a person makes a single copy for himself, then we hope that there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better not to do that. End quote. Conclusion: The phrase “All rights reserved” does not prevent personal use, or quoting or benefitting from a work. Rather what is disallowed and prohibited is claiming the efforts and work of someone else and attributing it to oneself, or copying it with the aim of making a profit from it and trading in it without the permission of the rightful owner. For more information, please see: 38847 and 131437 And Allah knows best."
396,When should the takbeer for Eid al-Fitr begin?,Question When should the takbeer for Eid al-Fitr begin and when does it end?.,"Praise be to Allah.At the end of Ramadan Allah has prescribed that His slaves should recite takbeer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him” [al-Baqarah 2:185] “that you must magnify Allah” means venerating Him in your hearts and on your lips, by pronouncing the takbeer. So you should say: Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god except Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allah). Or you can say Allahu akbar three times, so you say: Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god except Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great , Allah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allah). Both are permissible. This takbeer is Sunnah according to the majority of scholars. It is Sunnah for both men and woman, in the mosque, in the home and in the marketplace. Men should say it out loud, and women should say it quietly, because women are commanded to lower their voices. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you notice something during the prayer, men should say ‘Subhan-Allah!’ and women should clap.” So women should say the takbeer quietly and men should say it out loud. The time for this takbeer begins when the sun sets on the night of Eid (i.e., the night before) if it is known that the new month has begun when the sun sets, such as when the people have completed thirty days of Ramadaan, or when it is proven that the new moon of Shawwal has been sighted. And it ends when the prayer begins, i.e., when they start the Eid prayer then the time for the takbeer ends. Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 16/269-272. Al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm: Allah says concerning the month of Ramadaan (interpretation of the meaning): “(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you” [al-Baqarah 2:185] I heard from some scholars whom I trust and who are knowledgeable about the Qur’aan: “(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you” it is completed when the sun sets on the last day of the month of Ramadan. Then al-Shaafa’i said: When they see the new moon of Shawwal, I like all the people to recite takbeer together and individually in the mosques, the marketplaces, the streets, the houses, travellers and non-travellers in all situations, no matter where they are. They should pronounce the takbeer openly and continue to recite it until they come to the prayer-place the next morning, and after that until the imam comes out to lead the prayer, then they should stop reciting the takbeer. Then he narrated from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, Abu Salamah and Abu Bakr ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, that they used to recite takbeer on the night before Eid al-Fitr in the mosque, reciting the takbeer out loud. It was narrated from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr and Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan that they used to recite the takbeer out loud when they came to the prayer-pace in the morning, and that Naafi’ ibn Jubayr used to recite the takbeer out loud when he came to the prayer-place in the morning of the day of Eid. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that he used to come to the prayer-place on the morning of the day of Eid al-Fitr, when the sun had risen, and he would recite takbeer until he reached the prayer-place, then he would recite takbeer in the prayer-place until the imam sat down and stopped reciting takbeer."
397,Accepting a gift from a kaafir,"Question Is it permissible for a Muslim brother to accept a gift from his kaafir or mushrik brother, or not?.","Praise be to Allah.It s permissible for a Muslim to accept a gift from his brother even if he is a kaafir or a mushrik, because that will soften his heart and make him more open to being guided to Islam. And Allaah is the Source of strength."
398,Tricks that the Shaytan uses to misguide people,"Question What is the order of importance of acts of worship? I learned from an Islamic tape that the Shaytan has tricks, one of which is that he starts by trying to make the person a disbeliever; if he cannot do that, he tries to make him not pray; if he cannot do that, he tries to prevent him from doing acts of worship that earn greater reward, and so on, until he comes to the least that he can do, which is making the person overindulge in what is permissible; in other words, he makes him extravagant and wasteful I hope that you can explain the order of acts of worship in terms of importance, because I do not know which bring great reward and which bring greater reward.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is as if the questioner is referring to something that she heard from a da‘iyah, quoting something that Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in his valuable book Madarij as-Salikin. He (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned seven diversions through which the accursed Shaytan is keen to lead the son of Adam to doom, and he does not move on from the diversion that would lead to the worst outcome to the one that comes after it unless he has failed to achieve anything with the first one. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 1. The first diversion is that through which they Shaytan tries to lead him to disbelief in Allah, His religion, the meeting with Him, His perfect attributes and what His Messengers have told us about Him. If he achieves his goal through this diversion, then the fire of his enmity will cool down and he will feel relief. But if the individual overcomes this devilish attempt by virtue of his insight, which is based on guidance, and is saved from it, and the light of faith in his heart remains intact, then the Shaytan will move on to the second diversion. 2. The second diversion is the diversion of innovation (bid ‘ah), whether that involves belief that is contrary to that with which Allah sent His Messenger and sent down His Book; or through worshipping Allah in ways for which Allah has not granted permission, such as rituals and practices that have been introduced into the religion, none of which Allah will accept… If the individual overcomes this devilish attempt and is saved from this diversion by the light of the Sunnah, and he protected himself against it by truly following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and adhering to what was narrated from the best generations, namely the Sahabah and those who followed them in truth, it is very unlikely that the people of later generations will allow such a person to be safe from this type of diversion. If he escapes them, then the promoters of innovation will set up traps and cause him much trouble, and they will accuse him of being an innovator. 3. The third diversion is major sins. If the Shaytan has a chance, he will try to entice him and make major sins appear attractive to him, and make him delay repentance. … If the individual overcomes this devilish attempt by the protection of Allah, or through sincere repentance that will save him from it, then the Shaytan will resort to the fourth diversion. 4. The fourth diversion is minor sins. The Shaytan will encourage him to commit many of them, and will tell him: Do not worry about minor sins, so long as you avoid major sins; do you not know that minor sins may be forgiven if you avoid major sins and do some righteous deeds? And he will keep trying to persuade him that it is not a serious issue, so that he will persist in them, to the extent that the one who commits a major sin but is afraid, worried and filled with regret will be better off than him, because persisting in minor sin is worse than the major sin referred to above. There is no major sin if one repentants and seeks forgiveness, and there is no minor sin if one persists in it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of the sins that you regard as minor.” Then he gave a likeness of that, namely people who halted in the wilderness and needed to collect firewood, so one person brought a stick, and another brought a stick, until they had accumulated a large pile, then they lit a fire and cooked their bread. Similarly, the sins that people regard as minor accumulate whilst the individual thinks that they are nothing, until they lead to his doom. 5. The fifth diversion is permissible actions for which there is no blame on the one who does them, but the Shaytan will distract him with them, so that he does not do a great deal of acts of worship and will not strive to acquire provision for the hereafter. Then the Shaytan tries to make him give up doing some Sunnahs, then after he makes him give up some Sunnah acts of worship, he tries to make him give up obligatory acts of worship. The least harm he may be able to inflict on him is making him miss out on a great deal of good deeds and causing him to fail to attain high status. If the individual realised how much he was missing out on of good deeds, he would not have missed any of the acts of worship, but he is ignorant of the reward he could attain for every act of worship. If he is saved from this diversion by virtue of his perfect insight and the light of guidance, and his knowing the virtue of the acts of worship and the importance of doing a great deal of them, how short his life is, how important it is that he should strive in doing righteous deeds and how generous Allah is in giving reward, and he becomes very careful about how he spends his time, and he does not let any minute pass without earning reward for good deeds – in that case the enemy will seek to deploy the sixth diversion. 6. The sixth diversion is causing him to do righteous deeds and acts of worship that earn less reward than others, and prompting him to focus on that. So he makes appealing to him the virtue that he will gain from that, and brings to his mind the rewards that he will earn thereby, in order to distract him thereby from other acts of worship that are superior to them and would bring him greater reward. As the Shaytan failed to stop him attaining any reward at all, he tries to reduce the reward that he does earn, so that he will not attain perfection and high status. He does this by distracting him with acts of worship and righteous deeds that are inferior in terms of reward, to prevent him from doing those that will earn him greater reward, and with those that are less dear to Allah, to prevent him from doing those which are more dear to Him. But where are those who are able to overcome this diversion? They are few in this world, for the Shaytan manages to ensnare the majority with the first diversion. If someone is saved from this diversion, because he has learned about righteous deeds and their level of importance before Allah, and how they vary in virtue, and what the yearn of reward, and he has learned to distinguish between those of greatest importance and those of the least importance, between those which are superior and those which are inferior, between those which are foremost and those which are less than that, between those that are dominant and those that are subordinate, then he will be saved from this diversion. It is very important for the one who wants to be saved from this diversion to learn that among deeds there are those which are dominant and those which are subordinate, those which are foremost and those which are less than that, those which are at the pinnacle and those which are lower than that, as it is mentioned in the sahih hadith: “The best prayer for forgiveness (sayyid al-istighfar) that a person may say is: Allahumma anta rabbiy, la ilaha illa anta… (O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no god worthy of worship except You…).” According to another hadith: “Jihad is the pinnacle of the matter.” And in another report: “Good deeds boasted to one another,” and each deed mentioned its status and virtue, and charity had an advantage over all of them. No one can overcome this diversion except those who have deep insight and sincerity, and are people of knowledge who are helped to follow the path of truth. If they give due appreciation to various acts of worship and righteous deeds, each will be given his due. If he is saved from that, there remains one diversion through which his enemy will try to harm him, and it is unavoidable. If anyone were to be saved from it, it would be the messengers and prophets of Allah, the dearest of creation to Him. This diversion is the enemy’s motivating his troops to cause all manner of harm, physical and verbal, stemming from ill will, and is commensurate with the individual’s efforts to do good. The greater his striving, the greater the enemy’s efforts and the more people he will prompt to cause him harm, and he will rally his troops against him to cause him every possible harm. There is no way he can overcome this diversion, for the harder he strives and the greater his efforts to call people to Allah and urge them to uphold His commands, the harder his enemy will strive to tempt foolish people to cause him harm. When he is faced with this diversion, he should prepare for war and start fighting the enemy for the sake of Allah and with the help of Allah.""(Madarij as-Saalikin bayna Manazil Iyyaka na‘budu wa iyyaka nasta‘in 1/237). Secondly: Regarding the question about the order of acts of worship, and which is the best of them, this has been answered previously on this website, and we have explained that it varies from one person and situation to another. For information on that, please see question no. 21374 . However, one of the most beneficial things that will help a person in his religious affairs and keep him steadfast on the path of Islam, and will also be most effective in making him consistent in obeying Allah is constantly remembering his Lord in all his affairs, and constantly reciting dhikr in all situations. It was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Bisr (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: O Messenger of Allah, the teachings of Islam are becoming overwhelming for me. Tell me of something that I can adhere to. He said: “Keep your tongue moist with remembrance of Allah.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (3375); he said: It is a hasan gharib hadith. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani. And Allah knows best."
399,He is asking about a ruqyah so that he will be blessed with a child,Question One of my brother is married for last 5 years and till today they do not any children. The reason is best know by Allah the Almighty. The couple has done all medical checkups etc and the doctors confirmed that everything is OK with both of them and just wait for the right time which Allah has planned for you and you will a child. But now his parents are not having any patience and telling the couple to do the following act “they are saying that you should fast for twenty one days and recite one of the beautiful attributes of Allah i.e AL-MUSSAWRO (meaning of this name of Allah is Creator of the Face) for seven times blow it on the glass water and break your fast with this water Insallah Allah will give a child”. Now I wan to know is this practice is correct in the light of Quraan & Sunnah or not? If it is correct practice then provide some sort of proof in the light of Quarran & Sunnah,"Praise be to Allah. This kind of ruqyah that has been suggested to the husband and his parents is not something that has been prescribed in sharee’ah, because there is no proof of it in the Qur’aan or saheeh Sunnah as far as we know. Hence the couple should refrain from doing this and should turn to the kinds of ruqyah that are prescribed in sharee’ah and the du’aa’s that are proven in the Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah. With regard to calling upon Allaah by His names for healing from sickness, including infertility, this is permissible because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them” [al-A’raaf 7:180] And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that, as he recited ruqyah for some people by saying, “Adhhib al-ba’s Rabb an-naas, wa’shfi anta al-Shaafi, laa shifaa’a illa shifaa’uka shifaa’ laa yughaadir saqaman (Take away the pain, O Lord of mankind, and grant healing, for You are the Healer, and there is no healing but Your healing that leaves no trace of sickness).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5743; Muslim, 48, 47, 46. See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, no. 9120, in Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, issue no. 27, p. 64. But specifying a particular name of Allaah such as choosing the name al-Musawwir for praying for healing is something for which evidence is required. If there is no such evidence then using a particular name for du’aa’ is to be regarded as something that is not prescribed in sharee’ah. What is prescribed with regard to du’aa’ is for the person who is making du’aa’ to choose names of Allaah that befit his request, such as saying al-Ghaffaar (the Oft-Forgiving) when praying for forgiveness, and so on. It should be noted that the matter of having children or otherwise is something that is subject to the will and decree of Allaah. Allaah has told us about that in His Book, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): “To Allaah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills. 50. Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All‑Knower and is Able to do all things” [al-Shoora 42:49-50] This is something that is decreed by Allaah alone. The couple should turn to Allaah and ask Him for righteous offspring; they should turn to du’aa’ and dhikr. Concerning that Allaah says in His Book: “And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqoon (the pious)’” [al-Furqaan 25:74] If there is some sickness that has caused the problem, there is nothing wrong with treating it with permissible medicines, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Treat disease, for Allaah has not created any disease but He has also created a cure for it, except for one disease, namely old age.” Narrated by Abu Dawood from Usaamah ibn Shareek, no. 3855; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has not send down any disease but He has also sent down the cure.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 3482; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. No matter what the cause of this problem, the Muslim has to depend on Allaah, put his trust in Him and accept His will and decree with patience. He must have certain faith that there is reward and much good in that, by Allaah’s leave. He should think about the situation and lives of other people; some people are tested with bad offspring who cause them misery and hardship, and others have handicapped offspring and cannot bear that, and other such cases such as parents suffering from children’s disobedience, severing of family ties, and so on. Allaah never decrees for the believer anything but that which is good for him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that does not apply to anyone apart from the believer. If something good happens to him he is grateful, and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim, no. 2999."
400,Are there any guidelines or conditions with regard to using the black seed?,"Question Are there any guidelines on consumption of black seed? I have found some websites that stipulate some conditions; for example, they stipulate that one should consume seven seeds, mixed with honey, and that one must close the mouth when chewing them, and so on. I hope that you can explain this matter. I would also like to ask you to pray for healing for me, as I am suffering from a chronic illness and by Allah I wish for death at every moment.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Al-Bukhaari (5688) and Muslim (2215) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say concerning the black seed: “In it there is healing for every disease, except as-saam.” Ibn Shihaab said: As-saam is death. There are two scholarly views concerning the words “healing from every disease”. It was suggested that it is to be understood according to the general meaning, so it includes all diseases, or that it is general in wording but specific in meaning, so what is meant is some diseases. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was said that the words “every disease” refer to every disease that could be treated with it, because it is beneficial in the case of cold diseases; as for hot diseases, it is not. Al-Khattaabi said: The words “From every disease” are general terms but what is meant by them is something specific, because there is no medicine made from plants that could be used to treat all diseases; rather what is meant is that it is healing for every disease that is caused by moisture. Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: According to physicians, honey is more likely to be a remedy for every disease than the black seed. Nevertheless, there are some diseases that if a person drinks honey, it will make matters worse. If what is meant by the description of honey as something “wherein is healing for men” [an-Nahl 16:69] is that it is healing for most diseases, then it is more appropriate to say that with regard to the black seed. End quote. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words “healing from every disease” are like the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Destroying everything by the Command of its Lord” [al-Ahqaaf 46:25]. That is, it (the storm or wind referred to in the previous verse) destroyed everything that could be destroyed, and the like. End quote. Zaad al-Ma‘aad (4/297) Shaykh Abu Muhammad ibn Abi Jamrah said: Some people commented on this hadith and made its general statements specific, referring it to the views of people who have medical experience, but the one who says that is obviously mistaken, because if we believe the physicians – whose knowledge is based on experience, the foundation of which is what is most likely to be right – then to believe the one who does not speak on the basis of his whims and desires [i.e., the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] is more appropriate [than believing the doctors]. End quote from al-Fath (10/145). Al-Karmaani said: It may be that the general meaning is the intended meaning, that it may bring healing for all diseases, but that is on condition that it is put together with other ingredients, and there should be no haraam component. Rather the general meaning of the text must be what is intended, because the fact that an exception is mentioned indicates that it is general in application. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said it intending that general meaning; the evidence for that is the fact that he made an exception. Therefore we must accept that it is general in meaning. End quote. ‘Umdat al-Qaari (31/301) The fact that the general meaning is what was intended is obvious, because the wording indicates that. It is also indicated by the exception in the phrase “except as-saam (death).” If the general meaning had not been intended, there would have been no need to mention the exception. The fact that an exception is made for death indicates that for all other diseases, black seed may be useful as a remedy, but that is dependent upon there being no impediment and upon the conditions being met. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Just taking appropriate means and measures does not necessarily lead to the expected results. If rain falls and seeds sprout, that is not sufficient for vegetation to grow; rather it is also essential that there be fecundating winds, by Allah’s leave, and it is essential that there be an absence of impediments. It is essential for all conditions to be met and all impediments to be absent, and all of that happens by the will and decree of Allah. A child is not born as the result of merely depositing semen in the vagina. How often that happens, but no child is born. Indeed it is essential that Allah should will to create the child, then the woman conceives, then the embryo begins to grow in the uterus, and all other conditions that are needed, and the impediments that must be absent, for the creation of a child. End quote. Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (8/70) Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Many people do not benefit from the means and measures, or from ruqya done by reciting Qur’an or other words, because the conditions are not met and the impediments are not absent. If every sick person could be healed by means of ruqya or medical treatment, no one would die. But it is Allah, may He be glorified, in Whose hand is control of healing. If He wills that, He makes the means thereof easily available, and if He does not will that, the means will be to no avail. End quote. Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz (8/61) Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that the way to treat disease using the black seed varies from one disease to another, and he said: What is meant by this seed being a healing for every disease is that it should not be used on its own; rather it may be used on its own or with other ingredients. It may be used ground up or otherwise, and it may be eaten, drunk, used like snuff, applied as a poultice, and in other ways. End quote from al-Fath (10/144). The ways in which it is used vary according to what people of experience and knowledge suggest, or what modern medical research suggests, based on experience and on the properties of the black seed and its effect on disease. Al-Bukhaari (5687) narrated that Khaalid ibn Sa‘d said: We went out, and Ghaalib ibn Abjar was with us, and he fell sick. When we came to Madinah he was still sick. Ibn Abi ‘Ateeq visited him and said to us: You should use this little black seed: take five or seven of them and grind them, then mix it with olive oil and put drops in his nose, on this side, and on this side, for ‘Aa’ishah told me that she heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “This black seed is a healing for every disease except as-saam.” I said: What is as-saam? He said: Death. Based on that, there is nothing wrong with stipulating that the black seed should be taken in a particular manner, according to the type of sickness, on condition that this method is proven to be beneficial, either from experience or on the basis of scientific research. As for stipulating that Soorat al-Ikhlaas should be recited three times, or that a particular du‘aa’ (supplication) should be recited, there is no basis for such stipulations. Secondly: With regard to the questioner stating that he wishes for death constantly because of the pain caused by his sickness, this is contrary to what Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) have stipulated of patience in the face of calamity and acceptance of the divine decree. Allah, may He be exalted, tests His slave so as to expiate his bad deeds and raise him in status. It was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2398), who classed it as saheeh, that Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: O Messenger of Allah, which of the people are most sorely tested? He said: “The Prophets, then the righteous, then the next best, then the next best of people. A man will be tested according to his level of religious commitment. If there is some solidness in his religious commitment, he will be more sorely tested, and if there is some weakness in his religious commitment the test will be lightened for him. A man will continue to be tested until he walks upon the face of the earth with no sin on him.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi. Al-Bukhaari (6351) and Muslim (2680) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should wish for death because of some harm that has befallen him. If he must wish for it, then let him say: ‘O Allah, keep me alive so long as living is good for me, and cause me to die when death is good for me.’” An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that it is clearly disallowed to wish for death because of some harm that befalls one, such as sickness, poverty, trials caused by an enemy, and other worldly hardships. It also indicates that if a person feels that he cannot bear patiently the situation in which he finds himself, being tested with sickness and the like, then let him say, “O Allah, keep me alive so long as living is good for me…”, But it is better to be patient and be content with the divine decree. End quote. What you must do is be patient with that which Allah has decreed for you, and look for the good consequences, which are forgiveness of sins and a great reward, if you are patient. “Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning” [az-Zumar 39:10]. A long life is better for the believer, because he may increase his righteous deeds thereby. Muslim (2682) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should wish for death or pray for it before it comes to him. When one of you dies, his good deeds come to an end. A longer life of a believer is nothing but good for him.” More information, please see the answer to question no. 71236. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to grant you healing, good health and well-being and in this world and the hereafter. And Allah knows best."
401,"What are the things which, if the person who is performing tawaaf does them, do not spoil his tawaaf?",Question What are the things that do not spoil tawaaf and do not make it essential to start it all over again?,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: One of the conditions of tawaaf being valid is doing the circuits consecutively, in the sense that the seven circuits are done one after another, without any lengthy interruption between them. See: al-Mughni (5/248) If a person does two circuits, then interrupts his tawaaf for an hour, for example, in order to go and look for his friend or to sit and chat with him, his tawaaf is rendered invalid and he must start all over again. But if the interruption is brief, such as if it is for a minute or so, then that does not spoil tawaaf. The scholars granted a concession to the person performing tawaaf if a bier is brought for the funeral prayer, or the iqaamah (call immediately preceding an obligatory prayer) is given; in that case he may pray and then complete his tawaaf, and does not have to start all over again. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (8/213): The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that if a person begins tawaaf, then the iqaamah is given for an obligatory prayer, he may interrupt his tawaaf and pray with the congregation, then he may resume his tawaaf, because he did something that is prescribed, so it did not spoil his tawaaf, like a brief action. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Continuity between the circuits of tawaaf is an essential condition, but some of the scholars granted a concession for things such as the funeral prayer, or becoming tired and resting for a moment, then resuming tawaaf, and so on. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen (22/296) He also said: With regard to tawaaf and sa‘i, it is stipulated that it be done continually, which means making the circuits consecutive. If there is a lengthy interruption between them, the first circuits are rendered invalid, and the individual must start tawaaf all over again. But if the interruption is brief, such as if he sits down for two or three minutes, then gets up and completes his tawaaf, there is nothing wrong with that. But if the interruption lasts for an hour or two, then this is a lengthy interruption which means that he must repeat tawaaf. End quote from al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri (16/22) The shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If a person does four circuits of tawaaf, then he interrupts tawaaf because of prayer or the crowds, then completes it after that, after an interruption of twenty-five minutes, what is the ruling on this tawaaf? He replied: This tawaaf was interrupted by a lengthy interruption; if he had interrupted it for the prayer, that would have been a brief interruption, because the prayer does not take longer than ten minutes, or quarter of an hour, or thereabouts. But twenty-five minutes is a lengthy interruption which makes it invalid to connect the circuits to one another. Based on that, he must repeat his tawaaf in order for it to be valid, because tawaaf is a single act of worship, so it is not possible to do its parts piecemeal, with interruptions of twenty-five minutes or more between its parts. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen (22/296) Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: We did tawaaf al-ifaadah, and when we began tawaaf, in the first circuit we completed it, but the crowds were too much, so we went up to the second floor (of the mosque) to complete our tawaaf there. But we were still not able to complete it because the crowds were too much, so we went up onto the roof and we completed the remaining circuits on the roof. Is the tawaaf we did in this manner valid, or do we have to repeat it? He replied: It is valid, and you are excused, although it would have been better for you to be patient and put up with the crowds in the courtyard. But because you found it too difficult and you went up to the second floor and did one or two more circuits there, but you were not able to complete it, so you went up to the roof, all of that is excused. End quote from the shaykh’s website: http://ibn-jebreen.com/books/8-224-7689-3317.htm Secondly: One of the conditions of tawaaf being valid, according to the majority of scholars, is being free of minor impurity. So if the person who is performing tawaaf loses his wudoo’, his tawaaf is rendered invalid – according to this view – and he has to do wudoo’ and repeat his tawaaf. However there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning this matter, which has been discussed in fatwa no. 34695 Thirdly: Tawaaf is not spoiled by eating, drinking, sleeping or speaking. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is makrooh (disliked) for the person performing tawaaf to eat whilst doing it, and the objection to his drinking is less emphatic, but tawaaf is not rendered invalid by either or both of these actions. Ash-Shaafa‘i said: There is nothing wrong with drinking water whilst doing tawaaf and it is not makrooh – in the sense of it being a sin – but I prefer not doing that, because not doing it is better in terms of etiquette. End quote from al-Majmoo‘ (6/46) He also said: If a person falls asleep whilst doing tawaaf or partway through it, in a way that does not invalidate his wudoo’, then the more correct view is that his tawaaf is still valid in that case. End quote from al-Majmoo‘ (8/16) Al-Khateeb ash-Sharbeeni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he falls asleep whilst doing tawaaf in a manner that does not invalidate his wudoo’, his tawaaf is not spoiled. End quote from Mughni al-Muhtaaj (2/244) Limiting sleep to that which does that not invalidate wudoo’ is based on what is referred to above of the difference of scholarly opinion concerning that, which is whether being free of minor impurity is essential in order for tawaaf to be valid. Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: Talking whilst doing tawaaf is permissible, but it is better for the Muslim who is circumambulating the House of Allah, may He be exalted, to focus on worship, dhikr and du‘aa’, and not to be distracted by ordinary talk, because being distracted by ordinary talk is contrary to what is preferable. But that does not affect the validity of his tawaaf. Permissible kinds of talk do not affect the validity of tawaaf, although not doing that is preferable. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan (2/485) And Allah knows best."
402,He is asking about playing recordings of the takbeer during the days of Eid,"Question Some shopkeepers put big loudspeakers in their shops and at the doors of their shops, from which comes the sound of the takbeer – takbeeraat al-Eid – during the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah. What is the ruling on that? Should it be disallowed? Does it come under the heading of bid‘ah (innovation)? Is our instructing the students at the beginning of class during the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah to recite the takbeer, so as to revive the Sunnah, a kind of bid‘ah?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: What is required is for the people to recite the takbeer and magnify Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, during the days of Eid, and to do so openly. Raising the volume of recordings of the takbeeraat of Eid is something that will alert the negligent and remind those who forget, so it is prescribed in that sense, so long as it does not cause annoyance to people or disturb them with its loud volume, and so long as it is not done excessively. We do not say that it comes under the heading of bid‘ah (innovation), because innovation only refers to something for which there was a reason during the era of the righteous early generations (as-salaf as-saalih), but they did not do it; that is what an innovation is. As for devices that play audio recordings, this is something new that did not exist during earlier times, as is well known. With regard to such things that are set up at the doorways of shops and the like, to remind people of the dhikr for entering and exiting a place, and other regular adhkaar, it does not seem that there is anything wrong with any of that. Secondly: As reciting the takbeer during these days is prescribed and is part of the Sunnah, then urging people to do it is also prescribed, in general terms, and at all times, whether that is before or after lessons in schools, when it is appropriate to do so and it will not cause students to miss out on any obligatory duties or to fall short in doing other work. It should not be limited to the beginning or end of classes; rather it should be done whenever it is possible for them to do it. If the teacher enters his classroom reciting takbeer so that his students will follow his example, or he instructs them to do it and encourages them to do it, that is Islamically acceptable and is guiding others to righteousness and piety. Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh (2/20) that Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Hurayrah used to go out to the marketplace during the first ten days [of Dhu’l-Hijjah] reciting takbeer, and the people would recite takbeer, following their example. But that is on condition that he does not tell the students to recite it in unison. See also the answer to question no. 127851 . And Allah knows best."
403,Whoever does not believe that the kaafirs are kaafirs is himself a kaafir,"Question Is it true that anyone who does not accept that kuffaar are kuffaar is a kaafir himself, even if he prays, believes in the Qur'aan, and the Prophet Muhammad ( )? If so, what is the proof for this? Can a person insist on believing that Jews and Christians can be believers and go to heaven after being shown clear evidence against this, and still be considered a Muslim?","Praise be to Allah.Yes, this is correct. Whoever is not convinced that the person who disbelieves in the religion of Allaah is a kaafir, does not believe what Allaah has told us about their being kaafirs, and he does not believe that the religion of Islam abrogates all previous religions and that all people must follow this religion no matter what their religion was before. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers [Aal Imraan 3:85] Say (O Muhammad): O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah [al-Araaf 7:158] Al-Qaadi Ayyaad said: hence we regard as a kaafir everyone who follows a religion other than the religion of the Muslims, or who agrees with them, or who has doubts, or who says that their way is correct, even if he appears to be a Muslim and believes in Islam and that every other way is false, he is a kaafir (Al-Shifaa bi Tareef Huqooq al-Mustafaa, 2/1071) Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Know that among the greatest things that can nullify Islam are ten things: Associating othes in worship of Allaah alone, Who has no partner or associate. The evidence ofr that is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, Allaah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that [al-Nisaa 4:116]. This also includes offering scarifices to other than Allaah, such as to the jinn or at graves. Whoever regards others as intermediaries between him and Allaah and calls upon them to ask them to intercede for him, is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus. Whoever does not regard the Mushrikeen as kaafirs or doubts that they are kaafirs or regard their way as correct, is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus. After enumerating them, he said (may Allaah have mercy on him): In the case of all these things that nullify Islam, there is no difference whether a person is joking or is serious or is afraid except in cases where he is forced to do something. All of them are among the things that are very dangerous and which happen very often. The Muslim has to beware of them and fear them happening to him. We seek refuge with Allaah from the things that earn His wrath and His painful prunishment, May Allaah bless Muhammad. (Muallafaat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhaab, 212, 213). Shirk and kufr are the same when it comes to the ruling (hukm) Ibn Hazm said: Kufra and shirk are the same; every kaafir is a mushrik and every mushrik is a kaafir. This is the view of al-Shaafa and others. (al-Fisl, 3/124). The Jews and Christians are kuffaar and mushrikeen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And the Jews say: Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaahs Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth! They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allaah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Tauraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God Allaah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him). [al-Tawbah 9:30-31]. It was reported from Abu Hurayrag that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: By the One is Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, not one of this nation, Jew or Christian, will hear of me and will die without having believed in that with which I have been sent, but he will be one of the dwellers of Hell fire. (Narrated by Muslim, 153) Whoever says that the Jews are not kaafirs is disbelieving in the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meanings): And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief [al-Baqarah 2:93] Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: We hear your word (O Muhammad) and disobey, and Hear and let you (O Muhammad) hear nothing. And Raaina [in Arabic it means Be careful, listen to us, and we listen to you, whereas in Hebrew, it means an insult] with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islâm). And if only they had said: We hear and obey, and Do make us understand, it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allaah has cursed them for their disbelief [al-Nisa 4:46] Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allaah, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly, and of their saying: Our hearts are wrapped (with coverings, i.e. we do not understand what the Messengers say) nay, Allaah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, so they believe not but a little. And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse); And because of their saying (in boast), We killed Messiah Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allaah, but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them the resemblance of Eesaa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)] [al-Nisa 4:155-157] Verily, those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allaah and His Messengers (by believing in Allaah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, We believe in some but reject others, and wish to adopt a way in between. They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment [al-Nisa 4:150-151] Whoever says that the Christians are not kuffaar is disbelieving in the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meanings): Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary) [al-Maaidah 5:17] Surely, disbelievers are those who said: Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity). But there is no Ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God Allâh). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them [al-Maaidah 5:73] And he is disbelieving in the words of Allaah concerning the Jews and Christians who do not believe in our Prophet or follow him: Verily, those who disbelieve in Allaah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allaah and His Messengers (by believing in Allaah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, We believe in some but reject others, and wish to adopt a way in between. They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment [al-Nisa 4:150-151] What is there left to say after these clear statements from Allaah, may He be exalted? We ask Allaah to guide us. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
404,Her husband only has intercourse with her every four months,"Question If a husband has sex with his wife every four (on a constant basis) months but it does not fulfill the woman's sexual needs, then is there any Islamic recourse that a woman can take concerning this matter? Is it fair that a man can have sex with his wife everyday but the wife can only have sex every four months with her husband? (after all it is not like she can marry another man to satisfy her needs, but her husband has ample room to satisfy his needs).","Praise be to Allah.This action is undoubtedly wrong, and it is contrary to good treatment of one's wife. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably” [al-Nisa 4:19] “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable” [al-Baqarah 2:228] And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who are best to their wives.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. It follows from this that the husband has to have intercourse with his wife in the manner that is sufficient to meet her needs. It is not a part of living with her honourably to forsake her for this length of time, namely four months. If that causes harm to the woman, then she has the right to demand an annulment of the marriage, With regard to the comment made by some of the scholars, that the husband only has to have intercourse with his wife once every four months, this is a weak view, for which there is no clear saheeh (sound) evidence. The correct view is that he has to have intercourse with his wife as often as will satisfy her needs, because of the shar’i principles mentioned above."
405,What should they do with a watercooler that is no longer used by the people of the mosque?,"Question What is the ruling on selling a large watercooler that was placed next to the mosque on the outside, which someone donated as a waqf for the mosque, but it was not used; rather it is unused and no one drinks from it. That is because there is a cooler inside the mosque, from which the people drink, and they ignore the one that is outside. What is the ruling on selling it and using the price to pay for things that the mosque needs, or giving it to some other place to make use of it, in the case that it cannot be sold? It will be moved to a place where people gather, such as a military barracks, for example.","Praise be to Allah.Attention must be paid to the intention of the one who gave it as a waqf and the conditions he stipulated. It is not permissible to dispose of a waqf in a manner different to what was intended by the donor or what he stipulated, except in cases where doing so is necessary. An example of what is necessary is when the waqf is unused and no one is benefitting from it. In that case, it may be moved to the closest thing to what the original donor intended. Since the donor of this cooler gave it as a waqf to the mosque, and it is not possible to use it in that particular mosque, it may be moved to another mosque where it will be made use of. If there is no mosque that needs it, then it may be moved to any place where people gather, such as a military barracks and so on. Based on that, it should not be moved to the military barracks unless there is no mosque that needs it. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to move a waqf that was given to the mosque, such as a cupboard, if it is too big for the mosque and the mosque has no need of it? He replied: Yes, it is permissible to move the waqf if that serves a greater purpose. If something is not needed in the mosque – such as a carpet, cupboard or anything else – we may move it to another mosque, if possible. If that is not possible, we can sell these things and spend their price on the mosque. But if it belongs to the Ministry of Awqaaf, then they should dispose of it in the way that is most appropriate. End quote. ""Liqa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh (168)"". See also the answers to questions no. 11247 and 50407 . With regard to selling it, that is not permissible so long as it is possible for it to be used in another place, because the donor intended to benefit people by supplying this cold water, so this aim should be taken into consideration. And Allah knows best."

If you find anything difficult to understand then ask the scholars in your country or write to other Sunni scholars for advice. We also advise you to remember Allah a great deal (dhikr) with the dhikrs narrated in the saheeh ahaadeeth, such as “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god except Allah)”, “Subhaan-Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god except Allah and Allah is Most Great)”, and so on. For more information on this see al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Ibn Taymiyah; al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim; Riyaadh al-Saaliheen [available in English]; al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah by Imaam al-Nawawi, and so on. Remembering Allah (dhikr) increases faith and brings peace of mind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest” [al-Ra’d 13:28] Regularly perform acts of worship such as prayer, fasting and the other pillars of Islam, whilst hoping for the mercy of Allah and putting your trust in Him in all your affairs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Quran) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone); Who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑ Salaah) and spend out of that We have provided them. It is they who are the believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (Paradise).” [al-Anfaal 8:2] Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, 3/185, 186 2 – Faith is also increased by obeying Allah, and it decreases when one disobeys Him. So adhere to doing that which Allah has enjoined such as performing the prayers on time in congregation in the mosque, praying zakaah willingly to purify yourself of sin and show compassion towards the poor and needy, sitting with good and righteous people so that they will help you to apply sharee’ah and guide you to that which will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. Avoid the followers of bid’ah and sinners, lest they tempt you and weaken your resolve to do good. Do a lot of voluntary good actions, turn to Allah, and ask Him for strength. If you do that, Allah will increase you in faith and you will make up for lost time, and Allah will increase you in goodness and steadfastness in adhering to Islam. Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, 3/187."
407,The right to custody when the spouses are still married; does the mother have the right to travel with her children?,"Question I am married and living in Saudi, but my husband wants to send me to my family in Palestine, ostensibly for the purpose of a family visit. This is because of some problems between my husband’s family and my family, but his intention is to send me for the purpose of putting pressure on my family to fulfil his demands and also to keep me away from my children, as a means of putting further pressure on me and on my family too. He has clearly admitted this. What is the solution to this matter? Is it permissible for me to demand that my children should come with me, seeking the help of the police, before I travel and leave Saudi, because of what he has admitted? As I mentioned at the beginning, I am going to travel to my family, and I am married and am not divorced.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Custody means taking care of the child, raising him and looking after his affairs. When the parents are still married, custody belongs to both of them. Ad-Dardir said in ash-Sharh al-Kabir (2/526): If the husband is still alive and she is still married to him, then it (custody) belongs to both of them. End quote. In al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (17/301), it says: The custody of the child belongs to both parents if they are still married. End quote. In that case, the father does not have the right to separate the children from their mother’s care for a long time that is longer than the period for which a mother may customarily be away from her children without any legitimate shar‘i reason for doing that. Secondly: The place of custody is the house in which the father of the child in question lives. The wife (the mother) does not have the right to travel with her children, even if they are small, except with the permission of their father, whether she is travelling to move away permanently, or for some temporary reason such as visiting and the like. It says al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (17/308): The place of custody is the house where the father of the child in question lives; this applies if one who is taking care of him is his mother and is still married to his father, or is observing ‘iddah following a revocable or irrevocable divorce. That is because the wife is obliged to follow her husband and to live with him wherever he lives, and the woman who is observing ‘iddah must remain in the marital home until the end of her ‘iddah, whether she has a child or not, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Do not turn them out of their [husbands'] houses, nor should they [themselves] leave [during that period] unless they are committing a clear immorality} [at-Talaq 65:1]. The husband does not have the right to turn his wife out of the marital home without a legitimate shar‘i reason that makes it permissible for him to do that, because shelter is one of the rights that the wife has over her husband, and he has no right to withhold that from her or to cause her trouble for no legitimate reason. She also has no right to leave the marital home without the permission of her husband. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O Prophet, when you [Muslims] divorce women, divorce them for [the commencement of] their waiting period and keep count of the waiting period, and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not turn them out of their [husbands'] houses, nor should they [themselves] leave [during that period] unless they are committing a clear immorality. And those are the limits [set by] Allah. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself. You know not; perhaps Allah will bring about after that a [different] matter} [at-Talaq 65:1]. If in the case of a woman who is revocably divorced it is haram for the husband to turn her out of his house, and it is haram for her to leave the marital home for no legitimate shar‘i reason that would make it permissible for her to do that, then it is more appropriate that this should apply in the case of a wife who is still married (and is not divorced). This is quite clear, in sha Allah. The husband has no right to prevent his wife from living in her house that he provided for her when there is no good reason for doing that, and she also has no right to leave him and leave his house. Based on that, it is forbidden for the husband to turn her out of her house or to send her to her family with the aim of causing harm to her. Whoever causes harm to someone else, Allah will cause harm to him. He has no right to use his wife to put pressure on her family concerning a problem between him and them, or between the two families. This is furthest removed from kind treatment and noble character. Thirdly: If the children are small and it becomes clear that the husband wants to harm his wife by insisting that she travel without them, especially if she does not want to travel in the first place, then she may try to get some trustworthy and righteous people among their acquaintances to mediate, and she may try to talk to her husband, advising him to keep his household, his wife and his children away from getting involved in disputes as much as possible, and he should be above using his wife as a means to put pressure on her family or holding her accountable for the mistakes of others or the mistakes of her family, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another} [al-An‘am 6:164]. If that is not possible, and she cannot put up with the harm that is being done to her, then she may refer the matter to the shar‘i court to decide about it. And Allah knows best."
408,Responding to the muezzin is better than reading Qur’aan,"Question If the muezzin gives the call to prayer whilst I am reading Qur’aan in the mosque, should I carry on reading and after the adhaan I can repeat the adhaan as if I am repeating after the muezzin, or should I repeat it when the muezzin is saying it?.","Praise be to Allah.If a person is reading Qur’aan and the muezzin gives the call to prayer, it is better for him to stop reading and focus on following the muezzin, in obedience to the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “When you hear the muezzin, say what he says” (narrated by Muslim, 384); and delaying it will mean you miss the right time for doing it, which is the time of the adhaan. Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When he hears the muezzin, he should stop reading and follow the muezzin, repeating the words of the adhaan and iqaamah, then go back to his reading. This is what is agreed upon by our companions. End quote from al-Tibyaan fi Adaab Hamlat al-Qur’aan, 126. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If the muezzin gives the call to prayer whilst a person is reading Qur’aan, is it better for him to repeat after him and say what he says, or should he focus on reading Qur’aan on the grounds that it is better and one should give precedence to that which is better? He replied: The Sunnah, if one is reading Qur’aan and hears the adhaan, is to respond to the muezzin, following the teaching of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “When you hear the muezzin, say what he says, then send blessings upon me, for whoever sends blessings upon me, Allaah will send blessings upon him tenfold. Then ask Allaah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a station in Paradise which only one of the slaves of Allaah will attain, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me, intercession will be permissible for him.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him). In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from the hadeeth of Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When you hear the muezzin, say what he says.” In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer, ‘Allaahummah Rabba haadhihi’l-da’wat il-taammah wa’l-salaat il-qaa’imah, aati Muhammadan al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah, wab’athhu maqaaman mahmoodan alladhi wa’adtahu (O Allaah, Lord of this perfect Call and the Prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege and also the eminence, and resurrect him to the praised position that You have promised), will be granted my intercession on the Day of Resurrection.” al-Bayhaqi added with a hasan isnaad: “innaka la tukhlif al-mi‘aad (Verily You never break Your promise).” And because answering the muezzin is a Sunnah which will be missed out if he carries on reading, whereas he will not miss out on reading because the times when he can read are plentiful. May Allah help and guide us all. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 10/358 And it may be the case that what is less virtuous may become more virtuous in certain cases. For example, reading Qur’aan is one of the best kinds of dhikr and the Qur’aan is the best of dhikr. If a man is reading Qur’aan and hears the muezzin gave the call to prayer, is it better for him to carry on reading or to answer the muezzin? In this case we say: it is best to answer the muezzin, even though Qur’aan is better than dhikr. Dhikr at the appropriate time is better than reading Qur’aan, because reading Qur’aan is not connected to a specific time; whenever you want to you can read it, but responding to the muezzin is connected to hearing the adhaan. End quote from Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh. And Allah knows best."
409,How to Become a Muslim?,Question How to become a Muslim and how to take shahadah?,"Praise be to Allah.All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the universe. May peace and blessings of Allah be upon Mohammad, His last Messenger. Do you need witnesses to become a Muslim? The purpose of this answer is to correct a false idea spread among those willing to adopt Islam as their faith. Some people have a wrong notion that entering into the Islamic fold requires an announcement from the concerned person in the presence of high ranking scholars or shaykhs or reporting this act to courts of justice or other authorities. It is also thought that the act of accepting Islam, should, as a condition, have a certificate issued by the authorities, as evidence to that effect. Is it difficult to become a Muslim? We wish to clarify that the whole matter is very easy and that none of these conditions or obligations are required. For Allah, Almighty, is above all comprehension and knows well the secrets of all hearts. Nevertheless, those who are going to adopt Islam as their religion are advised to register themselves as Muslims with the concerned governmental agency, as this procedure may facilitate for them many matters including the possibility of performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) and ‘Umrah. How to convert to Islam and become a Muslim? If anyone has a real desire to be a Muslim and has full conviction and strong belief that Islam is the true religion ordained by Allah for all human-beings, then, one should pronounce the “shahadah ”, the testimony of faith, without further delay. The Noble Quran is explicit in this regard as Allah states: “The Religion in the sight of Allah is Islam” (Quran 3:19) In another verse of the Quran, Allah states: “If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), Never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (their selves in the Hellfire).” (Quran 3:85) In addition, Islam is the only religion prevailing over all other religions. Allah states in the Quran: “To thee We sent the Scripture in the truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety:…. (Quran 5:48) Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him), said: “The superstructure of Islam is raised on five (pillars): testifying that there is no God (none truly worthy of worship) but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, performing the prayer, paying the Zakah (poor-due), fasting the month of Ramadan, and performing Hajj.” How to pronounce Shahada The Shahadah can be declared as follows: “ASH-HADU ALLA ILAHA ILLA-ALLAH WA ASH-HADU ANNA MUHAMMADAN RASUL-ALLAH”. Shahada in English The English translation of the shahadah is: “I bear witness that there is no deity (none worthy of worship) but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.” Conversion to Islam should be based on full conviction However, it would not be sufficient for anyone to only utter this testimony orally either in private or in public; but rather, he should believe in it in his heart with a firm conviction and unshakeable faith. If one is truly sincere and complies with the teachings of Islam in all his life, he will find himself a new born person. This will move him to strive more and more to improve his character and draw nearer to perfection. The light of the living faith will fill his heart until he becomes the embodiment of that faith. What would be next after declaring oneself a Muslim? One should then know the real concept underlying this testimony which means the oneness of Allah and meet its requirements. One must behave accordingly, applying this true faith to everything one speaks or does. The meaning of the Shahadah What do the words of the “Shahadah” signify? The significant point which every Muslim must know very well is the truth that there is no God (deity) to be worshipped other than Allah. He-glory be to Him – is the only true God, Who Alone deserves to be worshipped, since He is the Giver of life and Sustainer and Nourisher of mankind and all creation with His unlimited bounties. Man must worship Allah, Who Alone is worthy of worship. The second part of the Shahadah “i.e., Wa Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluh” means that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) is the servant and chosen Messenger of Allah. No one must have two opinions about this matter. In fact the Muslim has to obey the commands of the Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him), to believe him in what he has said, to practise his teachings, to avoid what he has forbidden, and to worship Allah alone according to the message revealed to him, for all the teachings of the Prophet were in fact revelation and inspirations conveyed to him by Allah. What is worship according to Islam? What is the meaning of worship ? It simply means rendering sincere service, showing reverence for Allah. In a deeper shade of meaning, it implies total submission and complete obedience to Allah’s commandments both in utterances and actions of man whether explicit or implicit. What are the forms of worship in Islam? Worship falls into two categories: Visible (manifest or outward). Invisible (concealed or inward). Visible worship includes acts such as uttering the two parts of the “Shahadah”, performing prayers, giving Zakah (the poor-due), recitation of the Quran, supplication, adoring Allah by praising Him, purifying our bodies before prayers, etc. This type of worship is associated with movement of the parts of the human body. Invisible worship is to believe in Allah, in the Day of Judgement (in the Hereafter), in the Angels, in the Books of Allah, in the prophets of Allah, in the Divine Decree of destiny (that good and bad are determined by Allah Alone). This type of worship does not involve movement of parts of the body but it surely has bearing on one’s heart which subsequently affects one’s way of life. It should be borne in mind that any worship not dedicated to Allah Alone will be rejected as one form of polytheism and this causes apostasy from the Islamic fold. What’s after taking shahadah? The next step for a new revert to Islam is to purify himself by taking a complete bath. He should then resolve to comply with the principles and rules of Islam in their entirety. He should disown all forms of polytheism and false beliefs. He should reject evil and be righteous. Such rejection of evil and being righteous is one of the requisites of the motto of Islam – that is, La ilaha illallah . Allah states in the Holy qur’an: “…whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks…” (Quran 2:256). We have to consider that when we declare from our heart that “there is no god (deity) worthy to be worshipped but Allah”, it implies on our part love, devotion, faith and obedience to the rules of Islamic legislations which are legally binding on all Muslims. It is a requirement of “there is no god worthy to be worshipped but Allah” to love for the sake of Allah and to reject for the sake of Allah. This is the firmest anchor of belief which materializes the meaning of “AL WALA” and “AL BARA”. It means that a Muslim should love and be loyal to his Muslim brothers. He should, as a practice, dissociate himself completely from the unbelievers and refuse to be influenced by them, both in worldly and religious matters. We conclude with a humble prayer to Allah that may He cleanse the hearts and souls of those who are genuine seekers of truth and may He bless the community of believers. For more about Islam, please see these answers: 10446 and 13569 . And Allah knows best."
410,His reputation has been tarnished – what should he do?,"Question What is one to do when being accused of slander and fitnah ,when there is no truth in the matter?.","Praise be to Allah. You should note that it has been proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for it is all good, and this does not apply to anyone except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 2999. This hadeeth indicates that all the believer’s affairs are good, because he alternates between gratitude and patience, and there is reward in both. You should also note that the best of people, the Messengers (peace be upon them) were slandered by their enemies. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: ‘A sorcerer or a madman!’” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:52] Even our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was slandered by his enemies and accused of being a sorcerer or a madman. Indeed, things got so bad that the hypocrites impugned his honour, but despite that he bore it all with patience and sought reward from Allaah, and he put his trust in Allaah. “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). 3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3] So you have to be patient and seek reward with Allaah, and remember that this is one of the means by which Allaah expiates your sins. You have the right to defend yourself and establish your innocence of whatever you are accused of, and to denounce as liars those who accuse you of that; this is not regarded as the kind of gheebah (backbiting or gossip) that is forbidden. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah does not like that the evil should be uttered in public except by him who has been wronged” [al-Nisa’ 4:148] If you can confront the one who has accused you and advise him and exhort him to fear Allaah, that is good. Perhaps he will give up what he has been doing and that will be a cause of his repenting and following the straight path. Or you could send a wise person to do that. You have to avoid situations and places that may cause doubts and suspicion, because that person may take them as a means to confirm his suspicions. You have to be patient and turn to Allaah, calling upon Him, and Allaah will grant you relief from what you are facing. And Allaah knows best."
411,Important advice to the spouses concerning discussions between them,Question Sometimes my wife wants to discuss an issue with me and she has a valid point but I do not want to discuss it with her. That leads to her getting upset and it ends in an argument. Despite that I do not admit that it was my fault until she comes and tries to reconcile me. Please note that she knows that I am the one who is in the wrong.,"Praise be to Allah.What you have to do is treat your wife kindly. Part of kind treatment is listening properly to what she is saying and responding properly. Being right is not limited to men; it may be your wife’s view that is correct and her suggestions and advice may be good. What is preventing you from letting her express her views and discussing them with her in a friendly manner? Remember how the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) listened to the advice of his wife Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) and adopted it in a matter of great importance. That was during the well-known Treaty of al-Hudaybiyah, when she suggested to him that he should go out and not speak to anyone among his Companions until he had slaughtered his hadiy (sacrificial animal) and shaved his head. Our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did as his wife (may Allah be pleased with her) suggested and there was a great deal of good in that. Hence we advise you to be the one to start a discussion between you and your wife and open your heart and mind to what she has to say, and listen attentively. Then you can either accept what she says and thank her, or reject it gently whilst also thanking her. Do not forget that she is your life partner and the one who is helping you to raise your children and organise your household. So it is not appropriate to close the doors of discussion to her. You should not be too proud of your opinion and or feel that you do not need to discuss with her and hear her opinion. Do not neglect the words of your Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “The best of you is the one who is best to his wife.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 3895; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 3314. Over and above that, do not forget the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “And live with them honourably” [an-Nisa’ 4:19]. Discussion between the spouses increases the love between them and strengthens the bond between them; it also helps to reach the right decision in matters of married life and household and family affairs. Remember that the consequences of this attitude towards your wife may backfire on you; she may refuse to give you any advice so long as you do not accept what she offers you and is forced to agree with you even if you are wrong. Thus you will be depriving yourself of a great deal of good and beneficial advice. It suffices us to say to you: This attitude, in which you insist on your opinion, do not admit your mistakes and do not acknowledge that your wife could be right is the very essence of arrogance, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) defined it. It was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No one will enter Paradise who has an atom’s weight of arrogance in his heart.” A man said: What if a man likes his garment to look nice and his shoes to look nice? He said: “Allah is Beautiful and loves beauty. Arrogance is rejecting truth and looking down on people.” Narrated by Muslim, no. 91 What is meant by rejecting truth is denying it out of arrogance and pride. Looking down on people means scorning them and thinking little of them. Don’t you see that this is the essence of what you are doing with your wife? Are you content to have this attitude and hence this fate may be yours? May Allah protect you from that, O slave of Allah. It is not the attribute of the wise and mature man to insist when he is in the wrong that his wife should be the one to apologise. Rather he is the one who should hasten to admit his mistake, apologise for it and ask his wife to forgive him. And her duty is to apologize to her husband if she is the one who is in the wrong. It is in this way that married life takes a correct course and lasting love and compassion are strengthened between the spouses. Abu’d-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said to his wife: “If you see me angry, try to calm me down, and if I see you angry I shall try to calm you down, otherwise we cannot live together.” See also the answer to question no. 145463 You could also benefit by reading the book The Muslim Home: 40 Recommendations, which you can find in the Articles and Books section of this website. (Link: /en/books/17 ) We ask Allah to guide you and your wife to that which He loves and is pleased with, and to bring you together in the best of ways. And Allah knows best."
412,He is sick and wiping his head will harm him. How should he do wudoo’; can he put something on his head and wipe over it?,Question My question is about wudoo’; I cannot wipe over my head because of a sickness I am suffering. Can I put something to cover my head and wipe over it when I do wudoo’? What if that headcover is removed? Will my wudoo’ still be valid?,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is permissible to wipe over the turban, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (205) from ‘Amr ibn Umayyah, who said: I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) wipe over his turban and khuffayn (leather slippers). The view that it is permissible to wipe over the turban is the view of Imam Ahmad. See the answer to question no. 129557. It is not valid to wipe over the kufi (white skullcap) or other kinds of hats or caps. See the answer to question no. 139719. Secondly: If there is a plaster cast or dressing on your head, then you can wipe over it. That is proven from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is no report concerning that from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)… Rather there are the view of the fuqaha’ among the Taabi‘een and those who came after them, along with what we have narrated from Ibn ‘Umar. He narrated with his isnaad that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did wudoo’ when his hand was bandaged, so he wiped over it and over the bandage, and he washed everything else. He said: This is soundly narrated from Ibn ‘Umar. End quote from al-Majmoo‘ (2/368). Thirdly: If your head is bare, but will be harmed by wiping it, then you should wash all the other parts that are to be washed in wudoo’, and do tayammum instead of of wiping your head. It is not valid for you to put something over your head then wipe over it, unless it is a turban that you are wearing, or a dressing which may result in harm if it is removed. It says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/165): If part of his body is wounded and the like, such as if there is a sore or ulcer, and he will be harmed if he washes it or wipes it with water, he may do tayammum for it, i.e., for the part that is wounded and the like… If he is able to wipe over the part that is wounded and the like with water, then he must do that and that will be sufficient, because washing is enjoined, and wiping is like a lesser form of washing; that is like the case of one who is unable to bow and prostrate, but is able to make gestures. End quote. Shaykh Ibn Baz said: If he has a dressing, he may wipe over it, and if the wound is uncovered, he should do tayammum instead. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (1/169): The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: Wounds and the like are either uncovered or covered. If the wound is uncovered, then it must be washed with water. If it is not possible to wash it with water, then the person should wipe over the wound. If it is not possible to wipe over it, then he should do tayammum. This is the order of preference. If it is covered with something that is (medically) appropriate to his situation, then he has no choice but to wipe over it. If wiping will cause him harm even though it is covered, then he must turn to the option of doing tayammum, as in the case where it is uncovered. This is what was stated by the fuqaha’ (may Allah have mercy on them). End quote. Fourthly: If someone does tayammum for a wound and the like, he may do tayammum before or after doing wudoo’. The Hanbalis regard it as obligatory to follow the same order as wudoo’, by doing tayammum at the point where one would ordinarily wipe the head. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The statement that the one who has a wound may do tayammum for it and wash the rest refers to the case when he has a wound on some part of his body [that is washed in wudoo’], meaning a wound that would be harmed by water. He should do tayammum for the wounded part, and wash all the other parts that are to be washed in wudoo’. With regard to doing tayammum in the case of the wound, it is not stipulated that water be unavailable, so there is nothing wrong with doing tayammum when water is available in this case. The apparent meaning of the author’s words “he should do tayammum instead” is that tayammum must be done in place of washing the injured limb, because it is stipulated that the parts of wudoo’ be done in a particular order. But if the issue is doing ghusl from janaabah when there is a wound, it is permissible to do tayammum before doing ghusl, or immediately afterwards, or after some time has passed. This is our view, because they thought that in the case of ghusl, it is not stipulated that the actions be done in a particular order or straight after one another. If the wound is in the hand, then you must wash your face first, then do tayammum, then wipe your head, then wash your feet. In this case, you must have a towel with you, so that you can dry your face and hands, because it is stipulated that the soil or sand used for tayammum must be dusty and dry, and if there is water on your face, tayammum will not be valid. Some of the scholars said that it is not stipulated that the actions be done in a particular order or straight after one another, as in the case of major impurity. Based on that, it is permissible to do tayammum before or after wudoo’, either immediately afterwards or some time afterwards. This is what people do nowadays, and it is the correct view. It was favoured by al-Muwaffaq, al-Majd, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, who regarded it as sound in Tasheeh al-Furoo‘. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (1/383). And Allah knows best."
413,How to apply patience when faced with tests,"Question How do people react angrily to tests? For example, if Musab ibn Umayr (radiallahu anhu) were to show discontent with his test regarding his mother, then what are some of the things he would have done? To be clear, I am not saying he had shown discontent. I am asking for an example of failing a test but in Musab's case.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The nature of this world is that it is a test. Unless the believer convinces himself of that and instills this idea in his mind, and equips himself with patience (in the face of tests), his life will become more difficult and he will miss out on reward. We Muslims should reflect upon the Book of our Lord and what He has enjoined upon us of patience. We should study the life of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions, and our early generations, and see how they bore tests and hardships with patience, so that we can follow their example. It is no secret that patience brings great reward and high standing before Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and Allah congratulated the patient and gave them glad tidings: “but give good tidings to the patient” [al-Baqarah 2:155]. See the answer to question no. 71236. Secondly: There is nothing in the story of Mus‘ab ibn ‘Umayr (may Allah be pleased with him) to suggest that he panicked or was not patient. Rather what is narrated is that he bore with patience detention in Makkah, and he used to call his mother to become Muslim when he was in chains and detained. There is no report to suggest what is mentioned in the question. Ibn Ishaaq narrated in his Maghaazi that Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas said: We were people who endured a hard life in Makkah with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and faced difficulties. When calamity befell us, we regarded it as a test and bore it with patience. Mus‘ab ibn ‘Umayr was a young man who lived a life of the greatest ease in Makkah, and his garments were the finest, as his parents spent generously on him. Then I saw him, when he became Muslim, looking very tired and unwell, to the extent that I saw his skin peeling off like the skin of a snake.… Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, honoured him with martyrdom on the day of Uhud. End quote from as-Siyar wa’l-Maghaazi, p. 193. Thirdly: Some of the Sahaabah were afflicted with calamity, and they reacted in a way that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) disliked. So he would enjoin them to be patient and teach them the right thing to do and say, and they would correct themselves immediately (may Allah be pleased with them). It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by a woman who was weeping at a grave, and he said: “Fear Allah and be patient.” She said: Leave me alone, for you have not suffered my calamity! And she did not recognise him. It was said to her: He is the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). She came to the door of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and did not find any doorkeepers there. She said: (I am sorry), I did not recognise you. He said: “(True) patience is only when calamity first strikes.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1283) and Muslim (926). Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Baari (3/149). Al-Qurtubi said: What appears to be the case is that there was something excessive in her weeping, such as wailing and the like, hence he told her to fear Allah. I (Ibn Hajar) say: This is supported by the fact that in the mursal report of Yahya ibn Abi Katheer mentioned above, it says: He heard from her something that he disliked, so he stood beside her. At-Teebi said: The words “Fear Allah’ are an introduction to the words “be patient”; it is as if it were said to her: Fear the wrath of Allah if you do not be patient, and do not be impatient, so that you might attain the reward. The words “she did not recognise him” mean: she addressed him in that manner because she did not realise that he was the Messenger of Allah. Muslim added in a report that he narrated: she was mortified, i.e., because of the distress that she felt when she realised that he was the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), out of embarrassment and out of awe and respect for him. What is meant by the Prophet’s words “(True) patience is only when calamity first strikes” is: if someone is able to show patience in the beginning, when feeling that one is about to be overwhelmed by panic and impatience, that is the perfect patience that leads to reward. At-Teebi said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said this in response to her saying, “I did not recognise you.” This was a wise answer; it is as if he was saying to her: You do not have to apologise, for I do not get angry for anything other than the sake of Allah; rather examine yourself. Az-Zayn ibn al-Muneer said: the reason why he answered the woman in that manner when she showed her obedience to what he enjoined of fearing Allah and showing patience, and apologised for what she had said out of grief, was that he explained to her that the correct thing to do with regard to patience is to show patience when calamity first strikes, for that is what brings reward. End quote. This is supported by the report of Abu Hurayrah mentioned above: She said: I will be patient, I will be patient. From this hadith we may learn things other than those mentioned above… Whoever is enjoined to do something good must accept the advice, even if he does not know the one who is giving it. Panic and impatience are forbidden, because he instructed her to fear Allah in addition to instructing her to be patient. It is encouraged to put up with people’s rudeness when offering advice or exhortation. End quote. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Qawl al-Mufeed (2/215): At times of calamity, people respond in four ways: 1. Anger. This is something that may be either felt in the heart, such as when a person is angry with his Lord and is discontent with what Allah has decreed for him, which may lead to disbelief, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And of the people is he who worships Allah on an edge. If he is touched by good, he is reassured by it; but if he is struck by trial, he turns on his face [to the other direction]. He has lost [this] world and the Hereafter” [al-Hajj 22:11]; Or it may be verbal, such as saying, “Woe is me” and the like; Or it may be expressed in physical actions, such as slapping one’s cheeks, rending one’s garment, pulling out one’s hair, and so on. 2. Patience, which is as the poet said: Patience, as the name sounds [in Arabic] is something bitter, but its outcome is sweeter than honey. A person may find something burdensome and dislike it, but he bears it with patience and steadfastness. Whether it happens or not is not the same for him; rather he dislikes what he is going through of hardship, but his faith protects him from becoming discontent. 3. Acceptance (rida), which is of a higher degree than patience. Acceptance is when both ease and hardship are the same to a person, in that he accepts that both happen by the will and decree of Allah, even though he may feel sad when calamity strikes, because he is a man who accepts the divine will and decree; whatever the divine will and decree dictates, he will accept it. The divine will and decree may dictate that he will have either a time of ease or a time of difficulty, either a blessing will be bestowed upon him or a calamity will befall him; it is all the same to him, not because he has no feelings, but because he is completely pleased with his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, and accepts that Allah will cause him to alternate between times of ease and times of hardship, but it is all the same to him, because he thinks of it as being the decree of his Lord concerning him. This is the difference between acceptance and patience. 4. Gratitude. This is the highest status. It means that a person is grateful to Allah for whatever befalls him of calamity, and is thus included among the grateful slaves of Allah. When he realises that there are calamities greater than what has befallen him, and that calamity affecting one’s worldly interests is easier to bear than calamities that affect one’s religious commitment, and that punishment in this world is easier to bear than punishment in the hereafter, and that this calamity may be a means of expiating his sins and increasing his hasanaat, he will give thanks to Allah for that. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No worry, grief or anything else befalls a believer but it becomes an expiation for him, even a thorn that pricks him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. A person may also increase in faith thereby. End quote. Finally: We say to you that what you should ask about and seek to understand is that which will benefit you in terms of your religious commitment and strengthen your faith, not that which may undermine and weaken it. If you want to ask questions, then you should ask about stories of patience and acceptance (of the divine will and decree) among the Sahaabah and righteous early generations, and how they set the best example of steadfastness and patience, and did not panic or become impatient. This is the trait that we should seek out in their biographies, for that is what we should emulate. As for panic and impatience, if that happened, it only reflects a moment of human weakness that should be overlooked and not talked about. In other words, we should not seek it out and ask about it, because it is not an example to be followed. If we knew that a woman showed weakness when calamity befell her and she lost her child, this weakness is not an example to be followed, and it is not anything that is worth seeking out, discussing and asking about. Rather what should be focused on in this story is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to that woman and his instruction to her to be patient, so that we will be careful lest we miss out on the opportunity to show patience. For if we panic in the first instance, until we calm down, come back to our senses and start to think aright, no patience will benefit us at that stage, after showing impatience in the beginning, because true patience is only that which is shown when calamity first strikes. Conclusion: The one who is fortunate and guided should ask about that which will benefit him in both his religious and worldly affairs, not that which may harm him; he should ask about sublime characteristics and not talk about foolish behaviour; he should seek out stories of the righteous early generations in situations in which they set an example to be followed, and not search for and seek out moments of human weakness, from which no one is entirely free as they go through the ups and downs of life. The one who does this is the fortunate one whom Allah has guided to seek beneficial knowledge and look for the right examples to follow. May Allah help us and you to do and say that which He loves. And Allah knows best."
414,"Reconciling between the fact that Salaat al-Haajah is not prescribed and the hadith which states that if something troubled him, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would get up and pray","Question How can we reconcile between the fact that there is no such thing as the prayer called Salaat al-Haajah and the hadith which says that if something troubled him, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would get up and pray, and the verse which says (interpretation of the meaning): “And seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer)” [al-Baqarah 2:45].","Praise be to Allah. Salaat al-haajah is mentioned in a number of da ‘eef hadiths which are not proven to be from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Among these hadiths is the report narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa al-Aslami, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out to us and said: ‘Whoever has need of something from Allah or any one of His creation, let him do wudoo’ and pray two rak’ahs, then let him say, “There is no god but Allah, the Forbearing, the Most Generous. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the mighty Throne. Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah, I ask You for Your mercy and forgiveness and I ask You for all good things and for safety from all sins. I ask You not to leave any sin without forgiving it, or any distress without relieving it, or any need which it pleases You to fulfil without fulfilling it for me.” Then let him ask Allah for whatever matter of this world or the Hereafter that he wishes, for it will be fulfilled.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (1374); this hadith is da‘eef (weak). Al-Tirmidhi said: this is a ghareeb [strange] hadeeth, and concerning its isnaad it was said: Faa’id ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan is weak in hadeeth. Al-Albaani said: rather it is da’eef jiddan (very weak). Al-Haakim said: mawdoo’ (fabricated) ahaadeeth were narrated from Abu Awfa. Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh, vol. 1, p. 417 In Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (8/1 62) it says: That which is called salaat al-haajah was narrated in da‘eef (weak) and munkar (odd) hadiths – as far as we know – that cannot be quoted as evidence. End quote. See also the answer to question no. 10387 With regard to what you mentioned, that if something troubled him, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would get up and pray, this hadith was narrated by Abu Dawood (1319) from the hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him), and classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood (1319) Doing this is prescribed, without reciting any specific du‘aa’ or doing it in any specific manner. Rather if something upset him at the time of an obligatory prayer, he would pray the obligatory prayer, otherwise he would pray two rak‘ahs, and if he wished, he would offer whatever du‘aa’ he liked in them, without always reciting a specific du‘aa’. Ibn Katheer (1/253) said, in his commentary on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning), “And seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer)” [al-Baqarah 2:45]: With regard to the word “As-Salat (the prayer)”, prayer is one of the greatest means of helping oneself to be steadfast, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Recite (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) what has been revealed to you of the Book (the Quran), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat). Verily, As-Salat (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed, etc.) and the remembering (praising, etc.) of (you by) Allah (in front of the angels) is greater indeed (than your remembering (praising, etc.) Allah in prayers, etc.)” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:45]. Then he narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that news was brought to him of his brother’s death whilst he was travelling. He said: “Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji ‘oon (Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return)” [al-Baqarah 2:156]. Then he swerved from the road and made his camel kneel, then he prayed two rak‘ahs in which he made the sitting lengthy. Then he got up and walked towards his camel, saying: “And seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer) and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khashioon (i.e. the true believers in Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:45]. End quote. Based on that, what is meant by saying that there is no prayer that is called salaat al-haajah is to rule out this specific prayer. As for resorting to prayer, for the one who is worried or troubled about something, this is included in the general meaning of the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “And seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer)” [al-Baqarah 2:45] and the meaning of the hadith quoted above. That includes both obligatory and supererogatory prayers. There is no specific du‘aa’; rather a person may offer whatever du‘aa’ he wishes, without adhering to a specific du‘aa’. And Allah knows best."
415,Differences between Christianity and Islam,Question What are the factors which cause a widening gap between Muslim and christian communities?.,"Praise be to Allah.Basic Tenets of Islamic Belief There are many great factors that widen the gaps between Muslims and Christians. The differences in belief between us and them do not let us get close unless they give up their disbelief and misguidance, and join the monotheists who believe in One Lord and God, and bear witness that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His Messenger, and believe that `Isa (Jesus – peace be upon him) was a human being. Basic Tenets of Christian Belief These are the most significant deviations in their religion, which widen the gap between us Muslims and them: The Messiah (peace be upon him) is a god alongside God and that he is the second person of the holy trinity . The Messiah is the son of God . Divinity may be incarnated in humanity. God is formed of three coequal consubstantial divine persons, which is known as the doctrine of the trinity. The Messiah (peace be upon him) was crucified by the Jews on the command of Pontius Pilate, and that he died on the cross. The Messiah died on the cross as a ransom for mankind and as expiation for original sin . The Christian attitude towards the Jews who disbelieved in Jesus (peace be upon him) and claimed that they crucified him and killed him, and they accused his mother Mary (Maryam - peace be upon her) of fornication – of which she was innocent – yet despite all that their attitude towards them today is one of support and loyalty, and their attitude towards the Muslims who venerate Jesus (peace be upon him) and his mother is one of enmity and disavowal. Their distortion of the Book of God, the Gospel (Injil), whether they distorted the words by changing them or by adding words, or they distorted the meaning, and in doing that they attribute things to God that cannot be attributed to Him. The doctrine of redemption, which is their belief that God sent His only son to redeem mankind from a sin committed by the father of mankind (Adam – peace be upon him), but God was unable to forgive his sin, so He sent His only son who had no sin, to sacrifice himself in order to do away with sin. This is an attribution of imperfection to the Lord of the Worlds and a denial of the fact that Adam (peace be upon him) repented and Allah saved the Messiah (peace be upon him) from death. Their disbelief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), even though he is mentioned in the Old and New Testaments. Their belief in the soundness of the distorted Torah that they have in front of them today, which contains insults against God, describing Him as having shortcomings, and insults against the Prophets and Messengers, saying things that one can hardly dare utter, but we mention them in order to highlight the abhorrent nature of the disbelief that they follow. They describe God as weeping with regret for the Flood which drowned the people of Noah, until His eyes became sore, and the angels came to visit Him – exalted be He far above that. They describe Lot (peace be upon him) as committing incest with his two daughters, and Noah (peace be upon him) as drinking wine until he became drunk and his `awrah (private parts) was exposed. There are even more foolish stories than that. See Hidayat al-Hayara fi Ajwibat al-Yahud wa’l-Nasara by Ibn al-Qayyim; Naqd al-Nasraniyyah by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Sahim And Allah knows best."
416,Organizing a gathering to remember the deceased,"Question We have an association for sponsoring orphans. This association mediates between the charitable people and the families of the orphans. The manager of this association has passed away two months ago, may Allah have mercy on him. He was such a great model of sacrifice and loyalty. He was always doing his best to delight and please the families of the orphans. The brothers working here thought of making a meeting to remember him. It is not a commemoration. We decided to make this meeting about his role in the charitable work, and to give his family a certificate of achievement for the efforts the deceased exerted. The meeting includes a word about the activities and achievements of the association. The question: Is it permissible to organize such a meeting?.","Praise be to Allah. Organizing lectures, seminars and meetings to talk about deceased scholars and righteous people or those who did good is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it. But the following conditions should be adhered to: 1 – The purpose should be to encourage people to do good and to express thanks to his family and try to benefit from the bright side of the life of the deceased, and to tell people about him so as to encourage them to follow his example. The aim should not be to stir up grief and sorrow, or remember calamities and pain, or make tears fall and hearts break. Such things have no place in Islam; rather they are contrary to what is enjoined of patience in the face of calamity and acceptance of the will of Allaah. 2 – This gathering should not be made into an “eid” that is repeated every year, because the Muslims have no eid apart from Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha only, and it is not permissible to introduce any eid on any other occasion apart from those that are mentioned in sharee’ah. 3 – Only the truth should be spoken, without exaggerating or boasting. If the deceased was a righteous, knowledgeable and good man, mention may be made of what he did for his ummah and his religion, and that should only be mentioned for the sake of Allaah and so as to encourage people to do good, not to try to attain some position or to show tribal loyalty to a group or party. But if he was a sinner who followed whims and desires or he was one of those who mix good deeds with bad, it is not permissible to deceive the ummah by means of such people and it is not permissible to tell lies by praising them for things that are not true. What we should do is leave their case to Allaah. 4 – These meetings should not be accompanied by any reprehensible actions such as customs of mourning or hanging up pictures or using musical instruments. It is also not permissible to connect such meetings to certain nights such as one week or forty days after the person’s death, and other such myths that are widespread among the common folk. It says in al-Fataawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra by Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (2/18): Ibn ‘Abd al-Salaam said: some kinds of mourning are haraam, such as wailing, because that implies objecting to the divine decree. But if the qualities of a pious scholar or righteous man are mentioned so as to encourage others to follow the same path and think well of him, in that case it is more akin to obedience and exhortation, because of the goodness that may result from it. Hence many of the Sahaabah and scholars did that throughout the ages and were not denounced for it. End quote. It says in the commentary by Ibn al-Shaat on al-Furooq by al-Qarraafi (2?180-182): In fact mourning and eulogizing fall into four categories: haraam and a major sin, haraam and a minor sin, permissible and mandoob (recommended). The guideline on what is haraam and a major sin with regard to eulogizing and commemorating the dead: Any statement which suggests that Allaah has been unfair in His will and decree, such as when they exaggerate in listing the virtues and good qualities and deeds of the deceased which have come to an end with his death, which means that his death was a terrible thing and that it would have been better if he had carried on living. The guidelines on what is haraam and a minor sin: Words that stir up grief and lead to discontent and lack of patience, and may lead to striking one’s cheeks or rending one’s garment. The guidelines on what is permissible with regard to mourning and eulogizing: Words that do no more than mention the religious commitment of the deceased and that he has moved on to the realm of recompense, and that all people will meet the same fate. The guidelines on that which is recommended with regard to mourning and eulogizing: Words which enjoin and encourage the family of the deceased to be patient. End quote. The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: What is the origin of the forty-day commemoration? Is there any evidence that it is prescribed to commemorate the deceased? (They replied:) Firstly: its origin lies in Pharaonic customs, which were known to the Pharaohs before Islam, then they spread to other people. It is a reprehensible innovation that has no basis in Islam, and it is refuted by the proven words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2550). Secondly: Commemorating and eulogizing the deceased in the manner that is known nowadays, where people gather for that purpose and go to extremes in praising him, is not permissible, because of the report which was narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Majaah, and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Awfa who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade eulogizing. And because mentioning the attributes of the deceased is usually boasting, and renews the anguish and stirs up grief. As for simply praising him when he is mentioned or when his funeral passes by, or by telling others of his good deeds and so on, which is akin to the way in which some of the Sahaabah eulogized the slain at Uhud and others, that is permissible, because of the report narrated by Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: A funeral passed by and they spoke well of him, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is guaranteed.” Then another passed by and they spoke ill of him, and he said: “It is guaranteed.” ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “What is guaranteed?” He said: “The one of whom you spoke well, Paradise is guaranteed for him, and the one of whom you spoke ill, Hell is guaranteed for him. You are the witnesses of Allaah on earth.” Agreed upon. End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (9/154-155) Some contemporary scholars regard it as mustahabb for such meetings to be organized a long time after the death, so that the grief will not be renewed. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: In some mosques they give speeches in which they recount the good qualities of the deceased and his good legacy, such as a scholar or a daa’iyah. What is the ruling on this action? Answer: I think that this should not be done, because if it is too close to the death of the scholar or daa’iyah it is regarded as a kind of eulogizing or mourning, and the people are moved to tears by it. But if it is after a long time and after the calamity has been forgotten, and his qualities and legacy are mentioned as a biography, there is nothing wrong with that, because all of the scholars are written about and their qualities and legacy recounted. But as for that which is aimed at stirring up grief and sorrow at the loss of this man, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wailing and this is a kind of wailing. End quote. Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh (no. 207, question no. 15). To sum up: There is nothing wrong with you organizing a memorial meeting to speak of the head of the association, so long as you adhere to the conditions mentioned above. And Allaah knows best."
417,"An invalid marriage contract must be done again, even if ten years have passed","Question My question is that we know that a girl’s marriage without the consent of the guardian is invalid according to the shareeah. Then there are a lot of cases where the couple have eloped and got married. My question is, if the marriage is invalid, how do these people make it valid, lets say after 5 years of marriage or 10years of marriage and they have children now. My other question is that if a couple runs away and gets married and then after certain period, lets say 2years or 4years the parents then give consent or come to acceptance of their marriage, then is the marriage valid. How do some one make this marriage valid?","Praise be to Allah.If a woman gets married without the consent of her wali (guardian), her marriage is invalid and is not valid even if ten years have passed and even if they have children. It is essential to repeat the marriage contract after her guardian’s approval is obtained, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no valid marriage without a wali and two witnesses.” (Narrated by Ahmad and the authors of Sunan except al-Nasaa’i. See Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7558). There is a stern warning against a woman who arranges her own marriage. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A woman should not arrange another woman’s marriage and a woman should not arrange her own marriage, for the zaaniyah (adulteress) is the one who arranges her own marriage.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1782; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7298). With regard to the second question, which has to do with the approval of the wali; in this case it is essential to repeat the marriage contract, because the first nikaah was not valid. The couple must also repent sincerely to Allaah for what they have done, and Allaah is Forgiving, Most Merciful."
418,She works for a company that is partly owned by two riba-based banks. Is her work haraam?,"Question I am single and work for a company that is owned by five different entities, among which are two riba-based banks they are: the Bank of Egypt, which hold 22.5% of the capital and the National Investment Bank, which holds 22.5% of the capital, in addition to a foreign (Chinese) company, which holds 10% of the capital, an Egyptian construction company, which holds 22.5% of the capital; and the Suez Canal Company, which holds 22.5% of the capital. This company which was formed by the above-mentioned entities owns a piece of land and its role is to put in services such as drainage, electricity and water, then they divide it and sell it to investors, a transaction which is either immediate or in instalments, with annual fixed interest of 7%. Please note that these sales sometimes stop. My job in this company is in the secretarial department (administrative work). I used to spend and save from my salary during the period I worked in the company, which was five years, without knowing that this money might be dubious. These savings are in an Islamic bank. Is my work in this company whose earning are mixed halaal or haraam? What is the ruling on what I saved -- which is a large amount? How should I dispose of it? Please advise me and save me from my confusion and torment.","Praise be to Allah. What seems to be the case is that it is permissible to work in this company so long as the work that you are doing is halaal. With regard to working in companies whose work is permissible, the ruling is different with regard to working in banks and other riba-based institutions. In the bank, the employee is sinning whether he is working as a clerk or witness or even as a guard, because the work is haraam in the first place, unlike if the bank has a share in part of the capital of a company whose work is permissible. In this case it depends on the nature of the company's work; for example, it is permissible to work with Jews, Christians and those who deal with riba, although it is makrooh. Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ahmad said: A Muslim may enter into a partnership with a Jew or a Christian, but he should not let the Jew or the Christian be in charge of the financial affairs to the exclusion of the Muslim, because they may engage in riba. This is the view of al-Hasan and al-Thawri. Al-Shaafa’i regarded such partnerships as makrooh in all cases. End quote. Al-Mughni, 5/109 Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Iyaas ibn Mu‘awiyah said: If a Muslim goes into business with a Jew or a Christian, and the money is with the Muslim and he is the one who will do the buying and selling, there is nothing wrong with it, but he should not give it to the Jew or Christian to deal with it, because they deal with riba.

Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 1/93 You will find more details on this issue in the answer to question number 48005, at the beginning of which we said: If a person earns money in haraam ways such as riba, bribes, stealing and cheating, etc., and his wealth is a combination of halaal and haraam, then it is valid to do business with him, buying and selling and entering into partnerships, but it is makrooh. If it is known that the product in which the trade is to be done is haraam in and of itself, then it is not permissible to enter into a partnership with him or work with him in that business.. Based on that, the money that you are taking from this company (the salary) is halaal, in sha Allah, and there is nothing wrong with what you have spent or saved. And Allah knows best."
419,"She is going to get married and live with her husband’s family, and she is asking for advice","Question What advice can you offer a religiously-committed young woman who is about to get married to a man who is not religiously committed, except that he prays, but he does not always go to the mosque, but his reputation is good? She is going to live in her husband’s house with his family, his mother and siblings. This girl had no choice but to agree to this marriage because she is getting older and no religiously-committed young man has proposed marriage to her, who could help her to adhere to her religion. I hope that you can offer her some advice that will help her to remain steadfast in adhering to her religion in these difficult new circumstances, and that you will pray for her to remain steadfast and that she will be able to influence others and not be influenced by them.","Praise be to Allah.We advise this young woman to fear Allaah and remain obedient to Him and strive to please Him, and to help her husband to do good and become righteous. This is something that is possible, praise be to Allaah, but it needs wisdom and patience, and doing the things that lead to love and affection. She should make sure that the home is suitable for her, so that she will not be mixing with her husband’s brothers and relatives who are not her mahrams. The wife has the right to separate accommodation in which she can be at ease with her husband and she should not be forced to live with her husband’s parents or family. If she thinks that the house is suitable for her, then she should pray istikhaarah and ask Allaah for guidance, then she should go ahead and get married, and Allaah will decree good for her wherever it may be. We also advise her to strive to acquire knowledge and teach it, and to spread and revive the Sunnah, and to be the best person who comes to this house. She should remind them to pray and encourage them to do righteous deeds. She should bring them useful tapes and books, and be an example to them in her deeds and attitude. She should always ask Allaah for help, pay attention to her faith and commitment, take stock of herself, and look at her own deeds from time to time. She should know that people influence one another and that if a person does not influence others he will be influenced, so she should hasten to do good. We ask Allaah to help her and bless her with a righteous husband and good offspring. For information on istikhaarah prayer please see question no. 2217. And Allaah knows best."
420,Ruling on shaving the moustache,"Question Some Brothers of mine growing the beard but there are shaving there mustaches. There are saying, that Omar, may Allah be pleased with him, did this and so it is good to do it. I read some answers on your website regarding the trimming of the mustaches, but it is permissible to shave it.","Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the mustahabb Sunnah regarding the moustache, and there are two views: 1- The first view is that it is Sunnah to shave it off altogether. This is the view of the Hanafis and Hanbalis. They quoted as evidence the apparent meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that were narrated concerning this, such as “Trim the moustache” [narrated by al-Bukhaari (5892) and Muslim (259)] and other similar reports in al-Bukhaari and Muslim. Al-Tahhaawi said in Sharh Ma’aani al-Athaar (4/230): Shaving is better than trimming. This is the view of Abu Haneefah, Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad (may Allaah have mercy on them). End quote. Ibn ‘Aabideen narrated in Radd al-Muhtaar (2/550) that later scholars preferred to trim it and said: The (Hanafi) view according to some later scholars among our Shaykhs is that it should be trimmed. It says in al-Badaa’i’: This is the correct view. End quote. 2- The second view is that the Sunnah is to trim the moustache, and that shaving it is makrooh. This is the view of the Maalikis and Shaafa’is. Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) was very strict concerning that. They quoted the following as evidence: (i) It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ""The fitrah is five things: circumcision, shaving the pubes, trimming the moustache, trimming the nails and plucking the armpit hairs."" Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5891) and Muslim (257). (ii) It was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: My moustache grew too long and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) trimmed it for me on a siwaak.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (188); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. Al-Bayhaqi narrated in al-Sunan al-Kubra (1/151) with his isnaad that ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Uwaysi said: Maalik ibn Anas mentioned that some people shave their moustaches, and he said: The one who does that should be beaten. The hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the moustache does not speak of shaving, rather it should be trimmed just enough to let the edge of the lips and the mouth show. Maalik ibn Anas said: Shaving the moustache is a bid’ah (innovation) that has appeared among the people. End quote. Abu’l-Waleed al-Baaji said in al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’ (7/266): Ibn ‘Abd al-Hakam narrated from Maalik: Trimming the moustache does not mean shaving it. I think that the one who shaves his moustache should be disciplined. Ashhab ibn Maalik narrated: Shaving it is a bid’ah (innovation). Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when he was upset by something, he would twist his moustache. If it was shaved off, there would be nothing to twist. End quote. See al-Tamheed (21/62-68). Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’ (1/34-341): The guideline on trimming the moustache is that it should be trimmed so that the edge of the lip can be seen, but it should not be shaved off completely. This is our view. End quote. In Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj by al-Ramli (8/148), who is one of the Shaafa’i imams, it says: It is makrooh to shave the moustache. End quote. This opinion was also narrated from a number of the salaf. Al-Bayhaqi narrated in al-Sunan al-Kubra (1/151) with his isnaad that Shurahbeel ibn Muslim al-Khawlaani said: I saw five of the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) trimming their moustaches and letting their beards grow and dyeing them with saffron: Abu Umaamah al-Baahili, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Bisr, ‘Utbah ibn ‘Abd al-Sulami, al-Hajjaaj ibn ‘Aamir al-Thamaali and al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’di Yakrib al-Kindi. They used to trim their moustaches to the edge of the lip. They responded to the evidence quoted in favour of the first view in two ways: 1 – What is meant by trimming is trimming the edge of the hair which grows over the lip, not shaving off the hair completely, based on the evidence of the reports which mention trimming only. Abu’l-Waleed al-Baaji said in al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’ (7/266): Ibn al-Qaasim narrated from Maalik that the explanation of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about trimming the moustache is that it is to be trimmed enough to let the red part of the lips show and the edges of the mouth. end quote. Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (1/340): These reports – i.e. the reports which speak of trimming the moustache – are understood by us to mean trimming it to the edge of the lips, not shaving it off completely. End quote. 2 – Trimming does not mean removing it altogether, rather it means removing part of it. The more correct view – and Allaah knows best – is the second one, which is that the Sunnah is to trim the moustache and not to shave it. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (11/Baab al-Siwaak wa Sunan al-Fitrah/question no. 54): The best is to trim the moustache as is the Sunnah. As for shaving it, that is not Sunnah. The analogy drawn by some of them, that it is prescribed to shave it as the head is shaved in Hajj is an analogy when a clear text states something else, so this analogy does not carry any weight. Hence Maalik said concerning shaving the moustache: It is an innovation that has appeared among the people, but we should not turn away from what is mentioned in the Sunnah, because following it is guidance, righteousness, happiness and success. End quote. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: In a number of ahaadeeth it says “trim the moustache”. Is shaving different from trimming? Some people trim the first part of the moustache that is closest to the upper lip, and they leave the hair of the moustache, so they trim nearly half of the moustache and leave the rest. Is this what is meant? Or does trimming the moustache mean shaving off all of it? Please advise me of the manner in which the moustache should be trimmed. They replied: The saheeh ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicate that it is prescribed to trim the moustache. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the mushrikeen.” (Agreed upon). And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the Magians,” and in some versions it says: “Trim the moustache.” Trimming means cutting it very short. The one who cuts his moustache very short so that the upper lip is visible or trims it is not to blame, because the ahaadeeth mention two things, but it is not permissible to leave the edges of the moustache, rather the whole moustache should be trimmed or cut, in accordance with the Sunnah. End quote. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (5/149). Al-Tabari and al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad favoured the view that both are permissible: shaving and trimming; al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar also inclined towards this view in Fath al-Baari (10/347). See: al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (25/320). And Allaah knows best."
421,Are al-Sitteer and al-Sattaar names of Allaah?,"Question What is the difference between al-Sitteer and al-Sattaar? Which of them is one of the names of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted?.","Praise be to Allah.The names of Allaah are a tawqeefi matter [i.e., they can only be known through divine Revelation and sound texts of hadeeth, with no room for ijtihad], as is the view of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, so He is not to be called by anything except that by which He called Himself or that His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) called Him. Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The names of Allaah are tawqeefi and reason plays no role in knowing them. Based on that, we should limit our sources concerning them to what is narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and not add or subtract anything from that, because human reason cannot work out the names that He deserves. So we must limit ourselves to the divine texts and sound hadeeth with regard to that, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allaah)” [al-Isra’ 17:35] “Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al‑Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge’” [al-A’raaf 7:33] Because calling Him by a name which He has not called Himself by, or denying a name that He has called Himself by, is a transgression against His rights. It is essential to observe proper etiquette with regard to that and limit it to what is mentioned in the text. End quote. Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 3/275 Secondly: The name al-Sattaar is not proven -- as far as we know -- in the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah as one of the names of Allaah, may He be exalted. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez al-Raajihi (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: Is al-Sattaar one of the beautiful names of Allaah? He replied: I do not know of al-Sattaar being one of the names of Allaah, but one of the names of Allaah is al-Sitteer, as it says in the hadeeth: “Allaah is Hayiy (so Kind that He does not ignore the plea of the one who asks of Him), Sitteer (the One Who conceals (people’s faults and mistakes)).” But as for the name al-Sattaar, I do not know that it is one of the names of Allaah; rather it comes under the heading of description: it may be said of Allaah that He is sattaar, and description is broader than the names. End quote. Quoting from the tape Sharh al-Ibaanah al-Sughra li Ibn Battah. With regard to the name al-Sitteer, it was narrated by Abu Dawood (4012) that the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah is characterized by modesty and concealment, and He loves modesty and concealment. When one of you washes himself, let him conceal himself.” It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked in Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh: Are al-Muhyiy and al-Sitteer regarded as names of Allaah? He replied: al-Muhyi is not one of the names of Allaah; rather it refers to one of the actions of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “It is He Who gives life and causes death. And when He decides upon a thing He says to it only: ‘Be!’ ___ and it is” [Ghaafir 40:68] So muhyiy is the participle from the verb ahya (to give life), and it is one of His actions, not one of His names. With regard to the name al-Sitteer, it is mentioned in a hadeeth, but its authenticity needs to be examined. If it is saheeh, then it is one of the names of Allaah, because the view of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is that every name of Allaah that is proven to be saheeh from the Messenger of Allaah is proven, i.e., it is proven to be one of His names. End quote. As for the difference between al-Sitteer and al-Sattaar, both of them are indicative of extreme concealment, and Allaah covers a great deal for His slaves. And Allaah knows best."
422,He suffered a nosebleed whilst fasting,"Question What is the ruling if a fasting person suffers a nosebleed, because this happened to me?.","Praise be to Allah.If the matter is as you describe, then your fast is valid, because your nosebleed did not happen by your choice, so the fact that it happened does not mean that you broke your fast. The evidence for that is the fact that sharee’ah seeks to avoid making things difficult for people, such as the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [al-Baqarah 2:286] “Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty” [al-Maa'idah 5:6] And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions."
423,What should he do with a tenant who does not want to leave the house?,"Question We are a family whose breadwinner has died, and he left us some property. Some people have been living in this property for a long time, 18 years, for a rent of 40 Egyptian pounds. Allaah has blessed these tenants with wealth and made them so well-off that they own property themselves. One of them has put the property in his sons’ names, another has put it in his wife’s name. We are in great need of those apartments, so I went to them and asked them to vacate the apartments, and I explained the situation to them, but all I got from them was a refusal to budge. One of them asked for a huge amount of money in return for leaving. I tried to talk to them several times but without success. The law in our country is on their side. After that I asked them for more rent so that we can meet our own living expenses, but that also met with no success. What should I do?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The reason why such problems arise between landlord and tenant is the failure to adhere to the laws of Allaah when drawing up signing the lease. One of the things in which many people go against sharee’ah, causing them a lot of problems, is not defining the period of rental, because defining the period of rental prevents disputes and protects the rights of both sides; it obliges the landlord to let the tenant stay in the property and it obliges the tenant to pay the rent to the landlord for the duration of the rental period, and it obliges him to adhere to the terms of the lease and pay the rent even if he does not use the property. Ibn Qudaamah said: There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that it is permissible to rent out property. Ibn al-Mundhir said: All the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that renting out houses and animals is permissible. And it is only permissible to rent them out for a specific, defined period, after viewing and defining the property in question, because it cannot be known otherwise. It is not permissible not to define the timescale or describe the property. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. Al-Mughni, 5/260. The correct view is that the rental period does not have to be limited to a specific length of time, rather it can continue for months or decades, so long as that is with the agreement of both parties. Ibn Qudaamah said: If the rental is to last for a period it should be known, such as a month or a year. There is no dispute concerning that as far as we know. Because the timescale is important with regard to the property to be rented, so it must be known, just as when selling a commodity that can be measured, it should be sold by measure. Al-Mughni, 5/251. And he said: The maximum period of renting cannot be defined, rather the property that is rented may continue to be rented so long as it is still sound, even if the period is lengthy. This is the view of all the scholars… because Allaah tells us that Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) said: “on condition that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten years, it will be (a favour) from you” [al-Qasas 28:27] The law of the nations before us is our law too, unless there is evidence that it has been abrogated. al-Mughni, 5/253 Secondly: With regard to the death of either the tenant or the landlord before the expiry of the rental period, the majority of scholars are of the view that the contract is not annulled by the death of either party. The Hanafis and some of the Taabi’een held a different view and said that the contract is annulled, unless the heirs of the landlord agree to that, and that they have the right to demand that the rental property be vacated. The correct view is the view of the majority, so the contract remains binding on both parties for the duration of the rental period. In the book al-Ijaarah, al-Bukhaari is quoted as having a chapter in his Saheeh entitled “Chapter: If a person rents land and one of them dies. Ibn Seereen said: The family do not have the right to make him leave until the period (of the rental agreement) is ended. Al-Hakam, al-Hasan and Iyaas ibn Mu’aawiyah said: The rental continues until the end of the period agreed upon. Ibn ‘Umar said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave Khaybar to its people in return for half of the harvest. That was at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, and the beginning of Umar’s caliphate, and there is no mention that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar renewed the rental contract after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died. End quote. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: The words “Chapter: If a person rents land and one of them dies” mean: is the rental annulled or not? The majority view is that it is not annulled. The Kufis and al-Layth were of the view that it is annulled… they agreed that the rental is not annulled if the person in charge of the waqf dies, and this is the case here. The words “The family do not have the right to…” refer to the family of the deceased. “to make him leave” means, to make the tenant leave. The point here is to prove that the rental agreement is not annulled if one of the two parties dies. This is the apparent meaning and is referred to by the words “and there is no mention that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar renewed the rental contract after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died”. Fath al-Baari, 4/463. Thirdly: With regard to what you should do about the tenants who refuse to leave, we advise the following: 1 – You should explain to them that the contract between you and them is not acceptable according to sharee’ah because it does not mention the time period for the contract. We have stated above that the time period must be stated, and there is no dispute among the scholars on this point. 2 – You should give them sufficient opportunity to vacate the property, and this period should be stated clearly to correct the previous mistake and there should be a new contract with a set time period. 3 – If they refuse to leave, then you should tell them that they are usurping the property and are sinning, and you should tell them of the punishment for wrongdoing and the ruling on those who usurp property. 4 – You should bring in some influential wise men who could speak to them, or some of their relatives or acquaintances whom they will listen to. You can agree to pay them some money to leave the apartment. It is haraam for them to consume this money, but as far as you are concerned, if the person who is wronged cannot get his rights except by giving money to the wrongdoer, it is permissible for him to do that. See question no. 40272. 5 – If that does not work either, then you have three choices: You can pray against them – for the prayer of the oppressed is answered; or you can let them off; or you can leave their case to Allaah to take your rights from them for you. And Allaah knows best."
424,Removal of women's body hair,"Question What is the ruling concerning the removal of women's body hair? If it is permitted, who is permitted to do that for her?","Praise be to Allah. It is permitted for a woman to remove all her body hair, except for her eyebrows and the hair on her head, which she is not permitted to shave or remove by other methods. She may remove other hair herself, or her husband or other mahram may remove it within the limits of what he is permitted to see, or another woman may do this, within the limits of what she is permitted to see."
425,"A young man did all kinds of haraam actions, and he wants to repent","Question I am a young man who is an evildoer (faasiq) and a kaafir. I want to repent to Allaah. I used to do all kinds of haraam actions, and I do not pray. But now I want to repent. I hope the Shaykh can tell me how to repent.","Praise be to Allah. “Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islam) before the torment comes upon you, (and) then you will not be helped. And follow the best of that which is sent down to you from your Lord (i.e. this Qur’aan, do what it orders you to do and keep away from what it forbids), before the torment comes on you suddenly while you perceive not!’” [al-Zumar 39:53-54 – interpretation of the meaning] I have received your letter and I was impressed with your eagerness to repent and come back to Allaah, despite the fact that you have committed all kinds of haraam actions, as you say, above all neglecting prayer. It is very important that you should know that the gate of repentance is open to you. You should think deeply about what is mentioned in the aayahs quoted above. I will also tell you some practical steps which will show you clearly how to repent, in sha Allah. The word tawbah (repentance) is a great word with deep meaning. It is not, as many people think, merely words to be uttered whilst persisting in sin. Think about what Allaah says: “Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance” [Hood 11:3 – interpretation of the meaning] You will see that repentance is something more than seeking forgiveness. Because this is a serious matter, there have to be conditions attached. The scholars mentioned the conditions of repentance, based on aayahs from the Qur’aan and ahaadeeth. There follows a list of some of them: 1 – Giving up the sin immediately. 2 – Regretting what has happened in the past. 3 – Resolving not to go back to it. 4 – Making amends to those whom you have wronged, or asking for their forgiveness. You should not forget other important matters connected to sincere repentance, such as: 1 – You should give up the sin for the sake of Allaah and not for any other reason such as not being able to do it or repeat it, or being afraid of what people will say, for example. The person who gives up a sin because it may affect his standing or reputation among people, or because it may cost him his job, cannot be described as having repented. The person who gives up sins for the sake of his health and strength cannot be described as having repented, such as a person who gives up zinaa (adultery) and immoral actions for fear of contagious deadly diseases, or for fear that they may weaken his body and his memory. The person who refrains from taking a bribe for fear that it may be being offered by undercover officers cannot be described as having repented. The person who gives up drinking alcohol and taking drugs because he has become bankrupt cannot be described as having repented. Similarly, the person who is unable to commit sin because of something that lies beyond his control cannot be described as having repented, such as a liar who becomes paralyzed and loses the power of speech, or an adulterer who loses the ability to engage in intercourse, or a thief who has an accident and loses his limbs. In such cases, a person has to feel regret and stop wishing to commit sin, or he has to feel sorry for what has happened in the past. To someone like this the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Regret is repentance.” (narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Maajah; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6802) 2 – He should feel repelled by the sin and the harm it causes. This means that sincere repentance cannot be accompanied by feelings of enjoyment and pleasure when remembering past sins, or wishing to go back to it in the future. In his book al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawaa’ wa’l-Fawaa’id, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned many of the harmful effects of sin, including the following: Being deprived of (Islamic) knowledge – feelings of alienation in the heart – difficulties – physical weakness – being unable to do acts of worship – being deprived of blessings – less help from Allaah – anxiety – more bad deeds – getting used to sin – the sinner becomes insignificant in the sight of Allaah – he becomes insignificant in the sight of people – the curse of the animals will be upon him – he will bear marks of humiliation – his heart will be sealed and he will come under the curse (of Allaah) – his du’aa’ will not be answered – cause of mischief on land and sea – loss of gheerah (protective jealousy) – loss of modesty – the blessings of Allaah will disappear – punishment will befall him – terror in the heart of the sinner – falling into the clutches of the Shaytaan – a bad end – punishment in the Hereafter. Knowing these harmful effects of sin will make you want to keep away from sin altogether, but some people may move from one sin to another for a number of reasons, including the following: - They think that it is less serious - The self is more inclined towards it and the desire for it is stronger - It is easier to commit this sin than others, unlike sins which require some preparation; the means of doing it are readily available and widespread - His friends and companions are committing this sin and it is difficult for him to differ from them - A particular sin may give a person some status among his companions, and it is too difficult for him to lose this position, so he continues to commit that sin. 3 – He should hasten to repent. Hence delaying repentance is in and of itself a sin for which repentance is required. 4 – You should make up the duties towards Allaah that you have missed, if that is possible, such as paying the zakaah which you withheld in the past; and because this is something which is the right of the poor. 5 – You should keep away from places of sin if your being there may make you fall into sin again. 6 – You should keep away from those who helped you to commit sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-Zukhruf 43:67] Bad friends will curse one another on the Day of Resurrection, so you should keep away from them and break off your friendship with them, and warn others against them if you are not able to call them (to Allaah). Do nt let the Shaytaan deceive you or make the idea of going back to them in order to call them to Allaah look attractive to you, for you know that you are weak and will not be able to resist. There are many cases in which people have gone back to sin because they resumed relationships with their former companions. 7 – Destroy haraam things that you may have in your possession, such as intoxicants, musical instruments, haraam pictures and movies, permissive stories, statues and so on. They should be broken, destroyed or burnt. It is very essential that the one who wants to repent should rid himself of all items of jaahiliyyah. How often has it happened that keeping these haraam things caused people who had repented to go back on their repentance and be led astray after having been guided. We ask Allaah to make us steadfast. 8 – Choose righteous friends who will help you against your nafs (self) and who will be an alternative to bad company. Strive to attend circles of dhikr and gatherings of knowledge. Fill your time with beneficial things so that the Shaytaan will not find any opportunity to remind you of the past. 9 – Focus on your body which has been fed on haraam substances and direct its energies towards obeying Allaah. Seek out halaal substances with which to nourish your body so that your flesh will be renewed with halaal substances. 10 – Do a lot of good deeds, for good deeds cancel out bad deeds. If you are sincere in your repentance to Allaah, then receive the good news that all your previous evil deeds will be changed into good deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Furqaan 25:68] I ask Allaah to benefit you by these words, and to guide your heart. Now get up and utter the Shahaadatyan, purify yourself (with ghusl) and pray as Allaah has commanded you. Observe the Islamic duties regularly and give up haraam things. I will be happy to help you in any way. I ask Allaah to give us and you strength to do that which He loves and is pleased with. May He accept the repentance of us all, for He is the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful."
426,Ruling on praying in a room in which there are images,"Question Why is it not permissable for a Muslim to make Salat in a room the has symbols of Idolatry on the walls(Christmas wreaths, etc)?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not allowed to pray in a place in which there are images of animate beings. In fact some of them were of the view that doing so is haraam, although the view of the majority is that it is makrooh. Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for fabric on which there are images or crossed lines or anything that distracts the worshipper, it is makrooh to pray in it, facing towards it or on it. End quote from al-Majmoo‘, 3/185 Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Tayimiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The correct view, which was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and others, and is mentioned in reports from Ahmad and others, is that if there are images in it (the church), he should not pray there, because the angels do not enter the room in which there are images, and because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not enter the Ka‘bah until the images that were in it had been erased. This is what ‘Umar said: We would not enter their churches if there were images in them. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 22/162 Al-Bahooti al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is makrooh to pray facing towards a set-up image, as was stated, because it is similar to the kuffaar’s prostrating to them (images). … In al-Fusool it says: It is makrooh to pray facing a wall on which there are pictures and images, because that is similar to the worship of idols and statues. End quote from Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘, 1/370 The scholars of the Standing Committee said: Praying in a place in which there is an image in front of the ones who are praying is resembling the worshippers of idols, and there are many hadeeths which indicate that it is forbidden to resemble the enemies of Allah and that we are enjoined to differ from them. It should also be noted that putting pictures of animate beings on walls is something that is not permissible; rather it is something that leads to exaggeration and shirk, especially if they are images of people who are venerated. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/250-251. ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ghadyaan, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Qa‘ood The later Hanafi and Shaafa‘i scholars – unlike the Hanbalis – were so strict that they even forbade praying in a place in which there are any images, even if they are behind the one who is praying or placed on the ground so that he cannot see them. Al-Shibramalsi al-Shaafa‘i said: It is makrooh to pray in a garment on which there is an image, or on a cloth on which there is an image, even if one is blind or it is dark, or the image is behind his back or placed face downwards on the ground so that he cannot see it when he prays on it (the cloth). This is clear, so as to keep away from the image which is forbidden. End quote from Haashiyat Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 2/14 Secondly: From the comments quoted above we may find out and understand the wisdom behind not allowing prayer in a place in which there are images and statues. These reasons are: -1- The angels do not enter a room where there is an image. It was narrated from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a room in which there is a dog or an image.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3225; Muslim, 2106. The worshipper is asking Allah to send down mercy and increase blessings; how could you ask for that in a place where the angels of mercy will not enter? -2- Avoiding any resemblance to those who worship idols and statues, namely the idolaters, or even the Christians, who fill their churches with images of Christ and his mother Mary (peace be upon them) on the basis of falsehood. Avoiding any imitations of the non-Muslims is one of the important teachings of sharee‘ah, so as to prevent the identity of the Muslims from being assimilated and lost, and so as to preserve its bright light which shines forth among the nations. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that Umm Habeebah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church that they had seen in Abyssinia in which there were images, to the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Those people, if there was a righteous man among them and he died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They will be the most evil of mankind before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 427; Muslim, 528 -3- Avoiding that which may distract the worshipper. If an image is in front of one who is praying, it may distract him and cause his mind to wander, when the Muslim should seek to attain the highest degree of focus and humility when standing before Allah, may He be exalted, in his prayer. It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘Aa’ishah had a patterned curtain with which she covered the side of her house. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Take this patterned curtain of yours away from us because its images kept distracting me in my prayer.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 374, in Bab Kiraahiyyat al-salaah fil tasaaweer. See also the answer to question number 161211 . And Allah knows best."
427,"Reflections upon the hadith of the cistern, and the groups whom the angels will push away from it","Question What is the meaning of the hadith qudsi which says that when the Muslims come to the cistern of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) [on the Day of Resurrection], Allah will turn away a group of people, and the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will say: “O Lord, my ummah, my ummah!”, and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: “You do not know what they did after you were gone”?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The hadith scholars call this hadith “the hadith of the cistern (hadith al-hawd)”. There are several versions and narrations of the hadith, with no difference between them, by the grace of Allah. There follow some of the versions of the reports: It was narrated that Sahl ibn Sa‘d said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I will reach the Cistern ahead of you. He who comes to me will drink, and whoever drinks will never thirst again. There will come to me some people whom I will recognize and they will recognize me, then they will be prevented from reaching me. I shall say: ‘They are of me,’ but it will be said: ‘You do not know what they introduced after you were gone.’ So I shall say: ‘Away, away with those who changed (the religion) after I was gone.’” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6212) and Muslim (2290). It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to the graveyard and said: “Peace be upon the abode of believing people, and if Allah wills we will join you soon. Would that we could see our brothers.” They said: Are we not your brothers, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “You are my companions. Our brothers are those who have not come yet.” They said: How will you recognize those of your ummah who have not come yet, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Do you not see that if a man has a horses that have white blazes and white feet among horses that are all black, will he not recognize his horses?” They said: Of course, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “They will come to me with bright faces and limbs (like the white markings of a horse) because of the traces of wudoo’. I will reach the Cistern before them, and men will be driven away from my Cistern as stray camels are driven away. I will call out to them, ‘Come here!’ but it will be said, ‘They changed after you were gone.’ And I will say, ‘Away with you, away with you!’” Narrated by Muslim (249). It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “I will be at the cistern, waiting for those of you who will come to me. Some men will be prevented from reaching me, so I will say: ‘O Lord, my ummah, my ummah!’ but it will be said to me: ‘You do not know what they did after you were gone; they kept turning on their heels.’” Narrated by Ahmad (41/388); classed as saheeh by the commentators. It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Some of those who accompanied me will come to me at the Cistern, and when I see them and they come close to me, they will be snatched away before they reach me. I will say: ‘O Lord, my companions [usayhaabi], my companions!’ but it will be said to me: You do not know what they introduced after you were gone.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6211) and Muslim (2304). It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I will reach the Cistern ahead of you, and some of you will come close to me until, when I am about to reach out (to give them a drink), they will be snatched away before they reach me. I will say: ‘O Lord, my companions!’ He will say: ‘You do not know what they introduced after you were gone.’” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6642) and Muslim (2297). Secondly: When reflecting upon the hadiths quoted above, we find that the words refer only to groups of people who will head towards the cistern of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to drink from it, but the angels will push them back. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will call out to them, saying words such as “my ummah” or “my companions (ashaabi or usayhaabi). This variation in wording is not contradictory; rather it is to be understood as referring to people who are referred to by these words, and we can sum up these people [who will be pushed away from the cistern] as follows: 1. Those who apostatised from Islam after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and had become Muslim during his lifetime and had seen him when they were Muslims. 2. Those who apostatised from Islam at the end of the Prophet’s life, but he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was not aware of their disbelief. 3. Hypocrites who outwardly appeared to be Muslims, but concealed disbelief in our hearts. 4. Followers of whims and desires who changed the Sunnah and teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), such as the Raafidis and Khawaarij. 5. Some of these scholars include among these people those who committed major sins. There is evidence from the Sunnah to support this view. Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad (9/514) that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There will be rulers over you who will tell you to do what they do not do themselves. Whoever believes in and confirms their lies, and helps them in their wrongdoing, is not of me and I am not of him, and he will never come to me at the cistern.” Classed as saheeh by the commentators on al-Musnad. The phrase “my ummah (ummati)” in the hadiths is applicable to nos. 4 and 5 above. The phrase “my companions (as-haabi or usayhaabi)” is applicable to the first three groups. What indicates that they are part of his ummah is the fact that he will recognise them by the traces of wudoo’ on their faces and limbs, which is a mark that is unique to this ummah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will recognise them by their general attributes, not individually, because they came after he was gone. What indicates that the hypocrites are included in the phrase “my companions (as-haabi)” is the fact that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said [when some of the Sahaabah suggested killing the hypocrites, and he refused to do so]: “Lest people say that he is killing his companions (as-haabahu).” Narrated by al-Bukhari (3518). This is the purely linguistic sense of companionship; it does not mean that they deserve the honour of being called companions of the Prophet, because the definition of the technical term Sahaabi [companion of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] is not applicable to these people. There follow some scholarly comments on these hadiths: 1. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadith: This is something concerning which the scholars differed as to what is meant. There are several views, as follows: i. That it refers to the hypocrites and apostates. They may be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection) with the traces of wudoo’ on their faces and limbs, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will call out to them because of the mark that is on them, but it will be said: These people are not among those concerning whom the promise was given to you, for they changed after you were gone, i.e., they did not die as Muslims although they appeared to be Muslims. ii. That it refers to those who were Muslims at the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then they apostatised after he was gone, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) will call them, even if there is no trace of wudoo’ on them, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) knew them as Muslims during his lifetime. But it will be said: They apostatised after you were gone. iii. That it refers to people who committed sins, including major sins, but died believing in Tawheed, and followers of innovation (bid‘ah) whose innovation did not put them beyond the pale of Islam. Sharh Muslim (3/136, 137). 2. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Al-Khattaabi said: None of the Sahaabah apostatised; rather those who apostatised were some of the rough, hardhearted Arabs, who were not known for making any effort in supporting the religion. Their apostasy does not undermine the status of the well-known Sahaabah. The phrase “my companions [usayhaabi, which is a diminutive form of the word]” indicates that they are few in number. Fath al-Bari (11/385). 3. Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that those who apostatised after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) from the tribes of Kindah, Haneefah, Fazaarah, Banu Asad and Banu Bakr ibn Waa’il were not among the Ansaar or the Muhaajireen who migrated before the conquest of Makkah; rather the religious texts give the title of Muhaajireen to those who migrated to join the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before the conquest of Makkah. They – praise be to Allah – remained steadfast in adhering to the true religion and the straight path. Ahl as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that those who were present with the Messenger of Allah (sa) at Badr will be among the people of Paradise; the same is true of those who were present with him at Bay‘at ar-Radwaan in al-Hudaybiyah. Al-Farq bayna al-Firaq (p. 353). 4. Ash-Shaatibi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What appears to be the case is that they will be included in the midst of this ummah, because of the signs that they will have on them [on the Day of Resurrection], namely the traces of wudoo’ on their faces and limbs, because that sign cannot be present on people who are complete disbelievers, whether they were originally disbelievers (and remained so) or apostates (from Islam), and because of the words “they changed after you were gone.” If that referred to disbelief, he would have said, “they disbelieved after you were gone.” The more likely interpretation is that what is meant is drifting away from the Sunnah, which is applicable to the followers of innovation. With regard to those who suggested that it refers to hypocrisy, that falls within the parameters of what we are saying, because the hypocrites did religious duties by way of dissimulation, not by way of worship, so they fulfilled religious obligations in a manner that was not proper, which is exactly what innovation is. This is applicable to anyone who follows the Sunnah and puts it into practice by as a means of accumulating worldly gains – and not as a means of worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, and drawing closer to Him – because that is toying with the Sunnah and practising it in a manner that is contrary to Islamic teachings. Al-I‘tisaam (1/96). 5. Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our scholars (may Allah have mercy on them all) said: Everyone who apostatised from the religion of Allah, or introduced into it something with which Allah is not please and for which He did not give permission, will be among those who will be pushed away and kept away from the cistern. Those who will be most harshly pushed away are those who differed from the main body (jamaa‘ah) of the Muslims and drifted away from their path, such as the Khawaarij and Raafidis of various groups, and the Mu ‘tazilah who followed different whims and desires. All of these people introduced changes. The same applies to the wrongdoers who went to extremes in committing injustice and oppression, and tried to suppress the truth, killing and humiliating the people of truth, as well as those who committed major sins openly, taking the matter of sin lightly, and groups who drifted away and followed their whims and desires and innovations. Moreover, they may be pushed away for a while, then allowed to come closer after being forgiven, if the problem had to do with misdeeds and not matters of belief (‘aqeedah). Based on this assumption, this group will be known by the light of wudoo’, then it will be said, “Away with them.” But if they were among the hypocrites who lived at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who made an outward display of faith whilst inwardly disbelieving, they will be taken as they appear to be, then their real nature will be exposed, and it will be said, “Away, away with them.” No one will abide forever in hell except a disbeliever, a denier and a follower of falsehood in whose heart there was not even a mustard seed’s weight of faith. At-Tadhkirah fi Ahwaal al-Mawtaa wa’d-Daar al-Aakhirah (p. 352). Thirdly: What proves that the Raafidis are lying in their claim that the major Sahaabah Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan were among the apostates is the fact that it is proven, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that apostasy occurred and the apostates were fought, so who fought whom? Those who apostatised are those whose description we have mentioned, namely some of the Arab tribes, and the one who fought them was Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) and his brethren among the Muhaajireen and Ansaar – and ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) also took part with them in fighting the apostates; he took one of the captured women of Banu Haneefah as a concubine, and she bore him a son who later became a prominent scholar, namely Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. If the noble Sahaabah Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and the Muhaajireen and Ansaar who were with them, were apostates, then what would be the case with regard to Musaylimah and al-‘Ansi, and their followers? No doubt this view (of the Raafidis) is the very essence of hypocrisy and troublemaking; it is a lie and false witness. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: May Allah punish these apostates and liars, the followers of the apostates, who are striving to oppose Allah, His Messenger, His Book and His religion; they exited Islam and threw it behind their backs, and they strove against Allah and His Messenger and His believing slaves, taking as allies the apostates and dissenters. This talk and other things they say, confirm that these people, who bear such resentment towards Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) and other Sahaabah, are the same as the disbelieving apostates, like those apostates whom Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) fought. Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (4/490). And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: To sum up, the story of Musaylimah the Liar, and his claim of prophethood, and Banu Haneefah in al-Yamaamah following him, and Abu Bakr fighting them for that, is something that is well-known and narrated via mutawaatir reports; it is known to everyone, elite and common folk alike, like any other well-known incident that was narrated via mutawaatir reports. This story is not something that is known to the elite only; rather it is more widely known among the people than the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffeen. It was narrated from one of the scholars of kalaam that he denied that the battles of the Camel and Siffeen took place, even though this denial was unfounded; yet we do not know of anyone who denied that the Muslims fought the people of al-Yamaamah and that Musaylimah the Liar claimed to be a prophet, and the Muslims fought him because of that. As for these Raafidis, their denial [that Abu Bakr fought the apostates] is akin to their denial that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were buried alongside the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and their denial that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were allies of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and among his inner circle, and they claim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed ‘Ali as his successor, mentioning him by name. In fact some of them even denied that Zaynab, Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthoom were the daughters of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)! They said that they were daughters of Khadeejah from her first husband, who was a disbeliever, to whom she was married before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (4/492, 493). And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They – namely the Raafidis – claim that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and those who followed them, apostatised from Islam! But the elite and the common folk know that Abu Bakr was the one who fought the apostates. If they claim that the people of al-Yamaamah were wronged and killed unlawfully, and they disapprove of fighting them and try to find excuses for them, then this proves that these people [Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah] are following in the footsteps of those earlier generations [the Sahaabah], and that Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq and his followers fight the apostates in every era. The claim of Ibn al-Mutahhar al-Hilli ar-Raafidi, that they regarded the tribe of Banu Haneefah as apostates because they refused to pay zakaah to Abu Bakr, is one of the most blatant and egregious lies, because Abu Bakr only fought Banu Haneefah due to their belief in Musaylimah the Liar and his claim to be a prophet. As for those who withheld zakaah, they were people other than Banu Haneefah. Concerning those people, some of the Sahaabah were not certain about the permissibility of fighting them, but none of them ever had any doubt about the obligation to fight Banu Haneefah… Minhaaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (4/493, 494). Fourthly: It may be said to these Raafidis: Why did the first three caliphs apostatise and not ‘Ali? Why is it that people such as ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir, al-Miqdaad ibn al-Aswad, Abu Dharr and Salmaan al-Faarisi were exempted from apostasy? Or is this simply nothing but whims and desires?! We believe that the Muhaajireen and Ansaar will be in Paradise forever. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.” [at-Tawbah 9:100]. We believe that Abu Bakr is in Paradise, ‘Umar is in Paradise, ‘Uthmaan is in Paradise and ‘Ali is in Paradise, and this applies to all of those whom the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned by name; all of them will drink from the cistern of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and will enjoy that drink. Woe and doom to those who curse them and regard them as disbelievers, when they themselves are more deserving to be, on the Day of Resurrection, among the apostates whom these noble ones fought. Fifthly: These hadiths offer proof against the Raafidis, as they reiterate that the Sahaabah, with few exceptions, apostatised, and they claim that they introduced changes after the death of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). What this means is that they were believers before that! So what religion did they believe in after that? What did they do to deserve this denunciation and accusation of disbelief?! If you (Raafidis) say that they took the caliphate away from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with), that may be described as a sin, but if it is a sin, as you claim, then their good deeds could outweigh it. It is sufficient for the Sahaabah that you revile and curse them, so that all their (alleged) sins will be transferred to you, in sha Allah. If they (Raafidis) refer to the alleged killing of the unborn child of Faatimah, we say: thousands of people were killed at the time of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him); will you apply the same rule and regard him as a disbeliever too? From the above, it is clear that the noble Sahaabah are the ones who defended the religion of Allah, and they are the ones who stopped the spread of apostasy, which was supported and promoted by the forerunners of the Raafidis, such as Musaylimah the Liar and al-Aswad al-‘Ansi. In His holy Book, Allah, may He be exalted, praised the Muhaajireen and Ansaar, in Qur’an that will be recited until the onset of the Hour. Their Lord has declared them to be above falling into innovation, so how could they have fallen into apostasy, when they are the ones who spread Islam far and wide? And Allah knows best."
428,His father will not let him observe i’tikaaf for reasons that are not convincing,Question What is the ruling on one whose father will not let him observe i'tikaaf for reasons that are not convincing?.,"Praise be to Allah.I’tikaaf is Sunnah and honouring one's parents is obligatory, and an obligatory duty cannot be waived for something that is Sunnah; the Sunnah cannot be regarded as equal to something that is obligatory, because the obligatory duty takes precedence over it. Allaah says in a hadeeth qudsi: “My slave does not draw close to me by means of anything that is dearer to Me than that which I have made obligatory upon him.” If your father tells you not to observe i’tikaaf and he says things that imply that you should not observe i'tikaaf because he needs you, then the way he sees things is correct, not the way you see things. Because you want to do i’tikaaf, so you think that these reasons are not acceptable, but your father thinks that they are acceptable. What we advise you is not to do i’tikaaf. Yes, if your father says to you not to do i'tikaaf and he does not mention any reason for that, you do not have to obey him in that case, because you are not obliged to obey him in something that will not harm him if you go against him, and when there is a benefit for you in that thing.

429,Warning and comment on the Peking Women’s Conference,Question What is the view of the Muslim scholars on the recommendations of the Peking Women's Conference? What is the ruling on getting rid of all forms of discrimination against women?,"Praise be to Allah.The fourth international conference on women has been announced in the media, to be held from 9-20/4/1416 (4/10/1995) in Peking, the capital of China. I have read a agenda prepared for this conference which includes 362 items in 177 pages, and the statements published by a number of scholars in the Muslim world stating the danger posed by this conference and the evil consequences it will bring to humanity in general and the Muslims in particular. It became clear to us, from the agenda mentioned above, that this conference is a follow-up to the conference on population and development which was held in Cairo in Rabee’ al-Thaani 1415 AH, concerning which statements were issued by the Council of Senior Scholars and the Founding Committee of the Muslim World League, both of which were headed by myself. The two statements both condemned the conference mentioned, because it went against the religion of Islam and opposed Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and because it promoted promiscuity and the violation of sanctities, and aimed to turn human societies into herds of animals, so the conference should be boycotted… etc. Now comes this conference which is along the same lines as the Cairo conference, focusing on the equality of men and women in all areas. The proposals of the document referred to above have been adopted by the General Secretariat of the United Nations on the basis of principles of kufr and misguided means of achieving that, including the following: Calling for the abolition of any law that distinguishes between men and women on the grounds of religion; calling for promiscuity in the name of “practising safe sex”; encouraging single-parent families; educating the youth, boys and girls, about sexual matters; fighting discrimination between men and women; calling upon young men and women to destroy the differences between the two sexes that are based on religion; telling them that religion is an obstacle to equality… and other obvious examples of kufr and misguidance that are mentioned in the document. This plot is against Islam and the Muslims, and indeed against humanity as a whole, to rid it of chastity, modesty and honour. Hence it is obligatory for the Muslim authorities and all those to whom Allaah has given power over the Muslims’ affairs, to boycott this conference and to take the necessary measures of preventing its evils from reaching the Muslims. They must present a united front against this immoral assault. The Muslims must take precautions against the plots of the plotters and the hatred of those who hate. We ask Allaah to foil the plots of our enemies and turn them against them. We ask them to bring these efforts of theirs to naught, and to give the Muslims and their leaders the strength to do what is in their best interests. May He reform them, men and woman alike, and grant them happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter, for He is the One Who is Able to do that. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."
430,Can You Observe Fasting With Braces On?,"Question Do I have to take out my removable braces when fasting? Because when I speak with them in my mouth, it creates a lot of saliva and I cannot help swallowing it. Please advise me, may Allah reward you with all good.","Praise be to Allah.You do not have to take out your braces in order to fast, because nothing goes from it to the stomach. The fact that it causes you to produce more saliva does not mean that it breaks the fast. The scholars stated that it is permissible for a person who is fasting to put a dirham (a coin) in his mouth whilst fasting, and it is more appropriate that it be permissible to put braces in one's mouth than a coin, because people do not put braces in their mouth unless they need to. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Whoever puts a dirham or a dinar in his mouth whilst he is fasting, so long as the taste of it does not reach his throat, there is nothing wrong with that, but if he notices a taste, then I do not approve of that.” (Al-Mughni, 4/359) And if he swallows the saliva , even if it is a lot, that does not affect his fast. For more, please see these answers: 1312 , 13619 , 12487 , and 82308 . And Allah knows best."
431,The people of Paradise will remember the life of this world,"Question In Paradise will the servants of Allah remember the Previous world, and therefore, be able to desire Things that they desired on earth?","Praise be to Allah. There is evidence in the Qur’aan that the people of Paradise will remember the life of this world. For example, in Soorat al-Toor, Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: ‘Aforetime, we were afraid with our families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful."" [al-Toor 52:25-28] They will also remember the evil people who tried to make the people of faith have doubts and called them to kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning. A speaker of them will say, ‘Verily, I had a companion (in the world), who used to say, ""Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death), (that) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?"" [al-Saffaat 37:50-53] They will remember the trials and tribulations they went though in this world, with regard to themselves, their children, their families and their wealth, and they will say joyfully: ""… ‘All praise and thanks be to Allaah, Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds and to recompense).’"" [Faatir 35:34] They will also be reminded of this life when they see the fruits which will resemble those which they used to eat in this world, but whose size and taste are different. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""… Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: ‘This is what we were provided with before,’ and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e., in the same form but different in taste)…"" [al-Baqarah 2:25] They will also recall their du’aa’s in times of hardship, when they raised their hands to heaven asking for their deeds to be accepted and for help to do righteous deeds and to be included among those who would inherit blessings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: ‘Aforetime, we were afraid with out families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful."" [al-Toor 52:25-28] As regards the matter of them desiring something like the blessings of this world, they will in fact desire something better than that, because even the person who is the lowest in status in Paradise will enjoy something like ten times the joys of this world. ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘I know who will be the last person to be brought out of Hell and the last person to enter Paradise. It will be a man who will come out of Hell crawling. Allaah will say to him, ""Go and enter Paradise."" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, ""O Lord, I found it full."" Allaah will say to him a second time, ""Go and enter Paradise."" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, ""O Lord, I found it full."" Allaah will say to him, ""Go and enter Paradise, for there you will have something like the world and ten times more."" The man will say, ""Are You making fun of me (or are You laughing at me), and You are the King of all?""’ - and I saw the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiling so broadly that his back teeth could be seen. He used to say, ‘That is the person who is lowest in status in Paradise.’"" [Agreed upon; this version is reported by Muslim, no. 272] Everything that the people of Paradise desire will be theirs, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""… (there will be) therein all that one’s inner-self could desire, all that the eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein forever."" [al-Zukhruf 43:71] A number of ahaadeeth state that the people of Paradise will have their desires for children or to grow things fulfilled, without having to wait for them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was speaking about the people of Paradise one day when a Bedouin was present. He described how a man of the people of Paradise will ask his Lord’s permission to grow some plants. (In Arabic, the past tense is used here to show that this will undoubtedly happen). Allaah will ask him, ""Do you not already have all that you want?"" He will say, ""Yes, but I like to grow things."" So he will go and plant his seeds, and within the blinking of an eye they will grow, ripen, be harvested and piled up like mountains. Allaah will say, ""Here you are, O son of Adam, nothing makes you satisfied!"" The Bedouin said, ""O Messenger of Allaah, you will find that he is either from Quraysh or the Ansaar, for they are the ones who like to grow things; we don’t like to grow anything!"" The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiled broadly. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6965). Ibn Hijr reported the following hadeeth in Fath al-Baari; from it we learn that whatever worldly desires one wishes for in Paradise can be fulfilled. Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ""If the believer in Paradise wishes for a child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in an instant."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2487. Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6649) We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy. And Allaah knows best."
432,Is a woman who puts her hair on the side included among those mentioned in the hadeeth about “maa’ilaat mumeelaat”,Question Is what is meant by the women who are maa’ilaat in the hadeeth gathering the hair and putting it to one side?.,"Praise be to Allah. Imam Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen, men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, maa’ilaat mumeelaat walking with an enticing gait (or turning away from righteousness and leading others astray) with their heads like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor smell its fragrance.” With regard to the phrase maa’ilaat mumeelaat, there are four opinions among the scholars: 1 – That they turn away (maa’ilaat) from chastity and righteousness, i.e., they commit sins and wrong deeds, like those who do immoral actions or fall short in performing obligatory duties such as prayers etc. And mumeelaat means that they lead others astray and call them to evil and corruption. So by their actions and words they lead others to corruption and sin and they commit immoral actions because of their lack of faith or weakness of faith. 2 – That maa’ilaat refers to their enticing walk and mumeelaat refers to the movement of their shoulders. 3 – That they incline towards men and lead them astray with what they show of their beauty and adornments etc. 4 – That they style their hair in the manner of prostitutes and style other women’s hair in the same manner. See Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 14/110 With regard to styling the hair, this means parting the hair in such a manner that there is more hair on one side than on the other. This was the sign of a prostitute during the Jaahiliyyah. Some of the scholars are of the view that the hairstyle of the prostitute is what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) “maa’ilaat mumeelaat”, but Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: The correct view is that what is meant by al-maa’ilaat is those who turn away from what is enjoined upon them of modesty and religious commitment, and al-mumeelaat means those who turn others away from that. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: maa’ilah in a general sense refers to anyone who turns away from the Straight Path, in her clothing, appearance, speech etc. And mumeelaat refers to those who turn others away, by using things which cause temptation, until people turn towards them. With regard to gathering the hair together and putting it on one side, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: The Sunnah is to part the hair in the middle, from the forelock at the front of the head up to the top of the head, because the hair has directions to the front and the back and to the right and the left. So the kind of parting that is prescribed in Islam is in the middle of the head. As for parting it on the side, this is not Islamically acceptable, because it may entail imitation of non-Muslims and it may also be included in the meaning of the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen, men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, maa’ilaat mumeelaat walking with an enticing gait (or turning away from righteousness and leading others astray) with their heads like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor smell its fragrance.” Some of the scholars interpreted the phrase al-maa’ilaat al-mumeelaat as referring to those women who style their hair in such a way that there is more hair on one side or who style the hair of others in that manner, but the correct view is that what is meant by al-maa’ilaat is those who turn away from what is enjoined upon them of modesty and religious commitment, and mumeelaat means those who turn others away from that. Parting the hair on the side was forbidden by some scholars on the grounds that it is imitation of kaafir women. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 17/126: With regard to parting the hair on the side, that is an imitation of kaafir women, and it is proven from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that it is forbidden to imitate the kuffaar. End quote. If we assume that parting the hair on the side, for example, was the sign of kaafir women or immoral women at one time, then that ceased to be the case and this became widespread among Muslim women, and no one would think that the one who does that is a kaafir or immoral woman, then in that case it is no longer regarded as imitation of the kuffaar, so it is not haraam. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (1/307), when discussing al-mayaasir al-arjawaan, which was a small pad or pillow that a horse-rider places beneath him, which was a custom of the non-Arabs: If we say that this is not allowed because it is an imitation of the non-Arabs, then this is for a religious purpose. But if that was one of their symbols at that time, when they were kuffaar, but it is no longer unique to them, then the idea of imitation no longer applies and it is no longer makrooh, end quote. He also said, refuting those who regarded wearing the taylasaan (a shawl-like garment worn over the head and shoulders) as imitation of the kuffaar, because it is the clothing of the Jews as mentioned in the hadeeth of the Dajjaal: It was appropriate to quote the story of the Jews as evidence at the time when the taylasaan was unique to them, but that is no longer the case, so nowadays it is one of the things that are permissible. Fath al-Baari, 10/274."
433,She sees a dry brownish-reddish spot a few days before her period,"Question I have a question about menstruation, which is that during the first three days I see a small dry spot which is sometimes brown and sometimes light red, and after that I see thick blood accompanied by pains for four days, then I see a light red stringy discharge for two days. My question is: what is the ruling on fasting and praying on the first and last days? I hope you will reply because I do not know how my acts of worship should be.","Praise be to Allah.The thick blood that is accompanied by pains for four days is undoubtedly menstruation. The brown and red spots that come before the period are subject to further discussion: If it is followed directly by the bleeding, then it is part of your period, so it is not permissible to pray and fast at that time. If it is separate from the bleeding, then it is not part of your period. The same applies to the stringy red discharge that you see for two days. If that happens before the tuhr [end of the period], then it is part of the period; if that happens after the tuhr, then it does not matter and it comes under the same ruling as the blood of istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding] and does not mean that you cannot fast or pray, but you should do wudoo’ at the time of each prayer. The tuhr or end of the period is indicated by one of two signs: either a clear discharge is emitted, or the place becomes dry, so that if it is wiped with a piece of cotton or something similar, it comes away clean with no trace of blood or yellowish or brownish discharge. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Before my period comes I have a brown discharge that lasts for five days, after which comes the menstrual blood. The menstrual blood lasts for eight days after the first five days. I pray on the five days but I wonder whether I should fast and pray on these days or not? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you. He replied: If the five days on which you have the brown discharge are separate from the days when you bleed, then this is not menstruation, and you have to pray on these days and can fast, but you should do wudoo’ for each prayer, because this comes under the same ruling as urine, not the rulings on menstruation. So it does not mean that you cannot pray and fast, but it does mean that you have to do wudoo’ every time, until that discharge stops, as in the case of istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding). But if these five days are followed immediately by your period, then they are part of your period, so you should not fast or pray on these days. Similarly, if this brownish or yellowish discharge comes after your period ends, it is not be regarded as part of the period, rather it comes under the ruling on istihaadah, so you have to wash your private parts with water and do wudoo’ for each prayer, and you should pray and fast, and not regard this as menstruation. You are also permissible for your husband, because Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “We used to think that the brownish and yellowish discharge after the end of the period did not matter.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh and by Abu Dawood; this version narrated by Abu Dawood). From Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 10/207 And Allaah knows best."
434,His wife does not want to wear hijaab and he fears for his young daughter,"Question My wife is not wearing Hijab although she is a strong beleiver and practicing all Salats on time etc. We are both Engineers and we have 2 young daughters (2 and 5 Years. I am worried that my children will also go away from wearing hijab if they see their mother not wearing it as well. I've tried many times to convince her to put it (she has read the relevant sourates) but I've stopped doing that when I felt that she would reject whatever she was already on. My question is as a husband and father, shall I force her to wear it anyway to preserve the future of the daughters or shall I keep patient untill Allah guides her? My second question is are we (the husbands) responsible in front of Allah regarding weather or not our wives / daughters wear hijab or not?","Praise be to Allah.Strong faith must have effects which can be seen in a person's appearance and conduct. If a person persists in sin, this is a sign of weak faith. What you have to do is try to plant the seeds of faith in her heart and help it to grow strong. What is meant by that is the kind of faith that will motivate a person to behave in accordance with the sharee’ah. Then try to instill in her a love of the hijaab and of righteous deeds, such as explaining the benefits of hijaab and how good it is, and giving her books and audio tapes, if these are available, which speak about that. One of the most important means which will help to achieve this is to put her in touch – in an indirect manner – with righteous women who wear the hijaab and try to have frequent family gatherings with righteous relatives. If you do this, you will have tried various means of convincing her. Then you will have to oblige her in an appropriate fashion and not allow her to go out to public places without hijaab. (It is important to explain to your daughter that hijaab is obligatory and tell her about Allaah’s ruling on hijaab, even if she realizes that her mother is falling short. You have to explain it to her at a level that she can understand so that she will see that there is a difference between the rulings of sharee’ah and the way her mother is behaving. Who knows – perhaps she will advise her mother, in the moving and innocent manner of children – to wear hijaab). With regard to the second question, there is no doubt that fathers are responsible if their wives and daughters do not wear hijaab and do not adhere to the rulings of sharee’ah, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones” [al-Tahreem 66:6] And as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock… the man is a shepherd over the members of his household and is responsible for his flock…” But if a person does all that he can and strives his utmost, but does not achieve any results, Allaah will excuse him and will not punish him; on the contrary, He will reward him for his efforts, and Allaah does not cause the reward for any good deed to be lost."
435,Does Smoking Break Your Fast?,Question Some people say that fasting is not invalidated by smoking; because it is not food or drink. What is your opinion about this?,"Praise be to Allah.Sheikh Ibn Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “I think that this is a view for which there is no basis. Rather smoking is a kind of drinking; in Arabic they say that one “drinks” a cigarette. Moreover, there is no doubt that smoking reaches the stomach and the inside of the body, and everything that reaches the stomach and the inside of the body invalidates the fast , whether it is beneficial or harmful, even if a person were to swallow a bead from the masbahah, or a piece of iron, or anything else, it invalidates the fast. So it is not essential that the thing that invalidates the fast, or that is eaten or drunk, should be nourishing or beneficial. Everything that reaches the stomach is regarded as food or drink. They believe – indeed they know – that this is a kind of drink, and if anyone says this then he is being arrogant. Moreover, I think that the month of Ramadan is an opportunity for the one who is sincerely resolved and wants to give up this foul, harmful habit of smoking. I think that it is an opportunity because he is going to abstain from it throughout the day in Ramadan, and at night he can distract himself from it by means of the food and drink that Allah has permitted to him, and by frequenting the mosques and attending gatherings of righteous people, and he can keep away from those who have this habit. If he abstains from it throughout the month, then that will be a great help to him in giving it up for the rest of his life. This is an opportunity which smokers should not miss.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, Fatawa Al-Siyam, pp. 203-204) For more about smoking, please see these answers: 36301 , 11286 , 10922 , 9083 , and 70305 . And Allah knows best."
436,Expecting the wife or her guardian to provide the dowry or accommodation is a custom that is contrary to sharee‘ah,"Question Its been a customary practice in my locality that during the time of marriage the girls parents build a house for their daughter and that both couples may live in that house.But in future if any problem occurs between husband and wife then the wife could still have her house while the male has no right to claim the house.This system was made lawful in my place to give security for females. Now that am going to be engaged my Dad said that the fiancee's family haven't built a house yet.And dad fears that the fiancee's parents haven't come up with good security even for their daughter and he fears in future I might not get a good security from them as well.And dad said he will ask them for the house for both(me and fiancee) to live in. I said since it is the husband who should give security to his spouse then it is not necessary for the fiancee's parents to build the house.But i also said if they build it without our own demand let us take it and i said that after reading the following verse of the quran from surah Nisa 004.004 And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer. But in my situation I fear falling into dowry.Please sheikh kindly clear this doubt.Under the circumstance i have said is it right of my father to ask the fiancee's parents to build the house for the girl so that we both can live in it? Please reply shiekh for a long time i haven't got any reply from u. But Allah knows hw busy u are.But please take some time to clear this for me.","Praise be to Allah. The dowry (mahr) is a right that the wife has over her husband, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)” [al-Nisa’ 4:4]. Al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, meant by that is: Give the women their dowries as a gift that is required and obligatory. And he said: It was narrated that Qataadah said, concerning the words “And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart”: As an obligation. And it was narrated that Ibn Jurayj said concerning the words “And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart”: As an obligation that is named (specified). And it was narrated that Ibn Zayd said concerning the words “And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart”: al-nihlah (translated here as “with a good heart”, in the language of the Arabs, refers to something that is obligatory. End quote from Tafseer al-Tabari, 4/241. So it is not permissible to force the wife or her guardian to provide it, but if the wife takes it and then gives some of it to her husband or gives some of her wealth to him, it is permissible to her to do that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)”[al-Nisa’ 4:4]. Accommodation is also a right that the wife has over her husband, so he is obliged to provide her with separate accommodation according to his ability; that is part of the maintenance that he is obliged to provide. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Lodge them (divorced women) where you dwell, according to your means” [al-Talaaq 65:6]. If this applies in the case of a woman who is divorced, then providing accommodation for a woman who is still married is more appropriate. Moreover, Allah has enjoined kind treatment between spouses, as stated above. Part of the kind treatment that is enjoined is providing her with accommodation in which she and her wealth will be safe. The wife cannot do without accommodation in order to conceal her from people looking at her and so that she can settle down with her belongings. Hence accommodation is a right that she has over her husband. The same may be said about accommodation as may be said about the dowry: it is not permissible to force the wife or her guardian to provide it. Based on that, if the wife does not give accommodation, there is no room for demanding it from her. You should explain that to your father and not go along with the custom that is contrary to sharee‘ah. Allah has made the man the protector and maintainer of the woman, and one of the reasons for that is that he spends on her. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]. See also the answer to question no. 45527. And Allah knows best."
437,Can the foetus be aborted if the mother reads Soorat az-Zalzalah?,"Question One of the women is saying that if a pregnant woman reads Soorat az-Zalzalah, the foetus will be miscarried because of reading this soorah. She also says that if she goes for ruqyah as prescribed in Islam, she had to tell the raaqi that she is pregnant so that he can avoid reciting Soorat az-Zalzalah over her, so that the foetus will not be miscarried. Is this true? May Allah reward you with the best of rewards and benefit the ummah by means of you.","Praise be to Allah. The Muslim should not believe that any harm may be caused by reciting some soorahs of the Qur’an; this notion is contrary to the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing” [Fussilat 41:44]. There is nothing in the books of the fuqaha’ or scholars, or in the reports from the righteous early generations that anyone used to warn pregnant women against reading Soorat az-Zalzalah; rather those who had memorised the Holy Qur’an, both men and women, have always been eager to complete the recitation of the Qur’an within the period in which they usually do that, without any exception. The one who dares to warn against reading a specific soorah -- even in a specific situation -- has dared to do something serious. Yes, it cannot be denied that this soorah or others may be beneficial in making it easier for the pregnant woman to deliver the baby if that is proven by experience, but that does not imply the opposite, that it could lead to miscarriage at the beginning of the pregnancy, because there can be no evil or harm in the words of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, under any circumstances. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter on difficult birth: al-Khallaal said: ‘Abdullah ibn Ahmad told me: I saw my father writing for women who had difficulty in giving birth, on a white cup or something clean; he would write the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him): “There is no god but Allah, the Most Forbearing, the Most Generous; Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Mighty Throne; praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. ‘On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day. (O mankind! This Quran is sufficient as) a clear Message (or proclamation to save yourself from destruction)’ [al-Ahqaaf 46:35]; ‘as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an afternoon or a morning’ [Naazi‘aat 79:46].” Al-Khallaal said: Abu Bakr al-Marwazi told us that a man came to Abu ‘Abdullah and said: O Abu ‘Abdullah, will you write something for a woman who has been having difficulties in labour for two days? He said: Tell him to bring a large cup and some saffron. And I saw him writing for more than one person and narrating from ‘Ikrimah that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘Eesa (blessings and peace of Allah be upon our Prophet and upon him) passed by a cow that was having difficulty giving birth and she said: O Word of Allah, pray to Allah to relieve me of the difficulty I am in. He said: O Creator of a soul from another soul, the One who delivers one soul from another, deliver her. Then she delivered her calf and stood up and began to smell him. He said: So if a woman is having difficulty in childbirth, write this for her. And the ruqyah mentioned above, if you write it for her it will be beneficial. End quote. Zaad al-Ma‘aad, 4/326 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question: Are there any verses that could be recited in order to make childbirth easier for the woman? He replied: I do not know anything of that nature from the Sunnah, but if one recites over the woman whose labour has begun verses that speak of ease, such as “Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you”[al-Baqarah 2:185]; or that speak of pregnancy and childbirth, such as: “nor does a female conceive (within her womb), nor brings forth (young), except by His Knowledge” [Fussilat 41:47]; or “When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake, And when the earth throws out its burdens” [az-Zalzalah 99:1-2], – that will be beneficial, by Allah’s leave. All of the Qur’an is healing; if the reciter and the one over whom it is recited both believe in its effects, then it will inevitably have an effect, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We send down from the Qur’an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers) nothing but loss” [al-Isra’ 17:82]. This verse is general in meaning: healing and mercy includes healing of hearts from the diseases of doubts and whims and desires, as well as healing of bodies from chronic diseases. End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, Fataawa al-‘Aqeedah/al-‘Ibaadah, tape no. 257, side A. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: As for experience, if you go through an experience and you reach a conclusion that has a basis in Islamic texts, then this is a confirmation of what is in the texts. But if the conclusion refers to something that is not mentioned in the texts, then there are two scenarios: if this conclusion is based on empirical science, then undoubtedly it is valid and is to be taken into account; if, however, it has to do with shar ‘i matters, then it is not to be taken into account (because there is no reference to it in the Islamic texts). There is a basis for seeking healing by means of the Holy Qur’an, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We send down from the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe” [al-Isra’ 17:82]. There is a basis for this, so if some particular verses of the Qur’an are tried for some disease and prove to be beneficial, this experience is confirmation of what it says in the Qur’an about it being a healing for people. With regard to matters other than worship, it is undoubtedly subject to experience and empirical science. If a person, for example, has knowledge and experience of what the earth produces of herbs and the like, and he goes out to the countryside and gathers what he thinks is beneficial and tries it, then whatever conclusions he reaches may be valid. End quote from al-Liqa’ ash-Shahri, no. 37, question no. 26 To sum up: none of the soorahs of the Qur’an can harm a pregnant or breastfeeding woman or anyone else; rather they are good and beneficial, and bring barakah (blessing) to the one who recites them and the one who listens to them, by Allah’s leave. And Allah knows best."
438,Ruling on aborting a deformed foetus,"Question A woman is pregnant and has had several scans, which show that there are deformities in the foetus. Is it permissible to abort it?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We have already stated in the answer to question no. 12118 the ruling on aborting a foetus that is physically deformed, and that this is permissible before the soul is breathed into the foetus, i.e., before 120 days of pregnancy have passed. This is allowed after exhausting all possible means of treating the problem. But after the soul has been breathed into the foetus it is not permissible to abort it because of deformity. The parents have to be patient and accept the will and decree of Allaah, and remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): “and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know” [al-Baqarah 2:216] “it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good” [al-Nisa’ 4:19] And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that applies to no one but the believer. If something good happens to him he gives thanks and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 2999. Secondly: Here we will add something from a fatwa of the Standing Committee concerning this matter. The Standing Committee was asked about aborting a pregnancy in the fifth month, after scans proved that the foetus was deformed and the top of the skull was absent. They replied: It is not permissible to abort the foetus because of the deformity mentioned in the question. Allaah may heal the foetus during the remainder of the pregnancy, and it may be born normal and healthy, as has happened to many people. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 21/440. They were also asked about a pregnant woman who was treated for cancer with radiotherapy, which would affect the foetus and cause it to be born deformed – is it permissible to abort it? They replied: It is not permissible to abort the foetus which it is feared may be deformed. Rather the matter should be left to the will of Allaah; it may be free of deformity. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 21/249. They were also asked about a woman in the fifth month of pregnancy; scans had shown the presence of several deformities in the foetus which made the doctors sure that it would die after birth. These deformities were as follows: a deformity in the heart, a severe deformity of the spinal cord and spinal column, the size of the head is very small, there is a large sac between the head and body that is bigger than the head, the intestines are outside the abdominal cavity, and there is a deformity in the brain. Is it permissible to abort it? They replied: After studying the question, the Committee replied that it is not permissible to abort this pregnancy, because often the doctor’s reports are speculative, and the basic principle is that the foetus must be respected and it is forbidden to abort it, because Allaah may make the foetus whole during the remainder of the pregnancy, so it may be born free of the things that the doctors mentioned, even if what they said was correct. We must think positively of Allaah and ask Him to heal him and make him whole, and to cause him to be born healthy. His parents have to fear Allaah and ask Him to heal him from all ills and to delight them with a healthy child. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘I am as My slave thinks I am.’” Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 21/250-251. They were also asked about a woman in the fifth month of pregnancy, whose foetus has some deformities which expose the mother’s life to danger. Is it permissible to abort it? They replied: After studying the question, the Committee replied that if the situation is as described, and continuation of the pregnancy to full term will result in danger to the mother’s life, then there is nothing wrong with aborting the pregnancy before it reaches full term, in order to protect the mother’s life. But if the abortion is because of the deformities only, then it is not permissible to abort the pregnancy. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 21/452."
439,Tafseer on the basis of narrated texts and tafseer on the basis of individual understanding,Question I have heard that it is not permissible to interpret the meanings of the Qur’an on the basis of one's individual understanding. Can you explain what is meant by this?,"Praise be to Allah. When explaining the meanings of a verse of the Qur’an, the mufassir (scholarly commentator on the meanings) follows one of two methods: The first method is to see whether there is anything in the texts of the Qur’an or the Prophet’s Sunnah, or in texts narrated from the righteous early generations, that explains this verse. If there is an explanation of it in these sources, he follows it and is content with it. This is what is called “tafseer on the basis of narrated texts”; it is of several types: 1. Tafseer of the Qur’an by the Qur’an: as some parts of the Qur’an explain other parts. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 93): If someone were to ask: what are the soundest ways of interpreting the meanings of the Qur’an? The answer is that the soundest way of doing that is to interpret the Qur’an by the Qur’an, because sometimes it may refer to a matter in brief, then explain it in more detail elsewhere, or it may state something in a few words in one place, then expand upon it elsewhere. End quote. Some examples of that: Al-Bukhaari (4236) narrated from ‘Alqamah (may Allah have mercy on him) that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the verse “…and confuse not their belief with Zulm (wrong)…” [al-An‘aam 6:82] was revealed, his companions (i.e., the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: Which of us has not done wrong? Then the verse “Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm (wrong) indeed” [Luqmaan 31:13] was revealed. [From the latter verse it is understood that the zulm referred to in the first verse is the zulm of shirk (joining others in worship with Allah), and not any lesser wrongdoing.] But although interpreting the Qur’an by the Qur’an may sometimes be unambiguous and clear, as in the example mentioned above, in which case it is binding proof that must be followed and not opposed, sometimes it is based on the mufassir’s own ijtihaad and understanding, when he is trying to put together similar verses. Undoubtedly this is of a lesser status than the above, because the one who engages in ijithaad may be wrong or right. 2. The tafseer of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), explaining the meanings of the Qur’an, because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to both convey and explain to us what is said in the holy Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought” [an-Nahl 16:44]. An example of that: Al-Bukhaari (4510) narrated concerning the interpretation of the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. It was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, what is the meaning of the white thread being distinct from the black thread? Are they two threads? He said: “The back of your heard must be very broad if you want to watch the two threads.” [‘Adiyy was thinking in terms of threads in a literal sense, which he wanted to put under his pillow and examine to see when they became distinct from one another with the approach of dawn, but the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) pointed out that if he wanted to put the two threads – which in fact refers to the light of dawn being distinct from the darkness of night – under his pillow, then his pillow must be very big indeed, in which case he must have a very large head! – Translator’s note]. Then he said: “No; rather it is the darkness of the night and the light of the day.” If an explanation of a verse or a word in the Qur’an has reached us from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it is obligatory for us to adhere to it and be content with it. The interpretation of a verse may be understood from the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), from his actions and words, and from the things that he approved of. The Sunnah came to explain the Qur’an. Allah, may He be exalted, has instructed us to pray, give zakaah, perform Hajj, carry out the hadd punishments and so on, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), through his Sunnah – his actions and words – has explained to us in detail what is meant by these words. But if the mufassir cannot find any explanation for a verse in the Sunnah, he should look at the sayings of the Sahaabah. 3. Tafseer based on reports from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them): Their tafseer takes precedence over that of anyone else, because their tafseer is likely to be based on what they learned from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: One of us would learn ten verses then he would not move on (and learn more) until he understood their meaning and put them into practice. Narrated by at-Tabari in his Tafseer (1/80); its isnaad was classed as saheeh by Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir (may Allah have mercy on him). In some cases the tafseer of the Sahaabah was based on their own ijtihaad and understanding, and their ijtihaad takes precedence over that of those who came after them, because they accompanied the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and were aware of the circumstances in which the verses of the Qur’an were revealed, such as the reasons for revelation and the place where revelation came down. They were contemporaries who were well aware of the reality of the circumstances in which the Qur’an was revealed and how people were at that time. Moreover, they had a greater understanding than others of the language in which the Qur’an was revealed; they had deeper knowledge, were less complicated (i.e., they were straightforward people), and the furthest removed from misguidance and error in terms of their knowledge and deeds. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 95): Then if you do not find the explanation of the meaning in either the Qur’an or the Sunnah, you should refer to the words of the Sahaabah, because they had greater knowledge of that, because of what they witnessed of the Qur’an, and because of the advantages they had, and what they had of perfect understanding and sound knowledge, especially the scholars and leading figures among them… End quote. The views of the Sahaabah concerning tafseer take precedence over the views of anyone else, unless the Sahaabah differed concerning it, in which case the mufassir must try to work out which view is most correct. 4. Tafseer based on reports from the Taabi‘een If the mufassir does not find anything in the words of the Sahaabah to explain the meaning of the verse, then he should look at the tafseer of the Taabi‘een, who acquired their knowledge from the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), because in their circumstances, words, deeds and time they were – naturally – closer to the Sahaabah and to their teachings and were able to learn from them directly. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Muqaddimah fi Usool at-Tafseer (p. 102): if you do not find the explanation of the meaning in either the Qur’an or the Sunnah, and you do not find it in what is reported from the Sahaabah, in that case many of the imams (leading scholars) turned to the views of the Taabi‘een… End quote. He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said (p. 37): Among the Taabi‘een are some who learned all their tafseer from the Sahaabah, as Mujaahid said: I showed the Mushaf to Ibn ‘Abbaas, pausing at each verse and asking him about it. Hence ath-Thawri said: If the interpretation of the meaning of a verse comes to you from Mujaahid, it is sufficient for you. Hence ash-Shaafa‘i, al-Bukhaari and other scholars relied on his (Mujaahid’s) tafseer. End quote. If the scholars of tafseer among the Taabi‘een are agreed upon a view concerning the meaning of a verse, then undoubtedly it is obligatory to follow it. But if they differed, the view of one of them is not necessarily stronger than that of another and cannot be given precedence over another or be regarded as the ultimate proof. Rather it must be examined and his proof may be quoted or referred to, (but it is not binding proof). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Undoubtedly the Taabi‘een differed, but those who learned tafseer from the Sahaabah are not equal to those who did not do so. However, if they did not state that they learned it from a Sahaabi, then their view is not proof against those who came after them, if they differed in their views, because they are not of the same status as the Sahaabah, but their views are more likely to be closer to the truth. The closer people are to the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), the more likely they are to be correct than those who come after them. This is very clear, because of the prevalence of whims and desires in subsequent periods, and because of the presence of numerous intermediaries between them and the time of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Undoubtedly this distance detracts from the value of their opinions; hence we know that referring to the view of earlier generations is very important. End quote from Sharh Muqaddimat at-Tafseer, p. 140 The second method is for the mufassir who has knowledge of tafseer to use his understanding to interpret the meaning of the verse of the Qur’an, and his ijtihaad must be based on the proper method, following the guidelines and principles of tafseer. This is what is called tafseer on the basis of individual understanding and ijtihaad. Az-Zarqaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Manaahil al-‘Irfaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’an (2/43): With regard to the permissible type of tafseer on the basis of one's understanding, it is essential to be aware of what has been narrated from the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his companions that may give the mufassir some insight into how he should interpret the meaning on the basis of his understanding. The one who does that must also have extensive knowledge of the rules of the Arabic language and its styles and manner of expression, as well as deep insight into the rules of sharee‘ah, so that he will be able to interpret the words of Allah on the basis of what is well established of the rules and regulations of His sharee‘ah. End quote. Tafseer that is based on one’s individual understanding is blameworthy in the following scenarios: 1. When the one who is seeking to interpret the meaning is not qualified to do so, and he is trying to explain the words of Allah without knowledge. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge’” [al-A‘raaf 7:33]; “O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy” [al-Baqarah 2:168-169]. 2. When he is following his own whims and desires and his aim is to support his bid‘ah (innovation) and opinion, even if that is by twisting the meanings of the words or not paying attention to the proper way of understanding, the ways in which the Arabs express different ideas in their language, and the guidelines of sharee‘ah, as some innovators among the Raafidis and others did, when they interpreted some verses in a manner that is contrary to what is indicated by the guidelines of sharee‘ah and knowledge of the Arabic language. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Interpretation of the Qur’an based on individual opinion: sometimes, in order to be in harmony with his preconceived ideas, as the followers of whims and desires do, a person may say that what is meant by a given word or phrase is such and such – saying something that is in harmony with his preconceived ideas. That includes some later scholars who interpreted the Qur’an in such a manner as to be in harmony with the latest scientific discoveries – whether astronomical or terrestrial – when the Qur’an does not indicate that. In that case they are interpreting the Qur’an on the basis of their own preconceived views, because the Qur’an does not indicate that, either on the basis of the text or of what is indicated by the language. This is their own opinion, and it is not right to interpret the Qur’an on that basis. Similarly, if a person does not understand the linguistic meaning or the shar‘i meaning indicated by the verse, if he then says something without knowledge, he is sinning, such as if one of the common folk were to interpret the verse of the holy Qur’an according to his understanding, without basing it on proper understanding of the linguistic or shar‘i guidelines, in which case it is haraam for him to do that, because the one who interprets the meanings of the Qur’an is testifying that Allah meant such and such. This is a very serious matter, because Allah has forbidden us to say about Him that which we do not know. “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge’” [al-A‘raaf 7:33]. Any person who says about Allah that which he does not know about the meaning of His words or any of His rulings has made a serious error.

440,Their parents invested wealth for them but they did not pay zakaah on it. What should they do?,"Question I am a young man, twenty-six years old. My father invested money for us in a mudaarabah (investment) company, and I did not know about it until now. When I saw the mudaarabah contract, one of its clauses said the following: The mudaarib (investor) must pay the zakaah on his wealth himself. My question is: what is the amount of zakaah that I have to pay, because this investment was made twenty-four years ago and no zakaah has been paid on it? Must it be paid from the same capital that was invested, or is it permissible to pay it from somewhere else, as I am working and have an income?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: You stated that this money was invested in a mudaarabah company, but not all kinds of wealth that are put into company shares are subject to zakaah. Rather the matter is subject to further discussion. We have discussed that in the answer to question no. 69912. If zakaah is due on this wealth, then you must hasten to pay it and we ask Allaah to accept it from you. Secondly: Delaying payment of zakaah, whether that is for a valid reason or otherwise, is not waived with the passage of time, because it is a right that Allaah has given to the poor and needy, and the others who are entitled to it. Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (5/302): If many years have passed and he has not paid zakaah on it, he must pay zakaah on all of it. End quote. It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (23/298): If many years have passed in which the one who was obliged to pay zakaah did not pay it, but the conditions of it being obligatory were met, no part of it is waived, according to scholarly consensus and he must pay zakaah for all the years that have passed when he did not pay zakaah. End quote. See also question no. 69798. What you must to is hasten to pay zakaah for all the years that have passed before you procrastinate further. The ruling does not differ, whether this wealth belongs to your father or it belongs to you and he invested it for you, because zakaah is due in both cases. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a man who died and owed zakaah: should it be paid and given priority over division of the state? He replied: If this man used to pay zakaah during his lifetime, but a full year had passed when he died (for which he did not pay zakaah), then his heirs must pay zakaah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Pay off the dues of Allaah, for the dues of Allaah are most deserving of being paid off. But if he deliberately did not pay zakaah and withheld it out of stinginess, then this is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. In order to be on the safe side – and Allaah knows best – the zakaah should be paid, because it has to do with the rights of those who are entitled to zakaah and is not waived. The rights of those who are entitled to zakaah take precedence over the rights of the heir with regard to this wealth, but the duty of the deceased is not discharged in this case, because he persisted in not paying it. And Allaah knows best. Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/no. 43. Thirdly: There is nothing wrong with paying zakaah from wealth other than that on which zakaah is due, such as if you pay it from your salary or otherwise. This has been stated by the scholars. Ibn Qudaamah said: Paying zakaah from something other than the nisaab is permissible. Al-Mughni, 2/287 Some of the scholars narrated that there was consensus on this point. ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Ahmad al-Bukhaari said: According to consensus, it is permissible to pay the share of the poor from something other than the nisaab. Kashf al-Asraar, 3/370 And Allaah knows best."
441,Reconciling between the hadeeth which says that whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah will enter Paradise and the idea that the mushrikeen will abide in Hell forever,"Question How can we reconcile between the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “There is no slave who says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah then dies believing in that but he will enter Paradise,” and the idea that the mushrikeen and hypocrites will abide in Hell forever even though they said Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah?.","Praise be to Allah. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The hadeeth indicates that the one who says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah is a true believer, but he is tempted by his whims and desires, so he does some acts of disobedience or major sins such as stealing etc. The belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah is that the destiny of the believer, even if he commits a major sin, is Paradise. Whatever punishment may come before Paradise is up to Allaah: if He wills, He will punish him, and if He wills, He will forgive him. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills” [al-Nisa’ 4:48] So all those who committed sins – even if they were major sins – if the sins were less than kufr, they will not be prevented from entering Paradise. For the destiny of the one who did them is Paradise, but he may be punished for the sins that he committed, or Allaah may forgive him. The matter rests with Allaah. As for the hypocrites and followers of bid’ahs which put a person beyond the pale of Islam, they did not really say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah meaning it from the heart, because this hypocrisy which led to kufr is the opposite of sincerity, and sincerity is essential to saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah. If a person says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, but he believes that there is no God, or he believes that there is another god alongside Allaah who controls the universe, or he believes that all the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) apostatized after his death, or other bid’ahs that put a person beyond the pale of Islam, then such people are not sincere in their saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, because their bid’ah goes against the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever bears witness that there is no god except Allaah or says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, will enter Paradise.” The Shahaadatayn must be spoken with sincerity. Listen to what Allaah says concerning the munaafiqeen (interpretation of the meaning): “And when they [the hypocrites] stand up for As-Salaah (the prayer), they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allaah but little” [al-Nisa’ 4:142] In the same passage, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them” [al-Nisa’ 4:145] And Allaah says of them (interpretation of the meaning): “When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad), they say: ‘We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allaah’” [al-Munaafiqoon 63:1] This is merely verbal testimony, but: “Allaah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed” [al-Munaafiqoon 63:1 – interpretation of the meaning] i.e., that they are lying when they say, “We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allaah”. For they mention Allaah and bear witness to His Messenger, but their hearts are devoid of that which is uttered by their lips."
442,Gathering to eat and celebrate on the last day of Sha’baan,"Question Some families get together on the last night of Sha’baan and make food, and some of their lders recite poems for this occasion. What is the ruling on this getting together to eat?","Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Sahykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who replied as follows: I think that this is closer to bid’ah (innovation), and it should be disallowed rather than permitted, because it is being taken as an “Eid” (regular celebration). If it happened only once, then it is OK. Our response is: we do not allow it. And Allaah knows best."
443,"He had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan, under the influence of drugs","Question I am married, and I used to be addicted to drugs. Praise be to Allah, Allah turned to me in mercy and I recovered. My question is: I had intercourse with my wife during the day in Ramadan on nearly ten days or more, when I was not in a normal state because of taking drugs, but I am not able to fast two months for each day. Can I feed the poor? What should I do to discharge my obligations? I have repented and I deeply regret what happened.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: We congratulate you for your repentance and your recovery from these evil drugs, and we ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make us, you and all the Muslims steadfast in obeying Him, may He be exalted, until we meet Him when He is pleased with us. Secondly: Whoever has intercourse deliberately during the day in Ramadan has rendered his fast invalid. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We do not know of any difference of opinion among the scholars regarding the fact that the one who has intercourse in the vagina, whether he ejaculates or not, or does not penetrate the vagina but he ejaculates, has rendered his fast invalid. This is proven by the saheeh reports. End quote from al-Mughni (4/372). Whoever renders his fast invalid in Ramadan by having intercourse must do two things: He must make up that day That is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the one who had intercourse during the day in Ramadan to fast one day to replace that day, as he said to him: “And fast one day, and seek Allah’s forgiveness.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (2393) and Ibn Maajah (1671); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel (4/93) An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In addition to offering expiation, he must also make up the day on which he had intercourse. This is the well-known view of our madhhab, although there was a difference of opinion concerning it, as mentioned above. Al-‘Abdari said that it is obligatory to make up that day; this is the view of all the fuqaha’ apart from al-Awzaa‘i… End quote from al-Majmoo‘ (6/344-345 Expiation (kafaarah) It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Whilst we were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, I am doomed! He said: “What is the matter with you?” He said: I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked: “Can you afford to free a slave?” He said: No. He said: “Are you able to fast for two consecutive months?” He said: No. He said: “Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?” He said: No. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) paused for a while, and whilst we were like that, a large basket of dates was brought to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). He said: “Where is the one who was asking?” The man said: I am here. He said: “Take it and give it in charity.”. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1936) and Muslim (1111). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Intercourse in the vagina requires expiation, and it is as if there is consensus on this matter; there are only a few odd dissenting views. End quote from Sharh al-‘Umdah (4/284) The expiation referred to in the hadith quoted above is mentioned in order of precedence. The one who breaks the fast by having intercourse must free a slave; if he cannot do that, then he must fast for two consecutive months; if he cannot do that, then he must feed sixty poor persons. This is the view of the majority of scholars. Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars differed concerning the expiation that is required of the one who has intercourse during the day when fasting. One group said that he must free a slave; if he cannot afford to do that, he must fast for two consecutive months; if he is not able to do that, he must feed sixty poor persons. This is the view of Sufyaan ath-Thawri, al-Awzaa‘i, ash-Shaafa‘i, Ahmad, Abu Thawr, an-Nu‘maan and his two companions. End quote from al-Ishraaf (3/121). Secondly: If someone consumes or drinks something in Ramadan that causes him to become intoxicated, then he has intercourse with his wife, he cannot be excused from having to offer expiation on the grounds that he was under the influence of the intoxicant, rather the reason for the expiation is still applicable in his case, which is that he transgressed the sanctity of the month by having intercourse, to which is added the fact that he consumed something unlawful, so his sin is greater. >> That is because he knew, when he was sober, that he should keep away from intoxicants, but he did not do that, so he is to be punished for what he did. See: Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (33/103, 108); and I‘laam al-Muwaqqi‘een (5/196). Thirdly: If fasting was obligatory for the wife on those days, and she willingly went along with him with regard to having intercourse, even though she knew that it was not permissible for her to do that, she must also make up those days and offer expiation for them. But if she was forced, or fasting was not obligatory for her on those days, or she was unaware of the ruling, in the sense that she thought that it was obligatory for her to obey her husband in that, then in this case she does not have to offer expiation. This has been discussed previously in question no. 106532. Conclusion: You have to offer expiation for these days on which you had intercourse. If you are not able to free a slave, and you have a valid reason for which you are not able to offer the expiatory fast, then you must feed sixty poor persons for each day that you had intercourse, and you must make up each day. The amount of food to be given when feeding the poor has been explained in question no. 106535. And Allah knows best."
444,what food provoke desire?,"Question Being a single young student living in london. I would like to know which foods increase the sexual desire in the human body, and what element in food is responsible for this.","Praise be to Allah.We urge you to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to food. It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’diYakrab said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls to give him enough strength. If his desire for food overwhelms him, then let him fill one-third with food, one-third with drink and leave one-third for air.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-At’imah, 3340; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 2704). Hence some of the scholars included this hadeeth under the heading of controlling desires. You should also fast a lot, heeding the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever is not able to do that then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined fasting . So you must also pay attention to the commands of the Allaah, such as lowering the gaze and keeping away from places where men mix with women. If you have the means to get married then hasten to do so, following the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned above. With regard to the effects that different foods have, we suggest you refer to the books of nutritional experts. And Allaah is the Source of strength."
445,Ruling on rolling up sleeves during prayer,"Question Does rolling up the sleeves count as part of the tucking up (of clothes or hair) that is not allowed during prayer? If it is part of that tucking up, then is the ruling different if I start praying with my sleeves rolled up, i.e., I did not roll them up during the prayer – or is it the same thing?","Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to roll up the sleeves or to fold them up before the prayer or during the prayer so that they will not touch the ground when doing sujood, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have been commanded to pray on seven bones and not to tuck up my hair or my clothes.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."
446,"If he missed something at the beginning of Taraweeh, how can he make it up?","Question If I enter the mosque late for ‘Isha’ prayer and I missed the ‘Isha’ prayer in congregation and I pray it on my own, and I am late in joining the Taraweeh prayers because of doing ‘Isha’, and I miss two rak’ahs of Taraweeh, how should I do these two rak’ahs? Alone or what?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: If you miss ‘Isha’ and you arrive when the imam is praying Taraweeh, it is better for you to join him with the intention of praying ‘Isha’. When he says the salaam, you should complete your prayer and not pray alone or with another jamaa’ah (congregation), so that there will not be two jamaa’ahs at the same time, which may lead to distraction due to the intermingling of voices. Secondly: As for what you have missed of Taraweeh, if you wish you may do it, so you may pray two rak’ahs when the imam prays Witr, then pray what you missed, then pray Witr. What is meant by praying two rak’ahs when the imam prays Witr is that you do not say salaam with him when he ends his Witr, rather you should stand up and pray another rak’ah, then say the salaam. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: If I join the people when they are praying Taraweeh and I have missed part of it, should I make up what I have missed after Witr or what should I do? He replied: Do not make up what you have missed after Witr, rather if you want to make up what you have missed, then pray two rak’ahs when the imam prays Witr, then offer the prayers you missed, then pray Witr. Here there is an issue to which attention should be drawn: If you arrive when the imam is praying Taraweeh and you did not pray ‘Isha’ yet, what should you do? Should you pray ‘Isha’ on your own or join the imam in Taraweeh with the intention of praying ‘Isha’? The answer is that you should join the imam in Taraweeh with the intention of praying ‘Isha’. When the imam says salaam from Taraweeh, then stand up and make up the rest of ‘Isha’. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned the exact same issue, and this was also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and this is the correct view, because the correct view is that it is permissible to offer an obligatory prayer in congregation behind an imam who is offering a naafil prayer, based on the evidence of the hadeeth of Mu’aadh ibn Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said that he used to pray ‘Isha’ with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he would go back to his people and lead them in offering that prayer – it was naafil for him and obligatory for them. End quote from al-Liqa’ al-Shahri. It is better for you to make it up in congregation if you can, but if that is not possible then there is nothing wrong with you making it up on your own. And Allaah knows best."
447,"He wants to stay up and he disturbs his wife, and she is complaining about his actions. Should he divorce her?","Question My wife does not listen to what I say. I am always working outside the house, from 5 PM until 1 AM. When I come home, I tell her to make the food and she makes it, but because she and I live in one room with my children, of whom we have two, when I sit at the computer or to watch television, she sits and yells because she wants to sleep. But when I am outside the house why doesn't she sleep and rest then?! Every day is like this. What should I do? Should I divorce her or what?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: Both spouses should realise that the basis of married life is mutual understanding and its pillars are love and compassion. Hence their married life cannot be complete unless there is kind treatment on both sides. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably” [al-Nisa 4:19]. Ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Each spouse must treat the other in a kind and decent manner, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably” [al-Nisa 4:19] “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable” [al-Baqarah 2:228]. If the spouses treat one another in a kind and decent manner, that will preserve love between them and make life more pleasant. How often has separation occurred because of the lack of kind and decent treatment. If each of them feared Allah and treated the other in a kind and decent manner, giving them their due rights, much good and blessing would be achieved thereby. But if there are arguments between the spouses, you find that most of them are caused by the lack of kind and decent treatment; the husband beats his wife for the slightest thing, or she is stubborn and argues with him about the slightest thing. Hence each spouse must treat the other in a kind and decent manner, as Allah has commanded. End quote from al-Liqa’ al-Shahri. With regard to your situation, there is something that should be pointed out, and we hope that you will agree to that which is best for you and your children: 1. We think that it is essential for you to give the children their own room, separate from yours -- if possible -- and make your bedroom private. 2. Beware of spending the night in anything that is not pleasing to Allah. Your work involves staying up at night, then when you come home and eat dinner, it will be more or less the last third of the night, and it is not good for you to spend this time watching TV or at the computer with things in which there is no benefit or which are haram. This time is for sleeping for the one who has spent her night waiting for you and serving you. It is your wife's right to spend this time sleeping, so that she can get up in the day to serve you and to serve your children, and you do not have the right to disturb her or spoil the quality of her sleep, because it is her right over you to be treated in a kind and decent manner, and you are not doing that according to what you have told us, whereas we see that she waits for you and prepares dinner for you, and what you are criticising her for we do not see as anything to be blamed; rather she is in the right. Just as the wife is required to pay attention to her husband's work and appreciate the effort he is putting into it, the husband should also take an interest in his wife's work in her house and appreciate her serving him and taking care of the children. What the wife does is much greater than what the husband does. If you are working from 5 PM until one at night, your wife is working all around the clock. Even in her sleep, she does not rest; if one of the children cries or needs something, she is the one who gets up to take care of him and look after him, not you. After that, is it appropriate for you to deprive her of her fair share of sleep in which she can rest from the burdens of housework? How can you expect her to sleep at a time other than her time for sleeping? If you want her to stay at night with you, do you think that she can take care of your house during the day? We think that you are spending the day sleeping until noon, because of your work and staying up late. Is there any housewife who can do that? Indeed, what you are demanding is not in accordance with either sharee’ah or reason; what your wife is doing is in accordance with both. 3. We advise the wife to remember that it is essential to treat her husband kindly and not to raise her voice or yell when asking for her rights. This is not befitting for the wise Muslim woman to do. The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said: What is prescribed is for the spouses to address one another in a way that will create love and strength in the marital bonds, and each of them should avoid raising the voice to one another or addressing one another in ways that they dislike, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably” [al-Nisa 4:19]. And she should not raise her voice to him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable” [al-Baqarah 2:228]. But the husband should treat her in the way that is better, so that the conflict will not be exacerbated. And Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. End quote. Finally: We advise you to fear Allah and to treat your wife in a kind and decent manner. We also advise you to keep your wife and to give her her rights of love and compassion. We ask Allah to reconcile your hearts and to set your affairs straight and to help you and your children. And Allah knows best."
448,Times of prayer and fasting in the polar regions,Question I am a non muslim who currently live in a muslim country. It is my understanding that the 5 daily pryers as well as the times for feasting during the ramadhan are according to sunrise and sunset. My question : How do a muslim may deterine the appropriate times for the prayers and begin feasting if he/she lives near the artic circle where nights and days can be quite long depending of the season. My thanks for your answer and continue your work. It helps me understand a few things about islam as well as understand what our local staff were talking about.,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you for this question and we appreciate your interest in the prayer times in Islam. In answer to your question, those who live close to the Arctic Circle, where they have continual night or continual day for several months, should look to the closest city to them where night and day are distinct in each twenty-four hour period, then they should do the five daily prayers based on the timing in that city. Your interest in the matter and your keenness to ask questions and find out gives us the hope that you will embrace this religion and practise its rituals. We wish you well and hope for guidance for you."
449,Should a new Muslim be taught all the rulings in one go?,"Question Should the new Muslim who has recently embraced Islam be taught all the rulings and laws of Islam in one go, or in stages? Should he start with the basic beliefs or the basic rulings with the obligatory duties and prohibitions?.","Praise be to Allah.The answer to this question is to see what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did when he sent out daa‘iyahs to call people to Islam. He (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent the daa‘iyahs to call the people to Islam, and he taught them to start first of all with Tawheed or the Oneness of Allah, then the prayer, then zakaah, then fasting, then Hajj when the time for it came. He sent Mu‘aadh to Yemen and told him to call them first of all to Tawheed, belief in the Oneness of Allah. If they responded to that, then he was to call them to pray. If they responded to that, then he was to call them to give zakaah. He did not mention fasting and Hajj because when he sent Mu‘aadh, it was not the time for these acts of worship, as he sent him in Rabee‘ al-Awwal of 10 AH. There was still some time to go before Hajj, and also fasting. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his wisdom did not want to spring all the rulings of Islam at once on those who were being called to the faith. This is part of the wisdom mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلىالله عليه وسلم) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom” [al-Nahl 16:125]. But should one start, straight after a person has entered Islam, with rulings on minor issues such as the beard, isbaal (letting the hem of one’s clothes come below the ankle) and so on? This should be based on what is referred to above, that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). So he should start first of all with the basics of Islam, until Islam is settled in his heart and he is at ease in his new faith. At that point we may teach him other matters, starting with the most important, then the next most important and so on. This is the way of Allah with regard to both shar‘i rulings and laws of nature. Look how the foetus begins to grow bit by bit, and the four seasons change bit by bit, and the sun rises and sets similarly. If we were to teach all the rulings and so on all at once, it would take a long time and it may put him off the religion of Islam. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) Al-Ijaabaat ‘ala As’ilat al-Jaaliyaat, 1/27-30"
450,What are the means of remembering adhkaar and not forgetting them?,Question What are the ways in which a person can avoid forgetting the adhkaar for morning and evening; what are your suggestions? We are also very keen to learn the names of some resources on adhkaar.,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Remembrance of Allaah (dhikr) is one of the greatest acts of worship and best acts of obedience. It is a means of rising in status. Allaah has not set any limit for remembrance of Him, rather He has enjoined remembering Him a great deal. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and remember Allaah much, that you may be successful” [al-Jumu’ah 62:10] “Verily, the Muslims (those who submit to Allaah in Islam) men and women, the believers men and women (who believe in Islamic Monotheism), the men and the women who are obedient (to Allaah), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the duties which Allaah has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allaah has forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord ___Allaah), the men and the women who give Sadaqaat (i.e. Zakaah and alms), the men and the women who observe Sawm (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadân, and the optional Nawafil fasting), the men and the women who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the women who remember Allaah much with their hearts and tongues. Allaah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)” [al-Ahzaab 33:35] In the Qur’aan, Allaah does not enjoin doing any act of worship a great deal, except remembrance of Allaah (dhikr). In the remembrance of Allaah hearts find rest. “Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allaah verily, in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest” [al-Ra’d 13:28] In order to find out the means that help one to remember the adhkaar for the morning and evening, it is essential, first of all, to find out the causes of forgetting and neglecting them, then deal with these causes. 1.Carelessness in memorizing these adhkaar and relying on booklets to recite them. 2.Being distracted by worldly matters at the expense of time for the morning and evening adhkaar. 3.Not knowing the worldly benefits of these adhkaar, such as protection for the one who recites them, opening the door to provision and warding off evil for the one who recites them, and the benefits in the Hereafter, such as a reward equivalent to that of freeing a slave, making the Balance weigh heavily, and earning the good pleasure of Allaah, may He be exalted 4.Committing many sins, which affects the person’s heart and prevents him from remembering Allaah. 5.Ignorance of the time for the morning and evening adhkaar, so he thinks that the time for the morning adhkaar ends with Fajr prayer, for example, and the time for the evening adhkaar ends with ‘Asr prayer, for example. In fact the time for the morning adhkaar lasts until after sunrise, and the time for the evening adhkaar lasts until after sunset. For more information please see question no. 22765. The way to deal with these causes is as follows: 1.Try to memorize most of these adhkaar so that you will be able to recite them in the car or on the way to work or school, without needing the book. 2.Pondering the meanings of these adhkaar that are prescribed in Islam, because many people recite these adhkaar without understanding the meanings, which weakens or cancels out their effect on reforming the heart. 3.Setting aside a specific time in the morning and evening for reciting these adhkaar and sticking to it, and ignoring everything that may distract you from that. 4.Do not delay reciting these adhkaar when you remember to do so, because putting off such things may lead to forgetting them. 5.Finding out what has been narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah of the great rewards in this world and in the Hereafter for the one who remembers Allaah. Undoubtedly this will encourage you to remember them and not neglect them. 6.Keep away from sins so that your heart will remain sound and sincere, longing to remember Allaah. 7.Strive to take a gradual approach in learning these adhkaar. Do not set yourself a program of reciting everything that is narrated in the book of adhkaar, so that you will not make things too difficult for yourself, which may lead you to give up. Rather you should recite a small portion so that you can taste the sweetness of dhikr, and increase it gradually. 8.Read the biographies of worshippers who strove hard in the remembrance of Allaah, so that it will encourage you to follow their example and strive as they strove. 9.Urge your wife, children and family to remind one another of these adhkaar, for the believer gains great support through his brothers. 10.Seek righteous friends who will help you to remember Allaah and remind you of adhkaar and acts of worship. Thirdly: Book which speak of these adhkaar and their virtues include the following: 1.al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi 2.al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Ibn Taymiyah, annoted by al-Albaani. 3.al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah 4.Tuhfat al-Dhaakireen by al-Shawkaani 5.Tuhfat al-Akhyaar by Shaykh Ibn Baaz 6.Fiqh al-Ad’iyah wa’l-Adhkaar by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ibn ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad 7.al-Ma’thooraat min al-Adhkaar wa’l-Da’waat by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Qusayr 8.Saheeh al-Adhkaar wa’l-Du’aa al-Mustajaab by Shaykh Mustafa al-‘Adawi And Allaah knows best."
451,How to deal with a misbehaving mother,"Question first i wish to state that this q&a is very beneficial to the ummah mash'Allah and we hope you and your helpers will receive the best reward in this world and the next. my question is on behalf of a muslim young man. he is mash'Allah a sincere seeming and knowledgeable muslim who follows islam to the best of his ability and upon the correct aqeedah. he lives alone with his divorced mother whose does not follow islam thoroughly and engages in very unislamic activities sometimes. i know both him and his mother and they are very close and very kind but i see that the son i sometimes put in situations that are extremely stressful for him and i cannot advise him properly. a few examples of these situations include the mother going out of the house in shorts and the son hating this shame but walking with her for fear that she will be accosted, or the mother being overly freindly with male acquaintances in the western manner, or going to dinner and sitting at a table where alcohol is being consumed though the mother does not consume it. there are various other types of scenarios that try this brother such as his mothers' friends advocating every kind of bidah. he does say what is wrong and try to give dawah to his mother but it is usually ignored as ""extremism"" or ""from the stone age"". please advise, my freind is confided in me only that he feels like a dirty ""dayouth"" and wants to know if staying with his mother is the correct thing given such behavior on her part. he errs on the side of staying with his mother even when she is adamant about wearing unislamic clothing for fear of her being molested be some stranger. also he did not tell me of these things and reveal his families faults, rather it is evident for those arouind to see as well as for me to see as his friend. please help and mat Allah ta'Aalaa reward you with the good.","Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that the story you have told us is very sad and moving, especially when we see someone suffering because the person who is closest to him is lacking in terms of religion. But ‘Allaah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs for us.’ [Aal- ‘Imraan 3:173 – interpretation of the meaning] ‘Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ [al-Baqarah 2:156 – interpretation of the meaning]. This brother should remember that honouring one’s parents is one of the most important duties that human beings have towards one another, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks to Me and to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly…” [Luqmaan 31:14-15]. These mushrik parents were doing their utmost to make their son associate partners with Allaah, yet in spite of that Allaah commanded the son to maintain a relationship with them and behave kindly with them in this world. So you are also obliged to treat your mother well, advise her to give up her bad behaviour, explain to her how sinful her deeds are and what punishment awaits her if she does not stop. If she responds, then praise be to Allaah. If she does not, then keep away from her in a good way; do not mix with her in ways that will adversely affect your religion, but do not upset her either. Behave with her in the world kindly, and continue to advise her from time to time. Your keeping away from her will not be a sin, if you do it for the sake of Allaah and in opposition to something wrong. (See the response of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen in Fataawaa Islamiyyah, 4/196; al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah fi Fataawaa Islamiyyah (Standing Committee on Islamic Fatwas), 4/204; Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen in Fataawaa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/957) In conclusion therefore, if your staying with her will benefit her by increasing her religious commitment and eemaan, her adherence to Islamic duties and her avoidance of haraam deeds – or at least reduce her involvement in such activities – because she feels that she is being watched, for example, or because this will keep bad people away from her, and this will not cause you any harm at the same time, then stay with her in the hope of earning reward for whatever efforts you make, and Allaah will reward you for your patience. If you have already tried your utmost, to no avail, and have found that you are not making progress in any of the ways referred to above, and staying with her will have an adverse effect on your own religious commitment or reputation, then there is no sin on you if you keep away from her, as stated above, so long as you continue to check on her from time to time, to pay attention to her needs and to advise her. We ask Allaah to bless you with patience and reward you for your efforts, for He is the best of supporters and helpers."
452,Ruling on establishing a newspaper for advertising,"Question What is the ruling on making a newspaper just for trade advertisements, such as seeking work, selling apartments, selling cars, advertising some companies etc, and publishing commercial adverts for some companies? If it is permissible, what are the shar’i guidelines that must be adhered to with regard to choosing companies and types of advertisement? And the guidelines on taking money from companies or from those who want to put ads in the paper? Please note that I will be in charge of it along with some of my friends, so that we will be able to choose which adverts are put in the paper.","Praise be to Allah. Things that go against sharee’ah are common in many newspapers and magazines, both daily and weekly. We have explained some of these haraam things, and the ruling on working for those newspapers, and the ruling on selling them in the answers to questions no. 89737 and 82704. With regard to publishing a newspaper that is just for advertising, the basic principle is that publishing and distributing it is permissible, but there are conditions and guidelines attached to this permissibility which may be summed up as avoiding adverts that go against Islam. That includes: 1- Avoiding adverts for tourist resorts and immoral places i.e., adverts for tourist resorts where there are haraam things such as alcohol, mixing and uncovering of ‘awrahs in beaches and in amusement parks, all of which comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression, and liking to spread immorality. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2] “Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allaah knows and you know not” [al-Noor 24:19] 2- Avoiding adverts for companies that deal in riba (usury), gambling and haraam earnings, such as adverts for riba-based banks, insurance companies and manufacturers and stores that sell haraam things. 3- Avoiding announcements of innovated festivals or those that imitate the kuffaar, such as announcements about celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday (Mawlid) or Laylat al-Nusf min Sha’baan (the 15th of Sha’baan) or announcements of people’s birthdays. 4- Avoiding using pictures of women or hand-drawn pictures of animate beings. 5- Avoiding advertisements for conferences where debates are that go against Islam or are opposed to it. 6- Avoiding announcements that praise the dead, especially if they were not Muslim. There follow some fatwas about advertising some of these haraam things: 1 – The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: There are some people who distribute advertisements door-to-door, and in these adverts every store has its own page, so there are adverts for companies that sell shoes and furniture, but there are some adverts for stores that sell food, and these adverts show most of what they sell. So next to the sugar and rice they show alcohol, or they show beef, lamb and pork. What is the ruling on delivering these adverts? Some people deliver the adverts that include food, but they throw away the ones that include alcohol and pork without the advertiser knowing about it, then they charge them for having delivered them. What is the ruling on that money? Some of the scholars in Europe say that alcohol and pork are permissible in those people’s religion. Does that mean that we can work in stores selling alcohol and pork? What is your response to this idea? They replied: It is haraam for the Muslims to sell alcohol and pork and it is not permissible for them to cooperate with others in distributing or marketing haraam things or promoting or advertising them, or delivering adverts for them, because that is cooperating in sin and transgression, which Allaah has forbidden in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment” [al-Maa’idah 5:2] The money that a person gets in return for posting adverts for haraam things is not permissible, even if he throws the haraam adverts away and does not deliver them, the money is still not permissible for him, because that is consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (14/429, 430) 2 – The Scholars of the Standing Committee were also asked: There is a man who is working as a journalist in a newspaper in Egypt and he writes reports and he writes adverts, for which he is paid. The newspaper is full of material that opposes Allaah and His Messenger. With regard to the adverts, he plays the role of an intermediary between the newspaper and the public. He goes to people (such as businessmen) and encourages them to place ads, and they pay the fee for these ads without any pressure, so that the names of their businesses will be published in the newspaper. This is a kind of advertising, but they are supporting falsehood. The one who brings such business gets a set share of the advertising fee and gets money for it. Is this money halaal or haraam? If this money is haraam, is it permissible for me and the rest of my siblings to eat from it as the son of this man? Please note that he has other income from a government job. And is the money that he gets from his government job permissible? They replied: Firstly: Working to serve those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger is not permissible, because it is cooperating with them in sin and transgression, which Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, has forbidden to His slaves as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah” [al-Maa’idah 5:2] Secondly: Whatever money he has earned from cooperating with them in their evil is haraam. Thirdly: If your father’s wealth that he got from working with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger is distinct from that which he has earned from other jobs or in other permissible ways, then it is not permissible for you and your siblings to eat from it. But if it is not distinct, then it is permissible for you to eat from it according to the correct scholarly view, but it is better to avoid doing so in order to be on the safe side, especially if the haraam portion is greater.

Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (15/102, 103) 3 –Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: With regard to condolences in the newspapers, notices of thanks for condolences and announcements of deaths, what is the Islamic view on these? He replied: If an announcement of a person’s death is made in the newspaper for a valid purpose, which is so that the people will know of his death so that they can attend the funeral prayer and accompany the bier and say du’aa’ for him, and so that those who were owed anything by the deceased may ask for it or waive it, there is nothing wrong with announcements made for these purposes. But there should be no exaggeration in the manner in which the announcement is done, such as taking up an entire page of the newspaper, because that costs a lot of money and there is no need for that. It is also not permissible to write the verse which many people customarily write when announcing a death: “(It will be said to the pious — believers of Islamic Monotheism): ‘O (you) the one in (complete) rest and satisfaction! 28. ‘Come back to your Lord, __ well‑pleased (yourself) and well‑pleasing (unto Him)! 29. ‘Enter you then among My (honoured) slaves, 30. ‘And enter you My Paradise!’” [al-Fajr 89:27-30] because this is praising the deceased and stating that he is one of the people of Paradise, and that is not permissible, because it is speaking about Allaah (without knowledge) and claiming to have knowledge of the unseen. It cannot be stated that any specific person is in Paradise without evidence from the Qur’aan or Sunnah. Rather we should hope for good for the believer but we cannot state that for certain. End quote. Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan (2/159). Conclusion: You should avoid advertisements for haraam things and anything that goes against sharee’ah. Everything else is permissible for you to advertise. As for taking money from companies and individuals who want to advertise in your paper, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as the advert does not include anything haraam and the contract is done with mutual consent. And Allaah knows best."
453,Is it obligatory to feed sixty poor persons in one go? Can he feed his family with what he offers as expiation (kafaarah)?,"Question I deliberately broke the fast one day in Ramadan and I want to feed sixty poor persons. My question is: Is it stipulated to feed them in one go or can I feed four poor persons each day, for example, or three poor persons? Is it permissible for me to feed poor persons if they are members of my family, such as my father, mother and siblings?.","Praise be to Allah.If a person breaks the fast in Ramadan by doing something other than having intercourse, he does not have to offer expiation, according to the correct view. Rather what he has to do is repent and make up the day on which the fast was broken. If he broke the fast by having intercourse, then he has to repent and make up that day, and the expiation for that is freeing a believing slave. If that is not possible, then he should fast for two consecutive months. If he is not able to do that, then he should feed sixty poor persons. If he decides to feed poor people because he is unable to do the first two options, namely freeing a slave or fasting for two months, it is permissible to give the food to the poor in one go, or he may give it in stages, according to what he is able to do. But it is essential to cover the reuired number of poor persons. And it is not permissible to give the food offered as an expiation to one's ascendants (fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers) or to one's descendants (children and grandchildren, both male and female). And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah sent blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. End quote.

He should not marry his daughter to him unless he has explained his situation and said, “I have such and such a disease.” Then if they agree to that, then that is fine, otherwise the marriage should not proceed, because if he conceals the matter from them he may have cheated them and deceived them, and the woman may pass the disease to her husband, or the husband may pass it to his wife, and to their children after that. But if she accepts you and agrees, and accepts the will and decree of Allaah, then that is OK"
455,"‘Aashoora’ in Islam and previous religions, and refutation of the Raafidi claim that it is an innovation introduced by the Umayyads","Question Is the day of 'Ashura on which we fast not the correct day? Because I read that the correct day is the tenth day of the month of Tishrei in the Hebrew calendar, and that the Umayyad caliphs are the ones who changed it to the tenth day of the month of Muharram. Tishrei is the first month of the Jewish calendar.","Praise be to Allah.-1- The fast of ‘Aashoora’, which we observe on the tenth day of the month of Muharram, is the day on which Allah, may He be exalted, saved Moosa (peace be upon him), and it is the day on which some of the Jews in Madinah fasted because of that. It is also the day on which Allah commanded the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to fast at first, then the obligation to do so was abrogated when fasting Ramadan was made obligatory, and fasting ‘Aashoora’ became mustahabb (encouraged but not obligatory). The claim that some of the Umayyad caliphs are the ones who put this day in Muharram is a Raafidi claim. It is one of the many lies on which their religion is based and it is part of their belief to attribute all kinds of evil to the Umayyad caliphs and their era. If the Umayyads had wanted to fabricate false hadiths and attribute them to Islam, they would have fabricated hadiths that made the day of ‘Aashoora’ an Eid or festival! and not a day of fasting on which a person refrains from eating, drinking and sex. Fasting is an act of worship in which one refrains from permissible things, and Eid is a celebration in which one partakes of those things. -2- There is no doubt that the arrival of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Madinah, when he migrated, occurred in Rabee‘ al-Awwal, not in Muharram. He saw some of the Jews fasting, and when he asked them about this fast of theirs, they said: It is the day on which Allah saved Moosa and those who were with him from drowning, so we fast on this day in gratitude to Allah. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, he found them fasting on one day, i.e., ‘Aashoora’. They said: This is a great day; it is the day on which Allah saved Moosa and drowned the people of Pharaoh, so Moosa fasted in gratitude to Allah. He (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) said: “I am closer to Moosa than they are.” So he fasted on that day and issued instructions to fast on that day. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3216 When he saw the Jews doing that, was it when he first came to Madinah in Rabee‘ al-Awwal, or was it later on, in the month of Muharram? There are two scholarly views; the more correct view is that his seeing them, that discussion and that command to fast occurred in Muharram, i.e., in the second year after he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) arrived in Madinah, and from that we may conclude that the Jews followed the lunar calendar in commemorating that day. Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Some people were confused by this and said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah in the month of Rabee‘ al-Awwal, so how come Ibn ‘Abbas said that when he came to Madinah, he found the Jews fasting on the day of ‘Aashoora’? He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the first issue, which is that when he came to Madinah, he found them fasting on the day of ‘Aashoora’, this does not indicate that on the day of his arrival he found them observing that fast. He arrived on a Monday, the twelfth of Rabee‘ al-Awwal, but the first he knew of that was in the second year after his arrival in Madinah, and it did not happen when he was in Makkah. This is if the people of the Book worked out the date for this fast according to the lunar calendar. Zaad al-Ma‘aad fi Hadiy Khayr al-‘Ibaad, 2/66 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The apparent meaning of the report was problematic to some people, because it appears to mean that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) arrived in Madinah, he found the Jews fasting the day of ‘Aashoora’, but he arrived in Madinah in Rabee‘ al-Awwal. The answer to that is that what is meant is that his first knowing of that and asking about it happened after he came to Madinah; he had no knowledge of that before he came there. What the hadith implies is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and stayed until the day of ‘Aashoora’, when he found the Jews fasting on that day. Fath al-Baari, 4/247 -3- Was the calendar that the Jews used for that fast of theirs based on lunar or solar months? If we say that it was based on lunar months, as stated above, then there is no problem, because the tenth of Muharram does not change every year. But if we say that it was based on solar months, then there is a problem, because this day will change every year (in relation to the lunar calendar) and will not always coincide with the tenth day of Muharram. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned this difference of opinion, and explained that he was of the view that their calendar was based on the solar months, so when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw the Jews fasting on that day, it was in Rabee‘ al-Awwal when he first came to Madinah, and the date based on the solar calendar coincided with his arrival. With regard to the real day on which Allah saved Moosa, it was the tenth of Muharram, but because they followed a solar calendar, they got the day wrong. Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If they followed the solar calendar, there is no confusion about the meaning of the hadith, and the day on which Allah saved Moosa was the day of 'Ashura in Muharram. Thus the people of the Book worked it out according to a solar calendar, and that coincided with the Prophet’s arrival in Madinah in Rabee‘ al-Awwal. The fast observed by the people of the Book was worked out according to a solar calendar, whereas the Muslims’ fast is according to the lunar calendar, as is their pilgrimage and all important occasions that are obligatory or recommended. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “We are closer to Moosa than you.” Thus it becomes clear that the Muslims should have a greater reason to venerate that day and work out when it is, and that they (the Jews) got it wrong, because they were using a solar calendar, as the Christians got it wrong with regard to their fast, when they put it in a particular season of the year, with the result that it could coincide with any lunar month. Zaad al-Ma‘aad fi Hadiy Khayr al-‘Ibaad, 2/69, 70 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr mentioned this possible interpretation, and refuted it, and he refuted Ibn al-Qayyim’s favouring of this view. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Some of the later scholars said: It may be that their fast was worked out according to the solar calendar, which does not rule out the possibility of 'Ashura occurring in Rabee‘ al-Awwal, which would resolve the problem (of understanding the hadith) altogether. This was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim in al-Hadiy, where he said: The fast observed by the people of the Book was worked out according to a solar calendar. But I say: What he claimed of the problem being resolved is strange, because it leads to another problem, which is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the Muslims to fast 'Ashura according to the lunar calendar, and it is known how the Muslims fasted 'Ashura in all eras: it was in Muharram and not in any other month. Yes, I found a report in at-Tabaraani with a jayyid isnaad from Zayd ibn Thaabit who said: The day of 'Ashura is not the day people say it is; rather it is the day on which the cover of the Ka‘bah replaced and the Abyssinians play with swords and other tools of war, and was not fixed in one (lunar) month. The people used to go to So and so, the Jew, and ask him when it was; when he died they came to Zayd ibn Thaabit and asked him. Based on this, the way to reconcile the reports is to say that it was originally like that (based on a solar calendar), then when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed the Muslims to fast 'Ashura, he based it on the shar‘i ruling, which is to base it on the lunar calendar, and the Muslims followed that. But with regard to the claim that the people of the Book based their fast on a solar calendar, that is subject to further discussion. The Jews base their fast on a lunar calendar, and this is what we have seen them do. It may be that among them were some who followed a solar calendar, but there are none who do that now, just as those of whom Allah has told us that they said that ‘Uzayr was a son of God no longer exist. Exalted be Allah far above that. Fath al-Baari, 7/267; see also 4/247 Elsewhere in Fath al-Baari, al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar says, commenting on the report of at-Tabaraani: I came across something similar in al-Athaar al-Qadeemah by Abu’r-Rayhaan al-Bayrooni, and what he said, in brief, was: the ignorant among the Jews base their fasts and festivals on astronomical calculations, so their year is solar, not lunar. I say: Hence they need someone who has knowledge of such calculations, so that they can rely on him for that purpose. Fath al-Baari, 4/247, 248 With regard to the report of Zayd ibn Thaabit that was mentioned by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him), and to which he responded, al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) has discussed its isnaad and text. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This suggests that 'Ashura is not in Muharram; rather its date is worked out according to the solar calendar, as the people of the Book do, and this is contrary to the practice of the Muslims in earlier times. Ibn Abi’z-Zinnaad is not to be relied on in reports that are narrated only by him. He regarded the entire hadith as being from Zayd ibn Thaabit, and the latter part of it is not fit to be the words of Zayd, so perhaps that is the words of another narrator. And Allah knows best. Lataa’if al-Ma‘aarif, p. 53 -4- One may ask: how come the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) believe what the Jews said about the day of 'Ashura being the day on which Moosa and those who were with him were saved? This is what the Raafidis ask with evil ulterior motives, so as to cast aspersions on the hadiths which encourage fasting on the day of 'Ashura, and so as to support their claim that this is one of the innovations introduced by the Umayyads! Al-Maaziri (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this issue and the response to it: What the Jews say is not to be accepted (and taken as true), so it may be that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) received revelation that confirmed what they said, or that he heard about that from many different sources, so that he concluded that it was true. End quote. This was quoted by an-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim, 8/11 Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Even though this fast was not originally intended to do the same as the people of the Book, his saying, “We are closer to Moosa than you” is a confirmation of the prescription to observe this the fast, and explaining to the Jews that what you do of expressing love for Moosa, we do too, and we are closer to Moosa than you. Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, p. 174 -5- It should be noted that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) liked to do the same as the people of the Book in matters concerning which he had not received any (divine) instructions; this included the fast of 'Ashura. It was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to let his hair fall over his foreheads; the mushrikeen used to part their hair and the people of the Book used to let their hair fall over their foreheads, and the Prophet (sa) liked to do the same as the people of the Book in matters concerning which he had not received any (divine) instructions. Then (later on) the Prophet (sa) parted his hair. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3728 It is a sign of Imam al-Bukhaari’s understanding of the religion that he narrated this hadith after the two hadiths of Abu Moosa and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that speak of the fast of 'Ashura. Abu’l-‘Abbas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The fact that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted it ('Ashura) may have come under the heading of doing the same as them (the people of the Book) in that regard, because that was a good deed. It may be said that Allah, may He be exalted, gave him permission to fast on that day, then when he came to Madinah, he found the Jews fasting on that day, so he asked them about what motivated them to observe that fast. They told him what Ibn ‘Abbas mentioned, that it was a great day, on which Allah saved Moosa and his people, and drowned Pharaoh and his people, so Moosa fasted that day in gratitude, so we fast it too. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “We have more right and are closer to Moosa than you.” So at that time he fasted this day in Madinah and issued instructions to fast on that day, i.e., he made it obligatory to fast it and confirmed his instructions, to such an extent that they would make little children fast as well. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) adhered to that, as did his Companions, until the month of Ramadan was made obligatory and fasting the day of 'Ashura was abrogated. At that time he said: “Allah has not prescribed fasting this day for you.” Then he gave them the choice between fasting it or not fasting it, but the virtue attached to it remained in place, because he said “However I am fasting,” as it says in the hadith of Mu‘aawiyah. Based on that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not fast the day of 'Ashura in emulation of the Jews, because he used to fast it before he came to them and before he knew anything about them; rather what happened was that he made it obligatory, in hope of softening the Jews’ hearts and win them over to Islam, just as was the reason for facing towards their qiblah. That period was the time when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) liked to do the same as the people of the Book in matters that he had not been forbidden to do so. Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhees Kitaab Muslim, 3/191-192 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whatever the case, he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not fast it in emulation of them – i.e., the Jews – because he used to fast it before that, and that was at the time when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) liked to do the same as the people of the Book in matters that he had not been forbidden to do so. Fath al-Baari, 4/248 -6- We have seen above from the comments of the scholars that which indicates that the day of 'Ashura was known to Quraysh and to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Makkah, and they used to venerate it and indeed fast it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted it with them, and on that day they used to put the new cover on the Ka‘bah. So how can anyone, after all this, falsely claim that 'Ashura is an Umayyad innovation at the time when it is clearly mentioned in the proven, saheeh hadiths?! It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Quraysh used to fast on 'Ashura during the Jaahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to fast on (that day) too. When he migrated to Madinah, he fasted this day and ordered that this fast be observed. When the month of Ramadaan was enjoined, he said: “Whoever wishes may fast on (this day) and whoever wishes may forsake it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1794); Muslim (1125). ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to fast on the day of 'Ashura, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Muslims fasted it before Ramadaan was made obligatory. When the month of Ramadaan was made obligatory, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “ 'Ashura is one of the days of Allah, so whoever wishes may fast it and whoever wishes may omit it.” Narrated by Muslim (1126). We have quoted the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar here so as to refute the Raafidis and those who followed them in their ignorance, who claim that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was the only one who narrated the report about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasting 'Ashura in Makkah. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a report similar to that of ‘Aa’ishah concerning this matter. It was also narrated by ‘Ubaydullah ibn ‘Umar and Ayyoob, from Naafi‘, from Ibn ‘Umar that he said concerning the fast of 'Ashura: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) fasted it and instructed (the people) to fast it. At-Tamheed lima fi’l-Muwatta’ min al-Ma‘aani wa’l-Asaaneed, 7/207 An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What we conclude from these hadiths is that during the Jaahiliyyah, the kuffaar of Quraysh and others, and the Jews, fasted on the day of 'Ashura. Islam confirmed fasting on this day, then the ruling on fasting it became less emphatic. Sharh Muslim, 8/9, 10 Abu’l-‘Abbas al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The words of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her): “Quryash used to fast 'Ashura during the Jaahiliyyah,” indicate that fasting on this day was known to them to be prescribed and they were aware of its virtue. Perhaps they fasted on that day on the grounds that it was part of what was prescribed to Ibraaheem and Ismaa‘eel (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them), because they claimed to be following them and they attributed many of the rulings of Hajj and so on to them. Al-Mufhim lima Ashkala min Talkhees Kitaab Muslim, 3/190, 191 For more information on the reasons why Quraysh fasted on that day, please see al-Mufassal fi Tareekh al-‘Arab qabl al-Islam, 11/339, 340 -7- Finally, what we have mentioned from the saheeh Sunnah about the virtues of 'Ashura, and the fact that fasting it expiates for the sins of a year, and that its date is fixed, on the tenth of Muharram – all of that is not unique to Ahl as-Sunnah. Rather it is also mentioned in the main reference book of the Raafidis! So how can this be reconciled with their claims that what we have are israa’eeliyyat (stories from Jewish sources), that were taken from the Jews or invented by the Umayyads?? (i) It was narrated from Abu ‘Abdullah (peace be upon him) from his father that ‘Ali (peace be upon him) said: Fast 'Ashura in this manner, on the ninth and the tenth, for it expiates the sins of a year. Narrated by at-Toosi in Tahdheeb al-Ahkaam, 4/299; al-Istibsaar, 2/134; by al-Fayd al-Kaashaani in al-Waafi, 7/13; by al-Hurr al-‘Aamili in Wasaa’il ash-Shi‘ah, 7/337; by al-Buroojardi in Jaami‘ Ahaadeeth ash-Shi‘ah, 9/474, 475. (ii) It was narrated from Abu’l-Hasan (peace be upon him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) fasted the day of 'Ashura. Tahdheeb al-Ahkaam, 4/39; al-Istibsaar, 2/134; al-Waafi, 7/13; Wasaa’il ash-Shi‘ah, 7/337; also in Jaami‘ Ahaadeeth ash-Shi‘ah, 9/475 (iii) It was narrated from Ja‘far, from his father (peace be upon him) that he said: Fasting the day of 'Ashura is an expiation for a year. Tahdheeb al-Ahkaam,4/300; al-Istibsaar, 2/134; Jaami‘ Ahaadeeth ash-Shi‘ah, 9/475; al-Hadaa’iq an-Naadirah, 13/371; al-Waafi by al-Kaashaani,7/13; al-Hurr al-‘Aamili in Wasaa’il ash-Shi‘ah, 7/337 (iv) It was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Fast the day of 'Ashura, the ninth and the tenth to be on the safe side, because that is expiation for the past year. If one of you did not know about it before he ate, then let him fast for the rest of the day. This report was narrated by the Shi‘i hadith scholar Husayn an-Noori at-Tabrusi in Mustadrak al-Wasaa’il, 1/594; and by al-Buroojardi in Ahaadeeth ash-Shi‘ah, 9/475. (v) It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When you see the new moon of Muharram, then count (the days), and when the ninth day comes, then fast. I – that is, the narrator – said: Is that how Muhammad (peace be upon him and his family) used to fast? He said: Yes. This report was narrated by the Shi‘i Radiy ad-Deen Abu’l-Qaasim ‘Ali ibn Moosa ibn Ja‘far ibn Tawoos in his book Iqbaal al-A‘maal, p. 554; and by al-Hurr al-‘Aamili in Wasaa’il ash-Shi‘ah, 7/347; and by an-Noori at-Tabrusi in Mustadrak al-Wasaa’il, 1/594; and in Jaami‘ Ahaadeeth ash-Shi‘ah, 9/475. We have quoted these reports and their sources from the book Man qatala al-Husayn (radiy Allah ‘andhu)? by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez. And Allah knows best."
456,Arranging the rows during prayer,"Question Many people do not know that it is from the sunnah to stand feet to feet and so during a jamaa'h, they leave a small gap in between. To what extent are we obliged to try and fill the gap by spreading our feet further apart? If the line is not straight, do we align ouselves to the person on our right, or the one on the left?.","Praise be to Allah. It is obligatory for the Muslims to make their rows straight and compact and to close the gaps between them. That is done by standing shoulder-to-shoulder and foot-to-foot. It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Make your rows straight for I can see you behind my back.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 686; Muslim, 425. It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Make your rows straight, stand shoulder to shoulder and close the gaps, and do not resist your brothers’ hands. Do not leave any gaps for the Shaytaan. Whoever complete a row, Allaah will reward him, and whoever breaksa row, Allaah will forsake him. Abu Dawood said: What is meant by “Do not resist your brothers’ hands” is that a man should be easy-going if his brother pushes him forwards or backwards to make the row straight. (‘Awn al-Ma’bood). Narrated by Abu Dawood, 666; al-Nasaa’i, 819. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 620. It was narrated that al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned to face the people and said, ‘Straighten your rows,’ three times, ‘for by Allaah either you straighten your rows or Allaah will create division among your hearts.’ And I saw men standing shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee, ankle to ankle.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 662; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 616. Should a man look to his right or his left so that he can make the row straight? The Sunnah is for the imam to stand in the front, in line with in the middle of the row, then the rows should start from behind the imam, not from the right hand side of the mosque or the left, as some people do. Rather they should start from behind the imam, then the row should be completed to both the right and the left, so as to follow the Sunnah of having the imam in the middle. Based on this, then whoever is in the right half of the row should look to his left and align himself with whoever is on his left and whoever is in the left half should look to his right and align himself with whoever is on his right. With regard to the gaps between the feet, the worshipper should stand in a moderate fashion, neither standing with his feet together nor making them too far apart, because the further apart he makes them, the further his shoulders will be from his neighbour’s shoulders. Making the rows straight and compact is achieved by standing foot-to-foot and shoulder-to-shoulder. Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said: One of the new things that we see some people doing, with no evidence in sharee’ah, is that in prayer they try to align themselves with a person on the right if they are on the right hand side of the row, or to align themselves with a person on their left if they are on the left hand side of the row, and they turn their feet inward so that their ankles are touching the ankles of the people next to them. This is something for which there is no basis in sharee’ah and it is going to the extreme in implementing the Sunnah. This is wrong on two counts. The alignment of the row should begin from where the imam is standing. Whoever is on the right of the row should align himself by looking at those who are to his left (i.e., closer to the imam). Thus the line will be straightened and the gaps will be filled. Alignment is done by lining up necks, shoulders and ankles, and by completing the front rows. But to try to spread the legs wide and turn the feet inward so that one's ankles touch one’s neighbours’ ankles is an obvious mistake and an exaggeration, and a new interpretation which is indicative of going to extremes in trying to apply the Sunnah. It causes annoyance and is not prescribed in sharee’ah, and it widens the gaps between people standing in prayer. That becomes apparent when the people prostrate, and when they stand up again they become distracted in trying to fill the gaps and turning their feet to make their ankles touch their neighbours’ ankles, which makes them miss out on what they should be doing, which is to make the toes point in the direction of the qiblah. Doing that is like competing with one’s neighbour and trying to take his place. All of that is not prescribed in sharee’ah. Laa jadeed fi Ahkaam al-Salaah, 12. 13."
457,Questions about an imam,"Question Q#1.In our company camp, there is a Imam, who is leading every prayer, he is from ....... about his qira'ath, like he giving ""madd"" upon every kalima, reciting like song. we asked him which type of qira'ath is this? He is saying that his ustad have teached him like this. sometime we can't pray behind him because his sound will arise with different tune. Kindly we want know, is allowed to recite such type of tune and very high sound? what is the rule of reciting qur'an in the obligatory prayer (Fajr, Magrib & Esha)? Q#2. After prayer he will put his hand (palm) on his forehead and saying ""ya hayyun, ya qayyoom"" for seven time. we asked him ""why are you doing this?"" he answered: Scholars said that our brain become will be braight, if you do this after every obligatory prayer and he told us it is in the Sahih Muslim also. but we didn't find that. Please, for the sake of Allah, answer to us for the above question to correct our deeds on right path, if he is doing wrong, how we can correct him? he never agree anything, because he is saying what I am doing it is correct according to Islam. so, we can't say anything against him.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Making one’s voice beautiful when reciting Qur’aan is something good and there is nothing wrong with it; rather this is part of the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was narrated that al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reciting Wa’l-teeni wa’l-zaytoon in ‘Isha prayer, and I never heard anyone with a more beautiful voice (or recitation) than his.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 735; Muslim, 464 And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) praised the recitation of Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari, who had a melodious voice. But the kind of making the voice beautiful which is encouraged should not distort the meaning of the words and it should not resemble the way that the evildoers sing songs. It was narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu Moosa, “If only you had seen me when I was listening to you last night, you have been given a beautiful voice like that of Dawood.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4761; Muslim, 793; this version narrated by Muslim Al-Nawawi said: Al-Qaadi said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is mustahabb to make one's voice beautiful when reciting Qur’aan and to recite properly (tarteel). Abu ‘Ubayd said: The ahaadeeth narrated concerning that are to be understood as meaning that it should be done with solemnity and feeling. He said, But they differed with regard to reciting it with a tune. Maalik and the majority regarded that as makrooh because that is contrary to the purpose for which the Qur’aan was revealed, whichis to be recited with humility and understanding. Abu Haneefah and a group among the Salaf regarded it as permissible because of the ahaadeeth and because that is a means of softening people’s hearts, provoking fear and making people receptive towards listening to it. I say: al-Shaafa’i said in one place, I dislike reciting Qur’aan with a tune; and elsewhere he said, I do not dislike it. Our companions said: there is no contradiction in this case, rather it has to do with two different situations. When he said that he disliked it, he meant if it was excessively elongated and the meanings of the words were changed by adding or taking away or elongating something that is not to be elongated, etc.; and when he said that it was permissible, he meant if it does not change the meaning of the words. And Allaah knows best. Sharh Muslim, 6/80 Secondly: With regard to what your imam does, putting his hand on his forehead and saying Yaa Hayyu, Yaa Qayyoom seven times, there is no basis in sharee’ah for doing this, and it is not in Saheeh Muslim or any other book of saheeh Sunnah. It is a reprehensible bid’ah (innovation) and you have to advise him to stop doing that and explain the shar’i ruling on innovated forms of dhikr. With regard to praying behind this imam: it is permissible but it is preferable if you can look for an imam who will establish the Sunnah and teach it to you, because there is the fear that some of the worshippers may be influenced by him and may imitate him and spread his bid’ah. But before doing that, do not forget to advise him and teach him the correct Sunnah for dhikr in particular and for worship in general. Then if he insists on his bid’ah, there is nothing wrong with you taking action to prevent him from leading the prayer. The scholars of the Standing Committee said: As for praying behind those who follow innovation, if their innovation involves shirk, such as calling upon someone other than Allaah, or making vows to someone other than Allaah, or believing that their shaykhs have characteristics which belong to no one but Allaah, such as having complete knowledge or knowledge of the unseen or influence over the universe, then it is not correct to pray behind them. But if their bid’ah does not involve shirk, such as reciting dhikr that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) but in unison and swaying, then prayers offered behind them are valid, but the Muslim should look for an imam to pray behind who is not an innovator, because that will bring him a greater reward and is farther removed from evil. And Allaah is the Source of Strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 7/353 And Allaah knows best."
458,Can You Go Hajj with a Mortgage?,Question I know that Hajj is not obligatory for one who owes a debt. Does this apply to one who has long-term debts? Some people may have mortgages which it will take a lifetime to pay off. Do they have to perform Hajj?,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “A debt which is due now takes precedence over Hajj, because this obligation comes before Hajj. So he should pay off the debt and do Hajj . If he has nothing left after paying off the debt , then he should wait until Allah makes him independent of means. If it is a long-term debt to be paid off at a future date, and the person feels confident that he will be able to pay it on the agreed date, then in this case the debt does not mean that Hajj is not obligatory for him, whether the lender gives him permission or not. If there is no guarantee that he will be able to pay it off as agreed, then he should wait until the date for the payment comes. Based on that we say, if a person owes a debt to the mortgage fund , if he knows that when the time comes he will pay his debt, then Hajj is obligatory for him, even if he owes a debt.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/96) . And Allah knows best."
459,Obligation of changing one's name upon accepting Islaam,Question Is it mandatory for one who newly embraces Islaam to change his or her name?,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. He or she is not required to change his or her name unless it embodies the worship of someone or something other then God, Allaah. However, its amelioration by choosing a new Islamic name is legitimate and encouraged. The fact that he or she would change his or her name from a pagan or non-Islamic name to an Islamic one would be considered commendable--however, it is not mandatory. Thus, if one's name is Abdul-Messiah, for example, or similar such names, then he is obligated to change it, as the Prophet (peace upon him) had people with the names Abdul-Ka'bah and Abdul-Uzzah change their names upon accepting Islaam. If the original name does not comprise or imply anything forbidden in Islaam, then he or she is permitted to retain it (such as the name George, for example). As noted, though, it is preferable to change it to an Islaamic name, as this also distinguishes him or her from the kuffaar. Note that if changing one's name in official documents and records poses a great inconvenience, it would suffice to change it among the people. In this case, he or she is called by his or her new name by friends, acquaintances, and the general public, while offical documents would retain the original given name."
460,Can You Pray Tahiyyatul Masjid before ‘Eid Prayer in a musalla?,"Question It has been proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to pray the ‘Eid prayers in the prayer-place [not the regular mosque, but a place designated for ‘Eid prayers], and men and women alike went out to pray with him. All of the Sahabah continued to do likewise after he died. Is it permissible for a person who goes to the ‘Eid prayers to pray two Rak`ahs for Tahiyyat al-Masjid in the prayer-place or not?","Praise be to Allah.A person who enters the prayer place to pray the ‘Eid prayer should not pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid before sitting down, because doing this is different to the way the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to do things. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. For more, please see these answers: 132432 , 11960 , 14387 , and 21206 ."
461,Is Ghusl Compulsory on ‘Eid?,"Question Is it compulsory to do ghusl on ‘Eid and when should one do ghusl for ‘Eid? Because if I do ghusl after Fajr, the time will be very limited, as the place where we pray the ‘Eid prayer is far away from my house.","Praise be to Allah.Is ghusl compulsory on ‘Eid? Doing ghusl on ‘Eid is mustahabb. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ghusl on the day of ‘Eid. It was also narrated that some of the Companions did ghusl on the day of ‘Eid , such as `Ali ibn Abi Talib, Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’: “All the isnads (of these reports) are weak and false except the report of Ibn ‘Umar. The evidence which may be taken as proof that it is mustahabb is the report of Ibn ‘Umar, and analogy with Jumu`ah.” Ibn al-Qayyim said: “There are two weak hadiths concerning this matter, but it was proven from Ibn `Umar, who was very keen to follow the Sunnah, that he used to do ghusl for ‘Eid before going out.” Time for ghusl on ‘Eid With regard to the time when one should do ghusl for ‘Eid , it is better to do that after Fajr prayer, but if one does it before Fajr that is sufficient, because of the shortness of time available after Fajr, because the people need to go to offer the ‘Eid prayer and the prayer place may be far away. It says in al-Muntaqa Sharh Muwatta al-Imam Malik: “It is mustahabb to do ghusl just before going out to the prayer-place. Ibn Habib said that the best time to do ghusl for ‘Eid is after praying Fajr. Malik said in al-Mukhtasar that if one does ghusl for ‘Eid before Fajr that is acceptable.” In Sharh Mukhtasar (2/102), Khalil said that the time for ghusl for ‘Eid is during the last one-sixth of the night. Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni: “The time for ghusl (for ‘Eid) is after the dawn comes, according to the apparent meaning of al-Khiraqi’s words. Al-Qadi and al-Amidi said: Ghusl before Fajr does not fulfil the Sunnah of doing ghusl, because the ghusl for a prayer should be done on that day and doing it before dawn does not meet that condition, as is the case with ghusl for Jumu’ah. Ibn ‘Aqil said: What is mentioned in the texts from Ahmad is (that it may be done) before Fajr and after, because the time for ‘Eid is more limited than the time for Jumu’ah, so if it is limited to the time after Fajr one may not be able to do it. And because the purpose behind it is to cleanse oneself, which may be achieved by doing ghusl at night because it is close to the time of prayer. But it is better to do it after Fajr, so as to avoid an area of scholarly dispute and to be more clean, because that is closer to the time of prayer.” Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’: “Concerning the time when this ghusl is valid, there are two well-known opinions. The view that it should be after dawn breaks was stated in al-Umm and the more correct view according to scholarly consensus is that it is permissible to do it both after Fajr and before. Al-Qadi Abu al-Tayyib said in his book al-Mujarrad, al-Shafi’i stated in al-Buwayti that ghusl for ‘Eid is valid before dawn breaks. Al-Nawawi said: If we say that according to the more correct view it is valid before dawn, then the most sound and most well-known view is that it is valid after half the night has passed, but it is not valid before then. The second view is that it is valid at any time of the night. This was the view of al-Ghazali, and was the view favoured by Ibn al-Sabbagh and others. The third view is that it is only valid just before Fajr. This was the view of al-Baghawi.” Based on this, there is nothing wrong with doing ghusl for ‘Eid before Fajr prayer if that will make it easier to go out to the ‘Eid prayer . And Allah knows best."
462,Is Delaying Hajj for No Reason Permissible?,Question What is the ruling on one who delays Hajj for no reason when he has the means and is able to do it?,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever is able to do Hajj and delays it for no reason has committed a great evil and a major sin. What he has to do is to repent to Allah from that and hasten to do Hajj. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [Aal 'Imran 3:97] Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing regular prayer; paying zakah; fasting Ramadan, and performing Pilgrimage to the House (the Ka’bah).” (Sahih – agreed upon. Al-Bukhari, 8; Muslim, 16) Prophet Muhammad also said, when Jibril (peace be upon him) asked him about Islam: “It means to testify that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish regular prayer, to pay zakah, to fast Ramadan, and to perform Pilgrimage to the House if you have the means to do so.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, 8, from the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)).

463,"If the imam says one tasleem, is it permissible for the one who is praying behind him to say two?","Question If the imam says one tasleem, is it permissible for me to say two tasleems? Please note that the Academic Council of Morocco approves of one tasleem in all mosques?","Praise be to Allah. The imam should not limit it to only one tasleem at the end of the prayer, because the second tasleem is prescribed and doing it is preferable. In fact Imam Ahmad and some of the Maalikis are of the view that it is obligatory, and that the prayer is not valid without it. However the majority of scholars are of the view that the second tasleem is Sunnah and mustahabb (encouraged). According to the view of the majority, limiting it to one tasleem does not render the prayer invalid. If the imam says one tasleem, there is nothing wrong with the one who is praying behind him saying the second tasleem, because doing that is more complete and is more on the safe side, and it avoids an area in which there is a scholarly difference of opinion. The well-known view of the madhhab of Imam Maalik is that the one who is praying behind the imam should say two tasleems, as will be explained below. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo‘ (3/462): The correct view according to our madhhab is that what is preferred is to say two tasleems. This is the view of the majority of scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een, and those who came after them. This was narrated by at-Tirmidhi, al-Qaadi Abu’t-Tayyib and others from the majority of scholars. It was also narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir from Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, Ibn Mas‘ood, ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir, and Naafi‘ ibn ‘Abd al-Haarith (may Allah be pleased with them). It was also narrated from the Taabi‘een ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah, ‘Alqamah, and Abu ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sulami; and from ath-Thawri, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Abu Thawr and ashaab ar-ra’y. Some scholars said that the worshipper should say one tasleem. This was the view of Ibn ‘Umar, Anas, Salamah ibn al-Akwa‘ and ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them), as well as al-Hasan, Ibn Sireen, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, Maalik and al-Awzaa‘i. Ibn al-Mundhir said: ‘Ammaar ibn Abi ‘Ammaar said: In the mosque of the Ansaar they used to say two tasleems and in the mosque of the Muhaajireen they used to say one tasleem. Ibn al-Mundhir said: I favour the former. Then an-Nawawi said: Our view is that what is obligatory is one tasleem, and the second is not obligatory. This was the view of the majority of scholars, or all of them. Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that the prayer of one who limits it to one tasleem is valid. At-Tahhaawi, al-Qaadi Abu’t-Tayyib and others narrated from al-Hasan ibn Saalih that he regarded both tasleems as obligatory. This was also narrated from Ahmad, and was the view of some of the companions of Maalik. End quote. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is prescribed to say two tasleems, right and left. That is because of the report narrated by Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I saw the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saying the tasleem, (turning his head) until the whiteness of his cheek could be seen, to the right and to the left. It was narrated from Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient for one of you to place his hand on his thigh, then say salaam to his brother on his right and on his left.” Narrated by Muslim. According to another version of the hadeeth of Ibn Mas‘ood: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to say the tasleem to his right: ‘As-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah’ and to his left: ‘As-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah.’ At-Tirmidhi said: The hadeeth of Ibn Mas‘ood is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. End quote from al-Mughni (1/323). The view of Imam Maalik, as it says in Mawaahib al-Jaleel (1/526) is that the worshipper should say three tasleems: the first to his right, to conclude and exit his prayer, the second, which he should intend as a greeting to the imam, and the third, which he should intend as a greeting to those who are on his left. This view was rejected by al-Qaadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi (may Allah have mercy on him), who favoured the view that the second tasleem should be intended as a greeting to both the imam and the other worshippers, and the third is a bid‘ah (innovation). He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He should say two tasleems: one to his right which he should intend to conclude and exit the prayer, and the second to his left which he should intend as a greeting to the imam and congregation. The third he should avoid, because it is a bid‘ah (innovation), that was not proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or the Sahaabah. End quote from Mawaahib al-Jaleel. To sum up: What is encouraged (mustahabb) is for the worshipper to say two tasleems, whether he is the imam or praying behind an imam, and if the imam limits it to one tasleem, it is encouraged for the worshipper who is praying behind him to say two tasleems, one to his right and the second to his left. And Allah knows best."
464,Meaning of the verse “And were it not that all mankind would have become of one community…” [az-Zukhruf 43:33],"Question What is the interpretation of the meaning of the verses 33, 34, 35 of Soorat az-Zukhruf? What do we learn from them? Is the message in these verses an answer to those who say: Why does the disbeliever live a life of luxury whilst the Muslim lives a life of hardship, poverty and misery? Is there any connection between these verses and the story of Qaroon? Was there a reason for the revelation of these verses?","Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And were it not that all mankind would have become of one community (all disbelievers, desiring worldly life only), We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Beneficent (Allah), silver roofs for their houses, and elevators (and stair-ways, etc. of silver) whereby they ascend, And for their houses, doors (of silver), and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline, And adornments of gold. Yet all this (i.e. the roofs, doors, stairs, elevators, thrones etc. of their houses) would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world. And the Hereafter with your Lord is only for the Muttaqoon (the pious)” [az-Zukhruf 43:33-35]. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is, were it not that many ignorant people would believe that Our bestowal of wealth is indicative of Our love for the recipient, so they would all come under the banner of disbelief for the sake of wealth – this is what was meant by the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas, al-Hasan, Qataadah, as-Suddi and others – “We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Beneficent (Allah), silver roofs for their houses, and elevators (and stair-ways)” that is, staircases and steps of silver – this was stated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid, Qataadah, as-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others – “whereby they ascend” that is, climb up. “And for their houses, doors” and locks on their doors “and thrones (of silver) on which they could recline” that is, all of that would be of silver “And adornments of gold”. Then He says: “Yet all this (i.e. the roofs, doors, stairs, elevators, thrones etc. of their houses) would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world” that is, this is only part of that transient, temporary world that is insignificant before Allah, may He be exalted. In other words, because of the good things they do in this world, He hastens to give them fine food and drink, so that when they come to the Hereafter, they will have no good deeds for which the reward will still be outstanding. Then He says: “And the Hereafter with your Lord is only for the Muttaqoon (the pious)” that is, it is only for them and will not be shared with anyone else. End quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (7/226-227). See also Tafseer as-Sa ‘di (p. 765) Secondly: The lesson we learn from these verses comes in the context of criticism of the life of this world, for it is not worth the weight of a gnat’s wing. If Allah so willed, He could give the disbeliever everything he desires of this world, because it is so insignificant to Him and he (the disbeliever) is so insignificant to Him, may He be glorified. But by His mercy, He does not grant him all types of worldly gain, lest people be tempted by that and hasten to disbelieve, and they forget the hereafter. Ibn Abi Shaybah (7/105) narrated with a saheeh isnaad from Ibn Mas‘ood who said: Verily Allah grants worldly gain to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love, but He does not grant faith to anyone except those whom He loves. If Allah loves a person, He grants him faith. Therefore what the Muslim must do, if he is living a life of hardship in this world and he sees the disbeliever living a life of ease, is not to be sad; rather he should think positively of Allah and understand that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is not withholding worldly gain from him because he is insignificant to Him, and He does not give it to the disbeliever as an honour to him; rather it is the other way round. Al-Bukhaari (4913) and Muslim (1479) narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) entered upon the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and he had been sleeping on a reed mat that had left marks on his side, and beneath his head was a pillow of leather stuffed with palm fibres. ‘Umar said: I saw the marks left by the reed mat on his side, and I wept. He said: What is making you weep? I said: O Messenger of Allah, verily Chosroes and Caesar are living the lives they live, but you are the Messenger of Allah! He said: “Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for you?” Thirdly: We do not know of any specific reason for the revelation of these verses; rather they come under the same category as other verses that condemn this world and those who care only about it, and urge people to seek the hereafter and its reward and status, and what Allah has prepared in it for its people of eternal bliss, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:185] “And the life of this world is nothing but play and amusement. But far better is the house in the Hereafter for those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious). Will you not then understand?” [al-An‘aam 6:32]. With regard to the story of Qaroon, it is a practical, real-life example, and definitive proof, that highlights the message of these verses and others which condemn this world and show how the people whose main focus is this world were distracted by it from the hereafter, and they were content with it and thus were distracted from obeying and worshipping Allah, and how they were punished in this world. If people gain all luxuries and all good things in this world, they become insolent and transgress, and they forget to give thanks for the blessings. Fear of its temptation should make one lose interest in it and focus on the hereafter, and it should prompt one to use whatever blessings one has been given in obedience to Allah, for that is part of perfect gratitude. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “That home of the Hereafter (i.e. Paradise), We shall assign to those who rebel not against the truth with pride and oppression in the land nor do mischief by committing crimes. And the good end is for the Muttaqoon (pious)” [al-Qasas 28:83]. For more information, please see the answer to question no. 84091 . And Allah knows best.."
465,Is there anyone in Paradise now?,"Question Is anyone in heaven right now (not prophets , angels etc) ? Or are we all waiting for the 'Day of Judgment' before entering heaven or hell I have heard some references to people who have seen heaven or are in heaven now or went to heaven and saw how it was Again, I am not including prophets and angels to this list of people","Praise be to Allah.Allaah has created Paradise and its creation is complete, because He says in a hadeeth qudsi: ""I have prepared for My righteous slaves that which no eye has seen…"" And because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw it on the night of the Israa' and Mi'raaj, and because of other proofs (daleel). Will any humans enter it before the Day of Resurrection? There are two aspects to this: 1. Entering it in spirit only, as is the case with the dead. This is proven in the case of the Prophets, and of the martyrs (shuhadaa') whose souls are in the crops of green birds which roam about in Paradise. This is also known from the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describes how he entered Paradise in dreams, which has to do with the soul or spirit. 2. With regard to entering Paradise in both body and soul, this will happen on the Day of Resurrection for both humans and jinn. The only exception to this is Adam (peace be upon him) who was in Paradise before he came down to this earth, as was mentioned by Ibn al-Qayyim and others. And Allaah knows best."
466,The health and religious benefits of circumcision,"Question Being not a religious person I wonder why (jewish and)islamic people consider circumcision obligatory. It seems to me that a muslim considers every human being as a perfect creation of Allah. So why doubt this perfection by changing God's creation? I know of course about hygienic considerations, but I really hope that you can give an answer to my question. Thank you for your kindness.","Praise be to Allah.The Muslim obeys the command of Allaah. This is the meaning of Islam, which is submission to Allaah and obedience to His command, whether the wisdom behind it is clear to him or not, because the One Who is issuing the command – Allaah, may He be exalted – is the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware, who created mankind and knows what is good for them and what is not good for them. Circumcision is one of the rulings of sharee’ah which the Muslim carries out willingly, in submission to and out of love for Allaah, and seeking reward with Him. He is certain that Allaah does not command anything unless there is a wisdom behind it and it is good for His slaves, whether people know that or not. Since your question referred to the health benefits of circumcision, we will, after looking at the shar’i (religious) benefits, will answer your question about the health benefits, in order to increase the believers in faith in the ruling, and so that non-Muslims may see one aspect of the greatness of this sharee’ah (Islamic law) which came to bring benefits and ward off harm. 1 – The shar’i (religious) benefits: Circumcision is one of the commands concerning beautification enjoined by Allaah, which Allaah has prescribed for His slaves to make them beautiful both outwardly and inwardly (physically and spiritually). It is the perfection of the fitrah (natural state of man) with which He created them, and hence it is the perfection of the haneefiyyah (pure monotheism) of the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham). The origin of the institution of circumcision as the perfection of haneefiyyah was when Allaah made a covenant with Ibraaheem and promised to make him an imaam (leader) of mankind, and promised him that he would be the father of many people, that prophets and kings would come from his loins and that his descendants would be many. And He told him that between him and his descendants there would be the sign of the covenant, which would be that every newborn male among them would be circumcised, and so the covenant would have this sign on their bodies. Circumcision is a sign of having entered into the religion of Ibraaheem, and this is in accordance with the interpretation of the verse (interpretation of the meaning) – “[Our Sibghah (religion) is] the Sibghah (religion) of Allaah (Islam) and which Sibghah (religion) can be better than Allaah’s? And we are His worshippers” [al-Baqarah 2:138] – as referring to circumcision. For the haneefs (pure monotheists, i.e., Muslims), circumcision has the same status as baptism does for the worshippers of the cross (i.e., Christians). They purify their children – as they say – when they baptize them in the baptismal water, and they say, now he has become a Christian. Allaah has prescribed for the haneefs their own rite, the symbol of which is circumcision. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “[Our Sibghah (religion) is] the Sibghah (religion) of Allaah (Islam) and which Sibghah (religion) can be better than Allaah’s? And we are His worshippers” [al-Baqarah 2:138] – … So Allaah has made circumcision a symbol of those who belong to Him and to His religion, and who attribute themselves to Him as being utterly enslaved to Him alone… The point here is that the religion of Allaah is haneefiyyah (pure monotheism) which fills the heart with knowledge and love of Him and sincerity towards Him, and worship of Him alone with no partner or associate, and which marks the body with the characteristics of the fitrah, namely circumcision, removal of the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, plucking the hair from the armpits, rinsing the mouth, rinsing the nose, using the siwaak (toothbrush made from twigs from a certain tree) and cleaning oneself after elimination of urine or faeces. So the fitrah of Allaah is manifested in the hearts of the haneefs and on their bodies. (Tuhfat al-Mawdood bi Ahkaam al-Mawlood by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 351) Circumcision also has health benefits and brings a lot of benefits to the boy in his life. (See Question # 2425). It is not essential for the child to remain as he is when he comes forth from his mother’s womb, if there is something that may be done for him that serves a purpose and is enjoined by the pure religion. Such things include shaving his head after he is born, because that is in his best interests. The Prophet of Islam (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Remove the harm from him.” The same applies to washing the blood from him and cutting the cord by which he was attached to his mother, and other things which are done to benefit him. 2 – The health benefits: Dr. Muhammad ‘Ali al-Baar (a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and a consultant to the Islamic Medicine department of the King Fahd Centre for Medical Research in the King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah) says in his book al-Khitaan (Circumcision): “Circumcision of newborn boys (i.e., within the first month of life) brings numerous health benefits, including: 1 – Protection against local infection in the penis, which may result from the presence of the foreskin, causing tightening of the foreskin, which may lead to retention of urine or infections of the glans (tip) of the penis – which require circumcision in order to treat these problems. In chronic cases, the child may be exposed to numerous diseases in the future, the most serious of which is cancer of the penis. 2 – Infections of the urethra. Many studies have proven thatuncircumcised boys are more exposed to infection of the urethra. In some studies the rate was 39 times more among uncircumcised boys. In other studies the rate was ten times more. Other studies showed that 95% of children who suffered from infections of the urethra were uncircumcised, whereas the rate among circumcised children did not exceed 5%. In children, infection of the urethra is serious in some cases. In the study by Wisewell on 88 children who suffered infections of the urethra, in 36 % of them, the same bacteria was found in the blood also. Three of them contracted meningitis, and two suffered renal failure. Two others died as a result of the spread of the micro-organisms throughout the body. 3 – Protection against cancer of the penis:the studies agree that cancer of the penis is almost non-existent among circumcised men, whereas the rate among uncircumcised men is not insignificant. In the US the rate of penile cancer among circumcised men is zero, whilst among uncircumcised men it is 2.2 in every 100,000 of the uncircumcised population. As most of the inhabitants of the US are circumcised, the cases of this cancer there are between 750 and 1000 per year. If the population were not circumcised, the number of cases would reach 3000. In countries where boys are not circumcised, such as China, Uganda and Puerto Rico, penile cancer represents between 12-22 % of all cancers found in men; this is a very high percentage. 4 – Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Researchers found that the STDs which are transmitted via sexual contact (usually because of fornication/adultery and homosexuality) spread more among those who are not circumcised, especially herpes, soft chancres, syphilis, candida, gonorrhea and genital warts. There are numerous modern studies which confirm that circumcision reduces the possibility of contracting AIDS when compared to their uncircumcised counterparts. But that does not rule out the possibility of a circumcised man contracting AIDS as the result of sexual contact with a person who has AIDS. Circumcision is not a protection against it, and there is no real way of protecting oneself against the many sexually transmitted diseases apart from avoiding fornication/adultery, promiscuity, homosexuality and other repugnant practices. (From this we can see the wisdom of Islamic sharee’ah in forbidding fornication/adultery and homosexuality). 5 – Protection of wives against cervical cancer. Researchers have noted that the wives of circumcised men have less risk of getting cervical cancer than the wives of uncircumcised men. From al-Khitaan, p. 76, by Dr. Muhammad al-Baar. And Allaah knows best. Reference: Professor Wisewell, published in the American Family Doctor Magazine, issue no. 41, 1991 CE."
467,Deceiving and lying are not permitted in dealings with others,"Question We have a shop selling auto parts. When we want to write the bill for the customer, we deduct part of the amount, but he asks us to write the original price on the bill, and he does that because the product is not for him. What is the ruling on that?","Praise be to Allah.If this involves deceit and cheating, it is not permissible under any circumstances. It is haraam for you to give him a bill stating more than the amount which he paid in order to take money from the state or any other body for this bill. This is deceit and cheating, and is not allowed. And Allaah knows best."
468,Can You Recite Part of a Surah in Prayer?,"Question After reciting Surat al-Fatihah in each rak`ah, is it permissible to recite only part of one long surah instead of a whole one so that a few long surahs are completed during the whole prayer instead of many short surahs?","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to recite part of a long surah in prayer instead of reciting a complete short surah, but it is better to recite a complete surah in each rak`ah. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) usually did. Al-Bukhari (762) and Muslim (451) narrated that Abu Qatadah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite al-Fatihah and another surah in the first two rak`ahs of Zuhr and ‘Asr.” This hadith indicates that “reciting a short surah in full is better than reciting an equal part of a longer surah.” (Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi (4/174). The words of Abu Qatadah - “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite…” indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) persisted in doing that, or that this is what he usually did. (Fath al-Bari, 2/244) It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited certain surahs in certain prayers. Muslim (727) narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite ‘Say (O Muslims): “We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us…’ [al-Baqarah 2:136 – interpretation of the meaning] and ‘Come to a word that is just between us and you…’ [Al ‘Imran 3:64 – interpretation of the meaning] in the two rak`ahs of Fajr prayer.” This hadith indicates that it is permissible to recite part of a surah in a rak`ah. (Nayl al-Awtar, 2/255) Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to recite a complete surah , and sometimes he would recite a complete surah over the two rak`ahs; or he would recite the first part of a surah. As for reciting the last part of a surah, or the middle part of a surah, it was not narrated that he did that; and as for reciting two surahs in one rak`ah, he would do that in nafil prayers, but it was not narrated that he did that in fard prayers. The hadith of Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him), “I know the pairs of surahs that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would recite in one rak`ah. He would recite Surat al-Rahman and Surat al-Najm in one rak`ah, or Surat al-Qamar and Surat al-Haqqah in one rak`ah, or Surat al-Tur and Surat al-Dhariyat in one rak`ah, or Surat al-Waqi’ah and Surat al-Qalam in one rak`ah.” This hadith indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, but it does not specify whether he did it in fard (obligatory) prayers or nafil (supererogatory) prayers. The hadith may mean either. As for reciting one surah in two rak`ahs, he used to do that rarely. Abu Dawud narrated from a man from Juhaynah that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reciting Surat al-Zalzalah in two rak`ahs of Fajr prayer, and he said: “I do not know whether the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forgot or did he do that deliberately?” (Zad al-Ma’ad, 1/214-215) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is nothing wrong with a man reciting one verse from a surah in an obligatory prayer or in a nafl prayer. This may be understood from the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘So, recite you of the Qur’an as much as may be easy for you’ [al-Muzzammil 73:20] But the Sunnah – which is preferable – is to recite a surah , and the best is to recite one surah in each rak`ah. If that is too difficult then it is acceptable to divide the surah between the two rak`ahs.” (al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/104) And Allah knows best."
469,Advice to those who do not recognize the Salafi scholars and call them Wahhaabis,"Question what do you say to those who do not acknowledge (for whatever reason) the scholars of today such as shaikh Uthaymeen, shaykh bin Baaz raheemahullah, shaykh Al-Albaani raheemahullah? a few call them wahabi and say that these scholars follow a new sect rather than the universal deen of al-Islam that was followed by all the major scholars of the past.","Praise be to Allah.The Muslim is obliged to accept the teachings of Islam, and act upon them. When he hears of some word or deed which is based on evidence (daleel) from the Qur’aan or Sunnah, then he has to accept it and give it priority over anything else. He should check what people say against the evidence of sharee’ah, and only accept those views which are in accordance with that evidence. It is known that Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) called people to Tawheed and he wrote his famous book on that topic which is called Kitaab al-Tawheed. In this book he limited himself to quoting only the clear evidence from the verses of the Qur’aan and the saheeh ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Commentaries on this book were written by his grandson ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan and other scholars. Hence none of his opponents can refute this book or claim that his evidence is false. They fabricated lies and believed them, so they believed that he was misguided. They gave the same label to the scholars of the Muslims such as Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on them both). It is known that the shaykhs whom we have mentioned did not deviate from the correct view with regard to beliefs and actions; they followed the same path as the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, the four imaams, the authors of the Six Books and others. Those who do not acknowledge them do that either out of ignorance, blind imitation of others, jealousy, stubbornness or following their own whims and desires, or adherence to traditions, bid’ah (innovation) and evil actions that go against the evidence (of sharee’ah). Earlier and later scholars have proven such people to be wrong. So we must follow the evidence and give it priority over the views of all people."
470,Female student speaking with her male teacher in the university,Question A young man teaches us in the university. Is it permissible for us to ask him questions and speak to him about the subjects we are studying?.,"Praise be to Allah. In question no 1200 we explained that free mixing between men and women is haraam, and we explained that harm that this causes to people’s spiritual and worldly interests. As this is the case, then what you must do is not to remain in a place where there is free mixing between men and women, except in cases of necessity. If the university is for girls and the teachers are men, then there is less danger. But those who follow their whims and desires will keep trying to remove every barrier between the sexes. So we advise you to fear Allaah and to remember that He is watching you in private and in public. See also question no. 8827. With regard to a woman speaking to a man for some necessary purpose, there is no sin in it, subject to the condition that they should not be alone together (khulwah or seclusion), even if that is in an office or classroom, with no one else present. They should also remain formal and dignified, and observe proper hijab, and take care to speak only about what is necessary without saying anything more, or softening the voice. There should also be no danger of fitnah. If the woman feels any kind of desire or speaks to men simply for fun, or if that applies to the man, then it is haraam for them to speak together, because of the fitnah and sin involved. And Allaah knows best. See also question no. 1121, 10156."
471,Wants to become Muslim but lives in drug country,"Question Dear Sir, For a muslim, is it allowed to use drugs like cocaine . Here in Columbia 70 % of the people use it . When I want to become a muslim, must I stop it ? I am waiting for your answer.","Praise be to Allah.It is a great thing to learn that you are thinking of embracing Islam, although you live in a country where drugs are rife and are not following any religion at present. We were amazed and impressed to know that a man living in such circumstances has reached the point where he wants to become Muslim, but Allaah is able to do all things, and He guides whom He wills to the Straight Path. Perhaps the Divine care has been preparing you to embrace the true religion in spite of the intense darkness, kufr (disbelief) and drug-ridden atmosphere that surround you. The unbelieving man is dead at heart even though his body is alive, but when Allaah guides him to the light of Islam, his heart awakens and he sees a whole new meaning to life as he starts to follow the guidance of his Lord. Allaah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning): “Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and faith) and set for him a Light (belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out?…” [al-An’aam 6:122]. So come to true life, and follow the Light which Allaah has revealed, and you will find that which will delight you and bring you peace of mind, when you worship Allaah. As regards the issue of drugs, no doubt you would expect this great religion to forbid everything that is harmful and to permit everything that is beneficial, and not to allow man to lose his mind and go crazy, doing all kinds of foolish things without any awareness and destroying his body. This is what happens when people take drugs and prevent themselves from thinking about or worshipping Allaah. This poison opens the door to hostile aggression, and destroys religion, lives, minds, honour and wealth. And so no wise person can doubt that drugs are totally forbidden. We fully understand that addiction is no straightforward matter and that recovery is no simple process, but this should not prevent you from entering Islam and embracing the way of truth with which Allaah has sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Rest assured that when you embrace Islam, this will give you strength and will-power to overcome this addiction and rid yourself of this disease and sin. All of this may take some time, but this should not make you hesitate to embrace Islam. Become Muslim and you will be safe from the problems of this world and the punishment of the Hereafter. We are prepared to stand by you and help you with any difficulty that you may face. We thank you for your question and ask Allaah to guide you soon. Peace be upon those who follow the truth."
472,"When she got her period in Ramadan, she broke her fast and did not make up the missed fasts","Question There is a woman who has reached the age of sixty. She was unaware of the rulings on menstruation for many years, during her childbearing years. She did not make up the fasts that she missed in Ramadaan, thinking that she did not have to do so according to what she heard from the common folk.","Praise be to Allah.She has to repent to Allaah from that, because she did not ask knowledgeable people. She also has to make up the fasts that she missed, fasting the number of days that she thinks she most likely missed. She also has to offer expiation for each day by feeding one poor person half a saa’ of wheat, dates, or rice etc., of the local staple food, if she is able to do so. If she is not able to feed the poor then she is not obliged to do so and it is sufficient for her to make up the missed fasts. And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions."
473,Decorating a room with peacock feathers,"Question salam; i have recently redecorated my bedroom and have used peacock feathers in one piece of decoration. My question is then what does Islam say about such use, is it permitted or not, can one pray in the room. Many thanks.","Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using peacock feathers for decoration, and there is nothing wrong with praying in the place you mention. And Allaah knows best."
474,She vowed to fast for a month if Allaah caused her husband to mend his ways,"Question A woman vowed that if Allaah caused her husband to mend his ways and become knowledgeable, she would fast for a month. But until now her husband has not mended his ways. We heard that she has to fast for a month anyway, to discipline herself even if her husband did not mend his ways, because this vow is regarded as a means to get a charitable donation from a miser. What is your opinion, O Shaykh?.","Praise be to Allah. Vows are makrooh in principle, and should not be made, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6608) and Muslim (1639) that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade vows and said: “They do not avert anything, all they do is get something out of a stingy person.” Al-Bukhaari (6609) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A vow does not bring the son of Adam anything that I have not decreed for him, but vowing is imposed on him by way of foreordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his wealth.” Although it is makrooh to make vows, it is obligatory to fulfil a vow to do an act of worship, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allaah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6318). Secondly: Your saying “If Allaah causes my husband to mend his ways and he becomes knowledgeable I will fast for a month” is a vow to do an act of worship, depending on a condition. When the condition is fulfilled, it becomes obligatory to fulfil the vow. If the condition is not fulfilled, you do not have to do anything. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning vows to do acts of worship and righteous deeds: They are of three types, one of which is doing an act of worship in return for a blessing that is attained or a misfortune that is warded off, such as saying, ‘If Allaah heals me, I must fast for a month’. So the act of worship becomes binding although it is not ordinarily binding, such as fasting, prayer, charity and Hajj. This must be fulfilled according to scholarly consensus. End quote from al-Mughni (13/622). It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (12/315): The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to make a vow conditional, and it is not obligatory to fulfil it before the condition is fulfilled, because the reason for fulfilling the vow is not present. When the condition is fulfilled, it becomes obligatory to fulfil the vow. End quote. Thus it is clear that what you have heard is not entirely correct. A vow may make a miser give some of his wealth, but the conditional vow does not have to be fulfilled unless the condition is met. It would have been better for you, instead of making a vow, to advise your husband and help him and guide him to pray and do good deeds and seek knowledge, and make a lot of du’aa’ for him. We ask Allaah to help you both to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows best."
475,How can he know the times of prayer when he is on board the plane?,Question A man is going to travel by plane from al-Dammam to Japan on a flight that will last for 12 hours in sha Allaah. How can he know the times for prayer when he is on board the plane?.,"Praise be to Allah.The one who is travelling by plane should pray when the time for prayer begins. In this case he can know it by the visible signs for the times of Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr. When the sun sets, then the time for Maghrib begins. When the red afterglow disappears, then the time for ‘Isha’ begins. When the dawn breaks, then the time for Fajr begins. As for Zuhr and ‘Asr, you can work it out. If you know their timings in the countries over which you are flying, then you should delay the prayer for a short period and then pray, because time in the air is not like time on the ground. And you can join Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’, at the time of the earlier or later prayer, depending on what is easiest for you. You could also ask the pilot, because he may have equipment that will enable him to work out the times of prayer in the air. For more information on the times of prayer – on the ground – in most countries of the world, along with lines of latitude and longitude and the direction of the qiblah, you can visit the website and print out the prayer times for the country you are going to visit and over which you will travel on your journey as well. It should be noted that if a person does not know the times but he tries to work it out as best he can, and prays, then his prayer is valid, unless he finds out that he prayed before the time for prayer began, in which case he should repeat it. But if he does not find out anything, then he does not have to do anything. And Allaah knows best."
476,She gave a painkiller to a patient with heart failure and the patient died,"Question If there was a (female) doctor to whom a patient with heart failure was brought, and she gave her a painkiller in her jugular vein, and she died after approximately one hour or less, and the doctor does not know whether the cause of death was the painkiller or the heart failure, and she does not know where the patient lives, and after she gave her the painkiller, she read that this painkiller could kill the patient quickly if it is given in the jugular vein, and she gave it to her a little quickly, even she did not know that before using it, is this regarded as accidental killing? Because when the patient arrived it looked as if she was dying. What should this doctor do? If it was accidental killing, how can she pay the diyah (blood money) when she does not know where the patient lived? If she does not have enough money to pay the diyah, what is the ruling? If she finds the family of the deceased and they demand qisaas (legal retribution), what is the solution? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good. How could she know whether the patient died because of the heart failure or because of the medicine that was used to ease her pain?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: If the doctor made a mistake in prescribing the medication or in the manner in which it was administered, and the patient died or lost a limb or organ, he is liable and must offer expiation and pay the diyah, unless the next of kin of the deceased lets him off paying the diyah. And there is no qisaas in this case, because his wrongdoing was not intentional. In the answer to question no. 114047 we discussed cases in which the doctor is liable, among which are the following: “2. Treatment by one who is ignorant; because of his ignorance he is regarded as having transgressed, and the hadeeth quoted above states that he is liable. “Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: According to sharee‘ah, the ignorant doctor is liable. If he deals with medicine and practices medicine without any previous knowledge thereof, then he is causing harm and death because of ignorance, he is being negligent by practising that of which he has no knowledge, and he is cheating the sick person, therefore he must be liable. “… 4. If a skilled doctor makes a mistake in prescribing treatment: likewise the skilled doctor is liable if he tries to work out the best prescription for treating a patient, but he makes a mistake, and the treatment damages a limb or organ, or kills the patient. “5. The skilled doctor who does something that other doctors of this specialty do not do: this refers to a doctor who overstepped the bounds as established by the medical profession or falls short in diagnosis.” End quote. Secondly: In light of what you mention of the possibility that the patient died because of the way the painkiller was administered, we think that you should present this question in detail to three trustworthy doctors who are specialized in cardiology. If they agree that the way in which the painkiller was administered was the cause of death – as appears to be the case – then you are liable [i.e., you must pay the diyah and offer expiation]. Otherwise you do not have to do anything, because the basic principle is that you are free of blame. See also the fatwa of the Standing Committee (Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, 25/81). If these doctors determine that you caused the patient’s death, then you have to look for the family of the deceased and tell them, and it is up to them whether to demand the diyah or let you off. However, this diyah is not due from you; rather it is due from your ‘aaqilah (male relatives on your father's side). If you do not have any ‘aaqilah, or if they refuse or are unable to pay, then the ruling is to be decided by the qaadi (shar‘i judge). With regard to the expiation, it is fasting for two consecutive months. And Allah knows best."
477,Conditions of I’tikaaf,"Question What are the conditions of i'tikaf? Is fasting one of them? Is it permissible for the mu’takif (person in i’tikaf) to visit one who is sick, or to accept an invitation, or to attend to his family’s needs, or to attend a funeral, or to go to work?","Praise be to Allah.Conditions of i’tikaf It is prescribed to observe i’tikaf in a mosque in which prayers in congregation are held. If the mu’takif is one of those for whom Jumu’ah is obligatory and the period of his i’tikaf will include a Friday, it is better for him to stay in a mosque where Jumu’ah prayer is observed. It is not a condition for him or her to be fasting. Things to avoid during i’tikaf The Sunnah is for the mu’takif not to visit any sick person during his i'tikaf , or to accept any invitation, attend to his family’s needs, attend any funeral or go to work outside the mosque. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Sunnah for the mu’takif is not to visit any sick person, or attend any funeral, or touch or be intimate with any woman, or go out for any reason except those which cannot be avoided.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2473) And Allah knows best."
478,Do You Have to Do ‘Umrah Immediately Upon Arrival?,"Question I live in Jordan and I intend to go for `Umrah, in sha Allah. I am going to enter ihram from the miqat and go to Makkah. My question is: when do I have to enter the Haram and perform the rituals of `Umrah? Should I do that straightaway, or can I go to the hotel and take a shower and sleep and rest after travelling, then go to the Haram and perform `Umrah, because it is a long and exhausting journey, and I want to perform the rituals of `Umrah when I have more energy. Please note that I am going to adhere to the conditions of ihram, including not wearing tailored clothing or perfume and so on.","Praise be to Allah.Do you have to do ‘Umrah straight away? The Sunnah for the one who goes to Makkah for Hajj or `Umrah is to start first of all with al-Masjid al-Haram and do tawaf (circumambulate the Ka‘bah) before he goes to any other place. That is because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1642) and Muslim (1235) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The first thing he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did when he came to Makkah was to do wudu then circumambulate the House.” Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The hadith of ‘Aishah was narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. Our companions said: As soon as he enters Makkah, he should not try to find a place to stay or change his garments or do anything else except tawaf. Rather some of the group should stay with their luggage and mounts so that the others can perform tawaf, then they should come back to their mounts and luggage and find accommodation.” (Al-Majmu‘, 8/15) Imam al-Shafi` ‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “We have not heard that when he entered Makkah he stopped at any place, either in his Hajj or his `Umrah , until he entered the mosque, and he did not do anything when he entered the mosque, either bowing or anything else, until he started with the House and performed tawaf. He did this in both his Hajj and his `Umrah.” (Al-Umm, 2/185 ) From the above it is clear that the Sunnah is for the muhrim (pilgrim in ihram ) to start the rituals from when he reaches the Haram, following the example of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – as stated above – and because leaving a long interval may be a cause of committing some of the actions that are forbidden whilst in ihram. Can you sleep in ihram? But if a person is very tired because of having travelled a long way, and he delays `Umrah so that he can rest, there is nothing wrong with that. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If a person comes to Makkah and is tired, and he is not able to perform `Umrah until the following day, what is the ruling on that? Is it essential to perform `Umrah as soon as one reaches al-Masjid al-Haram? He replied: “It is best for the person who has come to do `Umrah to start, before anything else, by doing `Umrah, even before he goes to his accommodation. So he should perform `Umrah because that is the purpose (for which he came). But if he delays it, especially if he is tired, so that he can rest, there is nothing wrong with him doing that and his `Umrah is still valid.” (Majmu‘ Fatawa al-Shaykh, 22/285) And Allah knows best."
479,Ruling on a woman talking to the tailor,Question What is the ruling on a woman talking to the owner of a clothes shop or a tailor?.,"Praise be to Allah. If a woman talks to the owner of the clothes shop only as much as is necessary, with no fitnah involved, there is nothing wrong with it. Women used to talk to men with regard to their needs or matters in which there is no fitnah, within the limits of necessity. But if it is accompanied by laughter, chatting or softening of the voice, then it is haraam and is not permissible. Allaah said to the wives of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (may Allaah be pleased with them): “then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner” [al-Ahzaab 33:32 – interpretation of the meaning]. An honourable manner is that which is customarily known as such and is done according to necessity. As for anything more than that, if it is done with laughter and chatting, or with an alluring voice and so on, or she uncovers her face in front of him or uncovers her forearm or hands, all of these actions are haraam and evil, and are causes of fitnah and immorality. The Muslim woman who fears Allaah must do her duty towards Allaah, and not speak to non-mahram men in ways that may raise their hopes or tempt them. If she needs to go to a shop or a place where there are men, she should be modest and cover herself, and follow Islamic etiquette. If she speaks to men, she should speak in an honourable manner in which there is no fitnah and nothing dubious. End quote."
480,What is the ruling on marrying a Jewish or Christian woman who is pregnant from a previous relationship?,"Question I am living in Portugal and I am Muslim, praise be to Allah. I have a question about marrying a non-Muslim woman (one of the People of the Book – Jewish or Christian) who believes in the existence of God, and she is pregnant from a man who did not marry her. Is marriage to her valid, and does she have to observe ‘iddah like a Muslim woman?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: In order for marriage to a Jewish or Christian woman to be valid, it is stipulated that she should be chaste, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “(Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time, when you have given their due Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girl-friends” [al-Maa’idah 5:5]. What is meant by “chaste women” in this verse is free (i.e., not slave) and chaste women from among the People of the Book. It is permissible for a Muslim man to marry them. But if the woman is not chaste, then it is not permissible to marry her, regardless of whether she is Muslim or Jewish or Christian, until she repents. Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan as-Sa ‘di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for immoral women who do not refrain from zina (unlawful sexual relationships), it is not permissible to marry them, whether they are Muslim or Jewish or Christian, until they repent, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a Mushrikah…” [an-Noor 24:3]. End quote from the Tafseer of Shaykh as-Sa‘di (p. 221) Based on that, it is not permissible for you to marry the woman mentioned, because the condition of chastity is not fulfilled in her case. For more information, please see the answer to question no. 33656. Secondly: If a woman is pregnant from marriage or an illicit relationship, it is not permissible to marry her until her ‘iddah ends. The ‘iddah ends when her pregnancy ends, based on the report narrated by Abu Dawood (2185) from Ruwayfi‘ ibn Thaabit al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “It is not permissible for any man who believes in Allah and the Last Day to pour his water on the crop of another man (i.e., have intercourse with a pregnant woman).” Classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood Based on that, if that woman repents from zina (illicit sexual relationship) and becomes chaste, then it is permissible for you to marry her after the end of her ‘iddah, which is when she gives birth. The same conditions are stipulated for marriage to a Christian woman as are stipulated for marriage to a Muslim woman, namely the permission of her guardian and the presence of witnesses, as has been explained in the answer to question no. 159297. What has been explained above regarding this issue has to do with the shar‘i ruling. However with regard to advice, our advice is that a Muslim should not go ahead with such a marriage, firstly because there is no guarantee that this woman will not go back to her previous way of life, having illicit relationships. Moreover, marriage to a Christian or Jewish woman will have an impact on the religion and character of the children and of the husband in most cases. So refraining from such a marriage is preferable and safer. Since even in marriages to chaste Jewish and Christian women there have been real-life negative consequences and problems, which would make a wise man hesitate and ask himself a hundred and one times before going ahead with such a marriage, then how will it be if the situation is as you have described? In that case you will have combined two troublesome matters. We ask Allah to keep you safe and sound. And Allah knows best."
481,Using the word “create” in relation to anyone other than Allaah,"Question Many muslims use the word 'create' for human biengs, e.g 'he has a creative mind ' or 'He or she created this or that. Even some very good muslims are using this word in their books. The only creator is Allah ,so is it right to use this word for human biengs","Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly Allaah is the Only Creator. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Is there any creator other than Allaah who provides for you from the sky (rain) and the earth?” [Faatir: 35:3] But the word khalaqa (create) has been used in reference to others apart from Allaah, for example in the verse (interpretation of the meaning); “So Blessed is Allaah, the Best of creators” [al-Mu’minoon 23:14] And in al-Saheehayn it is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that on the Day of Resurrection it will be said to the image-makers, “Bring to life that which you have created!” When the word khalaqa (create) is used in reference to Allaah, it means bringing something into existence from nothing. This is what no one else is able to do besides Allaah. But when the word khalaqa is used in reference to man, it means transforming something from one shape into another. If it is used with reference to someone other than Allaah, saying that he creates in the sense that he changes a thing from one shape into another, then this is correct. But if it is used with reference to someone other than Allaah, saying that he creates in the sense that he brings something into existence from nothing, then this is not permissible. And Allaah knows best. Kitaab al-Qawl al-Mufeed ‘ala Kitaab al-Tawheed by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 1/6 With regard to what some people say, “So and so has a creative mind”, what they mean by that is that he is smart, and is able to come up with new and good ideas. There is nothing wrong with that, Islamically speaking, but it is better to explain to avoid such phrases which may be misunderstood. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad."
482,The father did not divide the estate in accordance with sharee‘ah and he deprived his siblings (of their share of the estate); do they have to re-divide it?,"Question My grandfather died long ago leaving behind few property,my father was only son and he had four sisters,only one was married,after the death of my grandfather, my father did not divide property as we are told in Islam,instead he spent on his sisters for their marriage and all and made a house for him and one of his unmarried sister,and in doing all this he sold all property ,then he became ill and remain in bed till his death,we are four sisters, in last years of my fathers life we sell our house and build a new one in an other city,now all the time one thought came in my mind that my father will get punished for what he did with his fathers property ,as he did not devide it as Allah command us to do,now what can i do,should we sell our house and give it to my fathers sisters now ,please keep in mind three of us are now married and in that house my mother is living with one of my unmarried sister.please answer me what can i do now that my father do not get panished for what he did, i will be thankful to you.","Praise be to Allah. What you must do is to divide the estate of your grandfather to all his heirs as commanded by Allah, may He be exalted, with each male getting the share of two females. If your father paid any of his own money during the building of the house, attention should be paid to that when dividing the estate. The same applies if you paid anything of your own wealth when buying the other house. This division of the estate is not only required to discharge the duty of your father; rather it is also required to discharge your duty too, because now you are living in what you do not possess and you are transgressing against the rights of others unlawfully. You are not entitled to anything of this house apart from your father's share of it. The same may be said concerning the house in which your paternal aunt is living; she is not entitled to anything of it apart from her share of her father's estate. To sum up: you have to work out your grandfather's estate and divide it among his heirs, who are your father and his four siblings. Beware of wrongdoing and consuming haraam wealth and living in an ill-gotten house, because that leads to grievous consequences and a bad end. We ask Allah to protect you and help you to restore rights to the people who are entitled to them. And Allah knows best."
483,Ruling on dyeing ones hair black for the purpose of beautification not to change grey hair,"Question I have read more than three fatwas on your site which say that it is haraam to dye the hair black, but the discussion is about dyeing grey hair or black hair. If a woman dyes her hair black at home for the purpose of beautification, is that also haraam? I have heard that the ruling is different if it is done for beautification. I hope that you can answer my question so that I may put my mind at rest for good, in sha Allaah.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: As the questioner mentioned, there is more than one answer which discusses dyeing the hair black for men and women. Please see the answers to questions no. 7227, 476 and 1008. Secondly: The ruling on dyeing the hair black is one of the well known issues in which there is a difference of scholarly opinion with regard to men. We have mentioned enough evidence in the answers mentioned above which shows that it is definitely haraam for men. Some scholars are of the view that this prohibition applies only to men, not women. But the correct view is that it is general and applies to both. This had been clearly explained in the answers mentioned above. Those who say that it is permissible for a woman to dye her hair black with the intention of beautifying herself for her husband have numerous reasons. Some of them regard it as permissible – in principle – for men, so they say it is permissible for women too. Some of them limit the prohibition to men only, such as al-Haleemi among the Shaafa’is. But some of the scholars who are of the view that the prohibition applies to both men and women regard it as permissible for a woman who is adorning herself for her husband to dye her hair black. They said: It is only forbidden if some deceit will result from that, which does not apply if a woman is dyeing her hair black for her husband. Among these scholars was Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh. The author of ‘Awn al-Ma’bood said (11/178): Most of the scholars are of the view that it is makrooh to dye the hair black, and al-Nawawi was of the view that it is makrooh in the sense of being haraam. Some of the scholars granted a concession in the case of jihad but not in other cases. Some of them made a distinction between men and women, and allowed it for women but not men. This was the view favoured by al-Haleemi. End quote. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Ishaaq also granted a concession with regard to that – i.e., dyeing the hair black – to a woman who is adorning herself for her husband. Al-Mughni (1/105) Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Others also granted a concession with regard to that – i.e., dyeing the hair black – to women who are adorning themselves for their husbands, but not to men. This is the view of Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh. It is as if he thought that the prohibition applies only to men. It is also allowed for women to dye their hands and feet (with henna) which is not allowed for men. Haashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ‘ala Tahdheeb Sunan Abi Dawood (11/173). The correct view is that the prohibition on dyeing the hair black is general and applies to both men and women. There should be no hesitation in saying that it is haraam to dye the hair black with the intention of cheating and deceiving people; if the intention is for a woman to adorn herself for her husband, it is better to avoid it. In the answer to question no. 47652 we said: It is better to be on the safe side and avoid that, because of the wording of the hadeeth and in accordance with it, especially since the reason mentioned – namely cheating and deception – is an implicit reason which some of the scholars stated was what was meant here, but it was not stated expressly by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). End quote. And Allaah knows best."
484,The reward for qiyaam al-layl,Question What is the reward for qiyaam al-layl?.,"Praise be to Allah.Qiyam al-layl is Sunnah mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah). Many texts of the Quran and Sunnah encourage it and speak of its high status and great reward. Qiyam al-layl plays a great role in strengthening one's faith and helping one to do good deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you wrapped in garments (i.e. Prophet Muhammad)! 2. Stand (to pray) all night, except a little — 3. Half of it or a little less than that, 4. Or a little more. And recite the Quran (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style. 5. Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word (i.e. obligations, laws). 6. Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah)” [al-Muzzamil 73:1-6] Allah praises those who have faith and are pious for their noble characteristics and good deeds, one of the most special of which is qiyam al-layl. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Only those believe in Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud. 16. Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah’s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. 17. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do” [al-Sajdah 32:15-17] Allah describes them elsewhere in the following terms (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, prostrate and standing. 65. And those who say: “Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily, its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.” 66. Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to rest in. 67. And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). 68. And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. 69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; 70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful. 71. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance. 72. And those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity. 73. And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat. 74. And those who say: “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqoon (the pious).” 75. Those will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise) because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. 76. Abiding therein excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in” [al-Furqaan 25:64-76] From this we may note the virtue of qiyam al-layl and its good consequences that cannot be ignored; it is one of the means of avoiding the punishment of Hell and attaining Paradise, and we may note the great blessing it brings of conversing with the Lord. May Allah make us among those who attain success thereby. Allah has described the pious in Soorat al-Dhaariyaat as having a number of characteristics – including praying qiyam al-layl – by means of which they attain Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the Muttaqoon (the pious) will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs (in the Paradise), 16. Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily, they were before this Muhsinoon (good‑doers). 17. They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Lord (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope]” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:15-17] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to pray qiyam al-layl in many ahaadeeth, such as the following: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best prayer after the obligatory prayer is prayer at night.” Narrated by Muslim, 1163. And he said: “You should pray qiyam al-layl, for it is the custom of the righteous who came before you and it brings you closer to your Lord, and expiates sins and prevents misdeeds.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3549; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 452. “The custom of the righteous” means it was their usual practise. “It brings you closer to your Lord” means, it is an act of worship by means of which one may draw closer to Allah. “and prevents misdeeds” means, it prevents one from committing sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) prevents from Al‑Fahsha’ (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al‑Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed)” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:45] It was narrated that ‘Amr ibn Murrah al-Juhani said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Qadaa’ah and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, what do you think if I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that you are His Messenger, and I pray the five daily prayers, and fast the month (of Ramadan), and pray qiyam in Ramadan, and pay zakaah?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies doing that will be one of the siddeeqs and martyrs.” Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Khuzaymah, 2212. Al-Tirmidhi (1984) narrated that ‘Ali said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are apartments the outside of which can be seen from the inside and the inside of which can be seen from the outside.” A Bedouin stood up and said: “Who are they for, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “They are for those who speak good words, feed others, fast regularly and pray to Allah at night when people are sleeping.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. Al-Haakim narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibreel came to me and said: ‘O Muhammad, live as long as you want, for you will die. Love whomever you want, for you will leave him. Do whatever you want for you will be requited for it. Remember that the believer’s honour is his praying at night, and his pride is his being independent of people.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 73. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays qiyam reciting ten verses will not be recorded as one of the negligent. Whoever prays qiyam reciting one hundred verses will be recorded as one of the devout. Whoever prays qiyam reciting one thousand verses will be recorded as one of the muqantireen.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1398; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. The muqantireen are those who will be given a qintaar of reward. A qintaar is a large amount of gold, and most of the scholars of Arabic language are of the view that it is four thousand dinars. And it was said that a qintaar is a bull’s hide full of gold, or eighty thousand, or a large but unspecified amount of wealth. See al-Nihaayah fi Ghareeb il-Hadeeth by Ibn al-Atheer. What is meant by this hadeeth is to emphasize the greatness of the reward earned by the one who recites a thousand verses. Al-Tabaraani narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A qintaar is better than this world and everything in it.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 638. Note: Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: From Soorat Tabaarak [al-Mulk] to the end of the Quran is one thousand verses. Whoever prays qiyam reciting from Soorat Tabaarak to the end of Quran has prayed qiyam with one thousand verses. And Allah knows best."
485,A mixed school is haraam according to sharee’ah,"Question I am a 16 yr old girl.I recently changed my school. Please could tou tell me how must i conduct myself in school.The girls to boys ratio is grossly unfair in this school.For eg in my chem class there are nearly 15 boys and only 3 girls!so sometimes when i need help with a ques or have an urgent doubt ihave to callup guys(vvvreluctantly).Moreover, since there are so few girls the guys are so frank with us. i spend about7hrs in school and i guess its not possible to not talk to anyone.Please let me know how should i behave in school .is it ok if i talk to guys or is it better that i not try be friendly with them?.","Praise be to Allah.Your attending a mixed school is haraam according to sharee’ah, because the mixing that you describe is exposing you to moral corruption and may be a means of causing you to commit sin. In many ahaadeeth, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned men against the fitnah (temptation) of women, and he indicated that the matter is so serious that their fitnah is the worst of fitnahs and the most harmful thing. It was narrated from Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I am not leaving behind me any fitnah more harmful to men than women.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4808; Muslim 2740 It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what about the in-law?’ He said, “The in-law is death.” Al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172 Ibn Hajar said, commenting on the first hadeeth: This hadeeth indicates that the fitnah caused by women is greater than any other fitnah. This is supported by the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women…” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:14] Allaah described them as being among the things that men covet, and He mentioned them first, before the other things, to indicate that they are the cause of the fitnah. We can see that a man is more inclined to love the children of a woman to whom he is still married than the children of a woman whom he has divorced. Fath al-Baari, 9/138 Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Undoubtedly allowing women to mix freely with men is the basis of all evils. This is one of the greatest causes of punishment coming down upon everyone and of public and private affairs becoming corrupt. Free mixing of men and women is the cause of much immorality and adultery, and it is the cause of general doom and diseases. … One of the greatest causes of general doom is the prevalence of adultery because of allowing women to mix freely with men and to walk amongst them making a wanton display of their beauty. If the powers that be knew how much corruption it causes to worldly interests and to people, they would prevent it most vigorously. Al-Turuq al-Hakamiyyah, p. 408 In the mixing that you describe, it is not possible to lower one's gaze and it provokes women to desire men and vice versa. This is not permissible; rather this is the thing that leads to corruption. If the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that for his own cousin (son of his paternal uncle) al-Fadl ibn al-‘Abbaas, when he was riding with him on his mount and they were performing one of the dearest acts of worship to Allaah, namely the Hajj, when Al-Fadl was in the company of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and at the time of the Sahaabah who were the most pious of people, then how can we allow the women of our own times, when diseases of the heart are widespread and religious commitment is at such a low level, to sit in the same place as men without a mahram, for so many hours every day? Fear Allaah, my sister, and do not go to this school, no matter how difficult that may be. We will quote to you the hadeeth of al-Fadl referred to above: It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Al-Fadl was the riding partner of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). A woman from (the tribe of) Kath’am came, and al-Fadl started looking at her and she started looking at him, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned al-Fadl’s face to the other side. She said, “O Messenger of Allaah, the command of Allaah enjoining Hajj upon His slaves has come when my father is an old man and is not steady on his mount; can I do Hajj on his behalf?” He said, “Yes.” That was the Farewell pilgrimage. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1442; Muslim, 1334. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadeeth: This hadeeth demonstrates the natural desire for women that is created in human beings, and what may be feared from looking at them. Al-Fadl ibn ‘Abbaas was one of the young men of Banu Haashim, and he was the most handsome man of his time, according to what they said. This also indicates that the ruler must prevent men and women from looking at one another. That includes preventing the women for whom there is no guarantee that they will not cause or be subject to temptation from walking in the streets and marketplaces and places where they can look at men. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I am not leaving behind me any fitnah more harmful to men than women.” And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)…” [al-Noor 24:31] This is sufficient for the one who ponders the meanings of the Book of Allaah and is guided to act upon it. Al-Tamheed, 9/123-124 There is no need for mixing. Studying in this school is not essential; so long as a woman can read and write and knows the teachings of her religion, that is sufficient, because she was created for that, i.e., to worship Allaah. Anything beyond that is not essential. And Allaah knows best."
486,Some rulings having to do with doctors and nurses,"Question I would like to know some of the rulings having to do with doctors and nurses, especially with regard to their work and interaction with patients.","Praise be to Allah.Doctors and their assistants, nurses and others, must adhere to Islamic obligations in all circumstances, and not be heedless concerning them. That includes the greatest pillar of Islam after the Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith), namely prayer. It is not permissible to neglect it or delay it until after the time for the prayer has ended, especially when there is work that may distract one and prevent one from praying, for the caller to evil (the Shaytaan) may put flimsy excuses and false arguments into one’s mind to justify one’s shortcomings. Prayer is not waived for the Muslim so long as he remains of sound mind, and it is not permissible to delay it until after the time for it has ended. There follow some other Islamic rulings which doctors and their assistants must know: 1. It is not permissible for men and women who are working to mix freely, for the evil of mixing is immense, and it poses a grave danger to the individual and to society. 2. The women who are working in hospitals, female doctors, nurses and others, should not beautify themselves either in their clothing or with perfume, because a woman’s wearing perfume and beautifying herself in front of men who are not her mahrams leads to many evils, as is well known. 3. Female workers in hospitals should not speak softly when they need to speak to men who are not their mahrams. Moreover it is not permissible for them to talk to them except from behind a screen and without mixing. It is well known that allocating separate, women-only wings which no men enter is possible, praise be to Allah. 4. Female workers should not display their charms and they should adhere to correct shar‘i hijab, by covering the entire body, including the face and hands. 5. It is haraam for male and female doctors, and their assistants, to look at ‘awrahs except in the case of necessity, when there is an urgent need for that. But no one should examine a man except another man, and no one should examine a woman except another woman, unless that is not possible and it is a case of necessity, in which case there is no blame on being examined by the opposite gender, whilst adhering to the Islamic guidelines thereon. So the doctor should not look at anything except the site of the problem, and it should be in the presence of a third person whose presence will ensure that there is no khulwah (seclusion). In the case of a female patient, it is essential that her wali (guardian) be present, if possible. 6. All hospital workers must refrain from disclosing patients’ secrets, and should adhere to confidentiality regarding such matters, because disclosing their secrets – in addition to being a betrayal of trust and a breach of confidentiality –leads to other evils as is well known. 7. All hospital workers must avoid imitating the disbelievers. The religious texts clearly indicate that that is prohibited. The Muslim should be proud of his religion and of belonging to it, and he should not be weak or feel inferior. And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions. End quote.

487,The difference between patience and contentment,"Question I am facing mistreatment from my husband’s family, meaning that they talk about me a great deal and sometimes tell others about my private matters, may Allah guide them and forgive them. By the grace of Allah, I am bearing their mistreatment with patience and seeking reward for that with Allah. But sometimes I feel very anxious and I feel that I can no longer put up with it, and I wish that I had never got to know these people. Even though my husband – praise be to Allah – fears Allah with regard to me, he lives abroad and I am living with his family, so it is inevitable that I will face problems. My question is: is my anxiety and my feeling that I can no longer put up with it contrary to patience? How can I reach the level of contentment, so that I can see the situation I am in as a blessing from Allah, because whatever He decrees is all good?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: You have done well in bearing with patience the harm caused by your husband’s family and seeking reward for that with Allah, may He be exalted. That is a high level of faith, and we ask Allah, may He be exalted, to reward you for it and to compensate you with something better. The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If a Muslim mixes with people and bears their harm with patience, that is better than the Muslim who does not mix with people and does not bear their harm with patience.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad (5002) and at-Tirmidhi (5307); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (39). Secondly: There is a difference between patience and contentment, both in terms of the definition and in terms of the ruling thereon. With regard to the ruling: patience is obligatory, meaning that a person is sinning if he does not bear with patience whatever he faces of troubles and problems, and he is exposing himself thereby to the punishment of Allah, may He be exalted. As for contentment, it is a higher level than patience; it is the level of those who are foremost in good deeds. Hence it is encouraged (mustahabb), but it is not obligatory, so the Muslim is not sinning if he does not attain it, but he is required to strive against his own self (nafs) and the Shaytaan until he attains that lofty status. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (10/682): Being content with calamities such as poverty, sickness and humiliation is recommended according to one of the two scholarly views, but it is not obligatory. It was also said that it is obligatory, but the correct view is that what is obligatory is patience. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to what may occur of calamities, it is recommended (mustahabb) to be content with them, according to most of the scholars, and it is not obligatory, but it is obligatory to bear them with patience. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (2/92). With regard to the difference between patience and contentment in terms of the definition: patience is what makes a person restrain himself from doing or saying something that is indicative of displeasure or resentment towards what Allah has decreed and what has befallen him of calamity. So the one who is patient restrains his tongue from objecting to the decree of Allah or complaining to anyone other than Allah, and he restrains himself from doing any action that is indicative of panic or lack of patience, such as slapping one’s cheeks, rending one’s garment, breaking things, striking one’s head against the wall, and so on. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in ‘Iddat as-Saabireen (p. 231): Patience is restraining one’s tongue from complaining to anyone other than Allah, restraining one’s heart from feeling resentment, and restraining oneself from slapping one’s cheeks, rending one’s garment, and so on. End quote. As for contentment, it is patience and more. The one who is content is patient, and in addition to this patience he is content with the decree of Allah, and is not distressed or pained by it. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Patience: even if a person feels a great deal of pain and is grieved by a calamity, he bears it with patience and controls his tongue, his actions and his emotions. His attitude is to say: “O Allah, reward me in my calamity and compensate me with something better than it” and “Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji‘oon (Indeed to Allah we belong and to Him we will return).” Contentment is when a calamity befalls a person and he is content with the decree of Allah. The difference between contentment and patience is that the one who is content does not feel pained by calamity at all, and he goes along with the divine decree. “If harm befalls him, he is patient, and that is good for him, and if something good happens to him, he is grateful, and that is good for him.” Thus he does not see any difference between one and the other, with regard to his acceptance of what Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, decrees. In other words, for the one who is content, the presence or absence of calamity is all the same to him. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (3/206). Thirdly: For a person to merely feel anxious and that he can no longer put up with something, and wishing that the hardship that has befallen him had never happened – all of that is not contrary to patience, so long as he controls his emotions, his tongue and his actions, and refrains from doing anything that is indicative of panic, and so long as he does not object to the decree of Allah, may He be exalted; rather he is usually patient and does not feel anything except that anxiety, hardship and exhaustion. As for the one who is content, he does not feel that anxiety and pain, because he knows that Allah, may He be exalted, will never choose for him anything except that which is good. So he goes along with whatever Allah chooses for him, with contentment and reassurance. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Patience, like its name, tastes bitter, but its consequences are sweeter than honey. A person may feel that this thing is burdensome for him and dislike it, but he puts up with it and shows patience, but whether it happens or does not happen is not the same for him; rather he dislikes it, but his faith protects him from complaining and feeling discontent. Contentment is of a higher level than that, for it is all the same to him (whether calamity occurs or not), as they are both the decree of Allah, although he may be saddened by the calamity. That is because he is a man who goes with the flow of the divine will and decree. Wherever the divine will and decree takes him, he will accept it, whether it takes him to a plain or a mountain, whether he goes through a time of ease or the opposite. It is all the same to him, not because his heart is deadened [and he feels no pain], but because he has attained the highest level of contentment with his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. He accepts whatever Allah decrees for him, for whatever happens to him, it is all the same to him, because in his view it is what his Lord has decreed. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (10/692). Fourthly: There is a higher level of contentment, which is the level of gratitude, meaning that a person thanks Allah, may He be exalted, for whatever befalls him of calamity and hardship. Thus he thinks that what has befallen him was a blessing from Allah, therefore he gives thanks for it. A person may attain the level of patience, then contentment, then gratitude by the following means: 1.. Looking at what Allah, may He be exalted, has chosen for him, and realizing that Allah will never choose anything for him except what is good. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it, and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim (2999). 2.. Reflecting on what has befallen him, for it is a means of expiating his sins, until he meets Allah, may He be exalted, pure and free of sins. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Calamity may continue to befall a believing man or believing woman in his own self, his children and his wealth, until he meets Allah with no sin on him.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sunan Saheeh at-Tirmidhi. 3.. Looking at what has befallen him and realizing that Allah, may He be exalted, was very gentle with him when that befell him, for how many people have been afflicted with that which is worse than it and greater? Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Fawaa’id (1/112-113), after mentioning patience and contentment: A person’s servitude to his Lord when calamities befall him dictates that he should bear them with patience, then be content with them, which is higher than patience. Then he should give thanks for them, which is higher than contentment. But he will only be able to achieve all of that if love of Allah is deeply rooted in his heart, and he realises that whatever Allah chooses for him is best for him, and that He was kind to him and gentle with him when He decreed this calamity for him, even if he dislikes the calamity. End quote. 4.. Looking at the consequences of trials and hardship, and realizing that Allah decrees such hardships which will make him remember Allah, may He be exalted, a great deal, call upon Him and humble himself before Him. 5.. Looking at the reward for patience and contentment: “Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account” [az-Zumar 39:10], and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Great reward comes with great calamity. Indeed, when Allah loves a people He tests them, then whoever is content will attain Allah’s good pleasure, and whoever is discontent will earn His wrath.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sunan Saheeh at-Tirmidhi. Allah’s being pleased with the person is greater than admittance to Paradise. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence; but approval from Allah is greater. It is that which is the great attainment” [at-Tawbah 9:72]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will say to the people of Paradise: O people of Paradise! They will say: Here we are at Your service, our Lord; all goodness is in Your hands. He will say: Are you pleased? They will say: How could we not be pleased, O Lord, when You have given us that which You have not given to anyone else among Your creation? He will say: Shall I not give you something even better than that? They will say: O Lord, what can be better than that? He will say: I bestow My pleasure upon you and I will never be angry with you after that.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6549) and Muslim (2829). Ibn al-Qayyim said in Tareeq al-Hijratayn (1/417), after mentioning something similar to these means that will help a person to attain contentment with the decree of Allah, may He be exalted: These and similar means are the causes that will enable a person to develop patience in the face of calamity, and if they become strongly rooted in him, they will develop further and lead to contentment and gratitude. End quote. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to make us among the patient, the content and the grateful. And Allah knows best."
488,Should she try to get her brother who belongs to Jamaa’at al-Tableegh married to her friend?,"Question I have read about jama’at at-tableegh on your website and in some other references. My opinion about it now is that I do not like to go out with them, and I like everyone to be careful about his religion. My question is: I would not like to marry a man who belongs to this group. If I try to get my brother who belongs to this group married to my friend, will I be opposing the hadeeth of the prophet : “No one of you truly believes until he likes for his brother what he likes for himself”? Bear in mind that I heard that some respectful scholars have stated that it is permissible to go out with this group such as sheikh Ben Jibreen.","Praise be to Allah.Jamaa’at al-Tableegh, like other da’wah groups, has its good points and is doing some good, but there are also some reservations about it. Its followers vary in their level of knowledge, understanding and soundness of method from one country or region to another. We have discussed this group previously in the answers to questions no. 8674, 14037 and 39349. Based on that, if your brother is religiously committed and of good character, and he follows the Sunnah and is cautious about bid’ah (innovation), then there is nothing wrong with your trying to get him married to your friend. But if you know that your brother is insisting on following bid’ah or he travels a great deal, and there is the fear that he may carry on with that after he gets married, which may have harmful effects on his wife and children, then you should not intervene to arrange his marriage, and in that case he should marry someone who is like him, so as to avoid arguments and disputes. And Allaah knows best."
489,The ruling on shaving a man’s chest,Question What is the ruling on shaving a man’s chest?.,"Praise be to Allah. Hair is of three types: 1 – That which sharee’ah commands us to leave alone and forbids us to remove any of it. 2 – That which sharee’ah commands us to remove. 3 – That concerning which sharee’ah says nothing; it does not tell us to remove it or forbid us to do so. That which sharee’ah commands us to leave alone is the beard and eyebrows, from which nothing should be removed. That which we are commanded to remove is armpit hair and pubic hair, and the moustache in the case of men. That concerning which sharee’ah says nothing is forgivable (and is the matter of personal choice), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What is halaal is that which Allaah has permitted in His Book, and what is haraam is that which Allaah has forbidden in His Book, and what He has remained silent about is forgivable.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1726; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. That includes hair in the nose, on the chest, and on the legs and arms. See question no. 9037. It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (18/100): With regard to shaving body hair in the case of a man, it is permissible according to the Maalikis, and it was said that it is Sunnah. What is meant by the body is everything except the head. With regard to shaving the head, we have discussed the ruling on that in detail in the answer to question no. 14051. And Allaah knows best."
490,"He thinks that he has been bewitched, but he does not want to ask for ruqyah so that he may be included in the hadith about the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being brought to account","Question A neighbour of ours is envious of us even though we show her respect and have never mistreated her, and she did witchcraft against us, by using some clothes of mine that had traces of my sweat. What is really strange is that I had seen her in my dream twice, pouring some kind of liquid over me that I did not know what it was, and I woke up in a panic, feeling afraid. We are a conservative family who love Islam, and we do whatever we can of righteous deeds, but we suffer from some problems and do not always get along, and we have a lot of troubles. Some time ago, I felt that something inside me had changed, and I was no longer happy, energetic and hard-working as I used to be. I began to get angry quickly, and to sleep all day and stay up at night, and I left two jobs for no reason. I can no longer control myself, and I feel as though someone is provoking me to do things. I feel tired and I am only 27 years old, and I have started to feel fed up. I have not been to see a raqi (one who does ruqyah) because I hope to enter Paradise among the seventy thousand who did not seek ruqyah. I tried to read Soorat al-Baqarah every day for forty days, but I could not do it. I tried several times, but every time I tried, I would see frightening dreams. I call upon Allah in my prayer, asking Him to cancel out this witchcraft. I feel that everyone in my family has been bewitched, and I do not know what to do; please advise me.","Praise be to Allah.The effect of magic or jinn possession on people is something real and cannot be denied, but the Muslim should not blame all the problems that happen to him in his life on witchcraft or jinn possession, thus living in a world of illusion and imagination that gets worse day after day. He should examine his situation first of all: obedience to Allah and His Messenger come first and foremost, and they are the means of attaining all that is good, whereas disobedience towards Allah is the cause of all evil. So the Muslim should strive to obey Allah and avoid disobeying Him, for the good life is only for the believers who do righteous deeds: Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do. [16:97]. And a life of misery and wretchedness is for those who turn away from the reminder or remembrance of Allah , may He be exalted: And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed life [Ta-Ha 20:124]. The more extreme the disobedience and turning away, the more severe that hardship and difficulty will be. After that comes taking positive measures, by looking for work and not being lazy, and bearing with patience some of what one experiences of difficulty in work and so on, until Allah, may He be exalted, helps him and grants him provision from where he does not expect. Similarly, with regard to what you mention about there being a lot of problems among the members of the family, each person should check himself and strive to acquire good characteristics, and try to be more patient and forbearing, and respond to mistreatment in the way that is better, and try to look for the causes of these problems, which are usually causes that do not deserve to be discussed. But if there are genuine causes, then it is essential to discuss them in a calm and loving atmosphere, so that you can overcome them. In addition to all of this, you should not refuse to go to a trustworthy raqi who can help you to overcome this witchcraft – if applicable. This is what we advise you to do. You should also be firmly resolved to read Soorat al-Baqarah, no matter how difficult that is for you. That is a very important part of the remedy and solution, which you should not ignore or fall short in, and then complain about witchcraft, hardship and problems, and so on. With regard to the hadith about the seventy thousand, those seventy thousand are not the best of people, and they will not be the highest of the people of Paradise in status. A person may be brought to account and enter Paradise, and be of a higher status than these seventy thousand, as was stated by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). These seventy thousand will not deserve that honour, which is admission to Paradise without being brought to account or being punished, because of refraining from asking for ruqyah only; rather they will deserve that because of their perfect Tawheed (affirmation of Allah’s Oneness) and their trust in Allah, may He be exalted. Perfect Tawheed and trust in Allah are their way of life in all their affairs. Moreover, asking for ruqyah is not haram (impermissible) or makrooh (disliked); rather some of the scholars stated, with regard to the meaning of the hadith, that the ruqyah that they did not seek or do in this case is the ruqyah of the Jahiliyyah (days of pre-Islamic ignorance) and incantations of the sorcerers, and so on. As for shar‘i ruqyah, which is done by reciting Quran, or by remembering Allah (dhikr), that is not forbidden, even if it is done at the request of the sick person. Al-Qastalani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They are the ones who did not seek ruqyah” i.e., they did not seek it at all, or they did not seek the ruqyah of the Jahiliyyah. End quote from Irshad as-Sari (9/271) See also: Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar (11/410). Based on this view, if a sick person seeks ruqyah, i.e., asks for shar‘i ruqyah, that will not exclude him from the seventy thousand. It is not wise for a person to refrain from seeking ruqyah so that he may be among the seventy thousand, then remain anxious, distressed, confused and worried, filled with doubts and lacking patience. None of these are attributes of the seventy thousand. Rather what you should do in your situation is go to a raqi and strive hard in obeying and worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, and avoid disobeying Him, in the hope that you will not be deprived of the virtue of the seventy thousand. If it so happens that you are not one of them, the grace of Allah is vast, and perhaps Allah will bless you with a status in Paradise that will compensate for what you missed out on of this particular virtue. May Allah, may He be exalted, help and guide you. And Allah knows best."
491,Eating fish and fries cooked in oil used for other meats etc.,"Question As-Salamu 'alaikum In many restaurants in the West, food such as fish, potato fries, chicken are fried in large deep fat fryers. The large fryer contains a large amount of oil. Is it permissible to eat fish and potato fries which have been cooked in this oil, if non-halaal meat and /or pork has also been fried in it ? And is it necessary to ask the shopkeeper whether he fries everything in the same oil, or should you not ask and just eat ? This is a real day to day problem affecting many Muslims living in the West. Jazakumullaahu khairan.","Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who replied as follows: So long as we know that most of the food cooked in it is impure, such as dead meat or pork, then we have to ask, but if we do not know that, then we do not need to ask. And Allaah knows best."
492,Making fun of some aspects of the Sunnah,"Question What is the ruling on making fun of the beard, short clothes and other aspects of the Sunnah? What is your opinion on those who, when these acts of worship are enjoined upon them, point to their hearts and say “Piety is here”?","Praise be to Allah. Making fun of the beard or clothes whose length etc. is in accordance with the Sunnah or other aspects of the Sunnah makes a person a kaafir, if he knows that this was proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because he is thereby making fun of the words and actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). In this case he is opposing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and making fun of his Sunnah, and the one who makes fun of the Sunnah and knowingly mocks things that are proven to be part of the Sunnah is not a Muslim. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: ‘Was it at Allaah, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?’ Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed” [al-Tawbah 9:65-66] If a person is called to observe one of the rulings of Islam and says that piety is in the heart but he does not follow the shar’i ruling, he is an evil liar. For faith includes both words and deeds, it is not simply the matter of what is in the heart. This view is the same as that of the evil innovators of the Murji’ah who restricted faith to the heart and said that it had nothing to do with outward actions. Moreover, if the heart is sound and filled with faith, that will be manifested in a person’s actions. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. Indeed it is the heart.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 52; Muslim, 1599). And he also said: “Allaah does not look at the outward appearance or wealth of any one of you; rather he looks at your hearts and deeds.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2564) Whatever the case, these words of those who stubbornly refuse to follow the truth and carry out the commands of Islam is a sign of their lack of faith by means of which they want to stop those who seek to call them to Islam and advise them."
493,Muslim's attitude towards the differences between various parties and groups,Question What should the Muslim's attitude be towards the differences that are widespread between various parties and groups?.,"Praise be to Allah. What he must do is adhere to the truth which is indicated by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him), and his friendship and enmity must be based on that. Any party or group that goes against the truth, he must disavow himself thereof and not agree with it. The religion of Allaah is one: it is the straight path, it is worship of Allaah alone and following His Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him). What every Muslim must do is adhere to this truth and follow it; it is obedience to Allaah and following His sharee’ah which was brought by His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him), being utterly sincere to Allaah in doing so and not devoting any act of worship to anyone other than Him, may He be glorified and exalted. Every group that goes against this and every party that does not adhere to this belief, he must distance himself therefrom and disavow himself of it and call its people to the truth on the basis of shar’i evidence and with kindness, and he should seek out useful means of doing so to show the truth to them clearly.

494,What to Recite in Sujud As-Sahw,Question What should we say in Sujud As-Sahw (forgetfulness during the prayer)?,"Praise be to Allah.What is to be said in Sujud As-Sahw is the same as what is to be said in the sujud of prayer, which is to say Subhana Rabbi al-A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High) or other tasbihat which are reported as being sunnah to say in sujud. Other du`as which are sunnah to say in sujud may also be recited. There is no specific mention of how the tasbih should be said in Sujud As-Sahw . The author of Al-Sunan wal-Mubtada’at said: “There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said any specific words in Sujud As-Sahw ; the adkhar to mentioned in Sujud As-Sahw are the same as those to be recited in the sujud of prayer. As regards the belief that one should say Subhan man la yas-hu wa la yanam (Glory be to the One Who does not forget or sleep), neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor the Sahabah did this, and there is no evidence for it in the Sunnah. (Pp. 74-75) And Allah knows best."
495,Can the person praying behind the imam read something from the Mushaf other than what the imam is reciting?,"Question I pray behind the imam in Taraweeh prayers, but after saying ameen and reciting al-Faatihah, I read from the Mushaf that is in my hand, for my own completion of the Qur’aan, then I follow the imam in the rest of the prayer. Is it permissible for me to read from the Mushaf after al-Faatihah, knowing that I am reading a different soorah than the imam?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: What the person praying behind the imam should do is to recite al-Faatihah then listen attentively to the recitation of his imam. It is not permissible for him to recite anything more than al-Faatihah, whether he recites it from memory or from the Mushaf. Allaah has commanded worshippers and others to listen attentively when the Qur’aan is recited to them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Qur’aan is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A’raaf 7:204] A similar command was issued by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The imam has been appointed to be followed, so when he says takbeer, then say takbeer, and when he recites, then listen attentively.” Narrated by Muslim, 404. No exception is made from that apart from the recitation of al-Faatihah only. It was narrated that ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We were behind the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Fajr prayer, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited and the recitation became difficult for him. When he had finished he said: “Perhaps you were reciting behind your imam?” We said: Yes, that is so, O Messenger of Allaah. He said: “Do not do that, except for the Opening of the Book (al-Faatihah), for there is no prayer for the one who does not recite it.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 823; classed as saheeh by Shaykh Ibn Baaz in his Fataawa, 11/221. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible for the one who is praying behind the imam in a prayer in which Qur’aan is recited out loud to recite anything more than al-Faatihah, rather after that he must remain silent and listen attentively to the recitation of the imam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Perhaps you were reciting behind your imam?” We said: Yes, that is so, O Messenger of Allaah. He said: “Do not do that, except for the Opening of the Book (al-Faatihah), for there is no prayer for the one who does not recite it.” And because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Qur’aan is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy”, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When he recites, then listen attentively.” With regard to the exception that is made with regard to al-Faatihah only, that is because of the hadeeth quoted above, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book.” Saheeh – agreed upon. End quote. Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 11/234 Secondly: In the answer to question no. 52876 , it says that the person who is praying behind the imam should not hold the Mushaf behind his imam, and that holding it is contrary to the Sunnah. This applies if he is following the recitation of his imam. But if he is carrying the Mushaf and reading something other than what his imam is reciting, then this is haraam, as stated above, because it is not permissible for the person who is praying behind the imam in a prayer in which Qur’aan is recited out loud to recite anything more than al-Faatihah. And Allaah knows best."
496,He suffers from too many wet dreams; he wakes up and finds wetness but he does not remember having a dream,"Question About five years ago, I started suffering from ejaculation and it makes my life difficult. When I wake up I find wetness but I do not remember that I had a wet dream. I might make ghusl to clear the impurity of a wet dream one night, and I find wetness next day. Do I have to make ghusl every time I find wetness? This might happen twice weekly. What is the solution for my problem?.","Praise be to Allah.If a person wakes up and finds some wetness, one of three scenarios must apply: 1- He is certain that it is maniy, in which case he must do ghusl, whether he remembers having an erotic dream or not. 2- He is certain that it is not maniy, in which case he does not have to do ghusl, but he should wash whatever it got onto, because it comes under the same ruling as urine. 3- He does not know whether it is maniy or not. This is subject to further discussion: (i) If he remembers having an erotic dream whilst he slept, he should regard it as maniy and do ghusl, because of the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a woman who sees in her dream what a man sees – does she have to do ghusl? He said: “Yes, if she sees water.” This indicates that it is obligatory to do ghusl for one who has an erotic dream and sees water (wetness). (ii) If he did not see anything in his dream, if his sleep was preceded by thoughts of intercourse, he should regard it as madhiy. If his sleep was not preceded by such thoughts then there is a difference of scholarly opinion. Some said that he should do ghusl so as to be on the safe side. And some said that he does not have to do ghusl, which is the correct view, because the basic principle is that a person is as he originally was. End quote from Fataawa al-Tahaarah by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), p. 221. The fuqaha’ have stated that the smell of wet maniy is like the smell of dough or the pollen of date palms, and the smell of dry maniy is like the smell of egg whites. Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha (1/162). It makes no difference whether that happens once or twice a week or more. Every time you experience a wet dream you must do ghusl. You should not get worried because this happens, because the reason for it may be that this is the nature of the body, or some kinds of food, and so on. And Allaah knows best."
497,Prayer rooms (musallas) in houses and businesses do not come under the same rulings as mosques,"Question I work in Saudi and I have accommodation for the workers, in which approximately 50 workers live. In the building there is a prayer room in which four of the five daily prayers are held, because the fifth obligatory prayer comes during regular work hours, and the workers pray it outside. My question is: I want to use the space of the prayer room to build extra rooms for accommodation. Before doing that, I will of course prepare another place as a prayer room. Please note that the new place will also be inside the building and will only be 15 meters or so from the old place. Is there any prohibition on turning the musalla into other kinds of rooms?.","Praise be to Allah.Prayer rooms that are built in houses or in some institutions and businesses, with the intention that only the people who live and work in those places will pray in them, and which are not intended as public mosques that are open to all Muslims, do not come under the same rulings as mosques. In olden times, the practice was that a man would set aside a place in his house for prayer, which was called musalla al-bayt (the prayer room of the house) or masjid al-bayt (the mosque of the house), but this “mosque” did not come under the well-known rulings on mosques. Al-Bukhaari (425) and Muslim (33) narrated from ‘Itbaan ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that when he became blind and it was too difficult for him to go to the mosque on rainy days and when there were floods, he asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to come to his house and pray in a spot that ‘Itbaan could take as a musalla. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) responded to his request. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: One of the things that we learn from this hadeeth is that setting aside a place in the house for prayer does not mean that it becomes a waqf, even if it is called a mosque. End quote. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (4/464): The “mosque” in a house does not come under the real rulings on mosques. End quote. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (2/121): A mosque in the house is not a mosque in the real sense and does not come under the same rulings, so it is permissible to change it and for a person who is in a state of janaabah to sleep in it. End quote. Based on this, this prayer room in the house does not come under the same rulings as a mosque and there is nothing wrong with turning it into rooms for accommodation. It should be noted that offering prayers in congregation is obligatory and is to be done in the mosque; it is not permissible to offer these prayers at home, even if it is done in congregation, except in the case of one who has an excuse, such as if he is sick or the mosque is too far away, and the like. For more information please see the answer to question number 72895. And Allah knows best."
498,It is not permissible for women to wear shoes that look like men’s shoes,"Question Recently there have appeared in the marketplace women's shoes which from the front look like men’s shoes, sandals with a separate space for the big toe, but from the back and the bottom they look like women's shoes. Is it permissible to buy them and wear them?","Praise be to Allah.If they look like men’s shoes, and if a person sees them he will think that they are men’s shoes, then it is not permissible for women to wear them. Similarly, if a man were to find shoes which looked like women’s shoes although the soles and heels looked like men’s shoes, it would not be permissible for him to wear them, because what counts is the way things look. My advice to my sisters is not to wear them, because this is a serious matter. It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men."
499,Can they take the diyah (blood money) for the deceased loved one from the insurance company?,"Question In our country the state requires car insurance, but the owner does not benefit from it at all. If the car hits a person and this accident leads to him being injured or dying, his family refer the case to the insurance company and this leads to the family of the person who has been injured or killed receiving compensation. This compensation does not affect the owner of the car in any way, whether positive or negative. What is the ruling on that? Please note that the family of the deceased have forgiven the owner of the car and the state is ruled by manmade laws.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Commercial insurance is a forbidden kind of contract, and it is haraam in all forms. It is not permissible for anyone to participate in it unless he is forced to do so. We have explained the ruling on this in the answer to question no. 8889 . Secondly: The fact that it is haraam to participate in insurance does not mean that it is haraam to take one's rights from the insurance company if it is required to pay to someone who has been affected by an accident. Based on this, there is no reason why one should not take the diyah for one who has been killed by accident or injured in an accident from whatever entity the those who are entitled to it have been referred, whether by the killer or the court, whether it is an insurance company or otherwise, because those who are entitled to the diyah are people who have a right, and they are not responsible for the other party’s dealings with the insurance company. We asked Shaykh Ibn Jibreen about taking compensation from the insurance company and he replied: That is permissible, because these companies are committed to bearing costs incurred by the one who is insured with them, and there is no reason to refrain from doing that so long as they are obliged to pay compensation. All that the one who caused the accident has to do – in the case of a death – is offer the expiation for accidental killing, if the accident was caused by a mistake on his part. And Allaah knows best."
