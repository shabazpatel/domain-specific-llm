What is the ruling if the two witnesses did not hear the woman giving her consent to the marriage?,"Question I entered Islam, and when I gave my consent to my wali (guardian) to represent me in my marriage contract, that was by telephone, and in front of two witnesses who were men, but they did not hear the conversation. Is this marriage valid? Because my husband and I have had intercourse, believing that the marriage was valid. If it is not, then is it permissible for me to repeat the marriage contract with him?","Praise be to Allah. In order for the marriage to be valid, it is stipulated that the marriage contract should be done by the woman’s guardian, and that it should be witnessed by two Muslim male witnesses, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a guardian.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (2085), at-Tirmidhi (1101) and Ibn Maajah (1881), from the hadith of Abu Moosa al-Ash‘ari; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi. And he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a guardian and two witnesses of good character.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi from the hadith of ‘Imraan and ‘Aa’ishah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 7557. The woman’s guardian is her father, then her father’s father, then her son (if she has one), then her full brother, then her brother through her father, then the son of her full brother, then the son of her brother through her father, then her paternal uncle, then his son, then the Muslim ruler. Al-Mughni (9/355) If the woman is a Muslim, it is stipulated that her guardians should also be Muslim. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to a disbeliever, he has no guardianship over a Muslim woman under any circumstances, according to the consensus of the scholars, including Maalik, ash-Shaafa‘i, Abu ‘Ubayd and as-haab ar-ra’y. Ibn al-Mundhir said: Those scholars from whom we acquired knowledge unanimously agreed on this point. End quote from al-Mughni (9/377) Based on that, if your guardian is a Muslim, then the condition of having a guardian was fulfilled. But if he was not Muslim, then the marriage contract is not valid, and must be repeated at the hands of your Muslim guardian, if you have one. If you do not have one, then the Muslim judge must do your marriage contract, if there is a Muslim judge; otherwise it may be done by the director of the Islamic centre or someone of similar standing among the Muslims. If no such person is available, then a Muslim man of good character may do your marriage contract. With regard to witnesses, what is meant is that the marriage contract must be witnessed by two Muslim witnesses who are present at the marriage contract that is done between the guardian and the suitor. Everyone who is present at the marriage contract, such as a scribe, relative, official and so on is a witness to it, if he is fit to be a witness, i.e., he is a Muslim of good character. Many of the scholars are of the view that if the marriage is publicised widely and announced, there is no need for there to be witnesses, because of the report narrated by Ahmad from ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Publicise the marriage.” This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel no. 1993. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Undoubtedly marriage that is publicised widely is valid, even if it is not witnessed by two witnesses. But if it is done in secret and with witnesses, this is something that is subject to further discussion. If it is both witnessed and widely publicised, then there is no dispute that it is valid. If there are no witnesses and it is not widely publicised, then it is invalid according to the majority of scholars, and if there is any differing opinion it is insignificant. End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 177 See also the answers to questions no. 124678 and 112112 Based on that, if these two witnesses witnessed the marriage contract, or the marriage was widely publicised and announced, then your marriage is valid; if that was not the case, then you must do a new marriage contract. And Allah knows best."
Ruling on voting in contests and competitions for someone about whom one knows nothing,"Question What is the ruling on voting for someone in a scientific field when I do not know him, and I do not know anything about his work for which I am voting for him, such as voting for some achievement such as research, or a knowledge challenge in education at the national level, when they say vote for this or that student?","Praise be to Allah.Voting for someone is a kind of testimony and praise, so the vote should be based on truth, which can only be based on knowing the person and the field in which he is competing, and whether he deserves to be given precedence over someone else. As for voting for someone whom you do not know, and you do not know anything about his work, let alone whether he deserves to be promoted, that is not permissible; it is a betrayal of trust, giving false testimony, and deceiving the organization that is asking people to vote. In most cases the motivation for doing that is a kind of tribal feeling for a country or race. All of that is blameworthy and leads to giving promotion to those who do not deserve it. Al-Bukhaari (5976) and Muslim (87) narrated that Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of the worst of major sins?” We said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Associating others with Allah, defiantly disobeying one’s parents –” he was lying down, but he sat up and said: “and false speech and bearing false witness, and false speech and bearing false witness” – and he kept on saying it until I thought that he never fall silent. [This was out of compassion, for fear that he would exhaust himself in his fervour]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives us is not one of us.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, no. 101. Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Some sisters send messages asking us to vote for their relatives who are taking part in a competition for work. They ask us to vote, when we have not seen his work and are not present at the competition. He replied: No, it is wrong. If you vote for him and support him, and say such and such, then you are speaking untruthfully, and you are lying. End quote from the shaykh’s website. And Allah knows best."
She is sad because she is unmarried and is asking for advice,"Question Sheikh, I am 29 years old, I have not married yet. I always ask Allah to bless me with a righteous husband who helps me religiously and in life. I am sure that Allah will answer my prayer soon. I know all the preferable times of making dua. My problem is that I feel that every act worship I do is being done for the sake of answering my prayer. I fast because the dua of a fasting person will be answered, I pray late at night because making dua while praying late at night is accepted, I pray the sunan so that I become closer to Allah that He accepts my dua. In brief; I feel that all my worship is not purely for the sake of Allah, and this feeling suffocates me. What shall I do? Another thing is I am very tired because of remaining unmarried, I keep asking Allah knowing that He is the most generous, most bounteous, but I fear my sins, I fear my dua is not being answered because of my sins, what shall I do? Please sheikh, advise me and make dua for me. Please, please, ask Allah to bless me with a righteous husband, better than I deserve. May Allah reward you and bless you with the highest paradise.","Praise be to Allah. Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good” [al-Nisa’ 4:19] “and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know” [al-Baqarah 2:216]. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: I was riding behind the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) one day and he said: “O boy, I shall teach you some words. Be mindful Allaah and He will take care of you. Be mindful of Allaah and He will protect you. If you ask then ask of Allaah, and if you seek help then seek help from Allaah. Know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you in some way, they would not benefit you except in something that Allaah has decreed for you, and if they were to gather together to harm you in some way, they would not harm you except in something that Allaah has decreed for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2516). You should note that what you have to do is to be content with your situation and realize that what Allaah has chosen for you is the best, and you missing out on something may be a good thing. Do not let the whispers of the accursed shaytaan affect you and lead you every which way. Rather you should be as our Lord likes you to be, and accept His decree and thank Him for His blessings. Ponder the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon you, and do not worry. Keep yourself busy with worship of Allaah and make a program for yourself so that you can wake up for Fajr prayer and then read Qur’aan and adkhaar and du’aas. Attend lectures and reminders and Islamic conferences. Through this program you will be able to relax and find peace of mind. Always comfort yourself with the words of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) “How wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This does not apply to anyone but the believer.” Narrated by Muslim (2999). Be kind to yourself, and remember that there are millions of women like you who are not married, but many of them may be happier than many of those who are married. May Allaah open your heart to contentment with His decree and give you peace of mind about your situation, and fill your heart with happiness. You are better off than many others! Does your sorrow at not being married increase when you see a woman and her husband and children going on a trip? Does this remind you that you are alone and without a husband and children? Does it make you feel that you have been wronged, or that you are unfortunate, or that you are deprived? Wait a minute, do not let these negative feelings and frustrations prevail over you and increase your sense of sadness and sorrow. You have seen only one aspect of this family’s life, but there are many other aspects that you have not seen. Perhaps if you saw the wife who has a hard-hearted husband who shows no compassion, and you heard her complaints about her continual suffering with him, you would praise Allaah for saving you from marriage. If you sit with a divorced woman who laments her fate and says that she regrets having married, and you listen to her as she complains about how much she put up with and how much she suffered until she got her divorce, and regained her sense of security, perhaps you will praise Allaah for not having got married and suffered what she has suffered. If you think about what thousands of wives are suffering and what may others whose marriages ended in divorce have had to put up with, this will reduce many of the feelings of regret that you have because of not being married. This way of thinking will dispel your feeling of having been hard done by, and will replace those feelings with a beautiful sense of contentment, which will earn you the pleasure of Allaah, as I told you in the previous message. Remember your friend’s complaints about her husband yelling and being angry all the time, and how you have been saved from that. Remember your neighbour who left her home weeping after her husband beat her and hurt her. “I have reached my forties and am not married, and I praise Allaah for everything that He has decreed for me. At first I felt sad and upset whenever I was alone, and I regretted my misfortune every time one of my friends got married. I did not have any conditions or specific characteristics in the man I wanted to marry; I was prepared to accept any righteous man. But years went by without this man coming to me. I began to withdraw from people so that I would not see their looks of pity but I could not escape them completely, because I would see them in the eyes of my parents and siblings who would pray for me every time they saw me. One day at the end of Sha’baan, as we were preparing for the blessed month of Ramadaan, Allaah guided me to keep a Mus-haf just for myself. I decided to read the whole Qur’aan and I found it very difficult to read it because I had stopped reading for the last ten years. I also found it difficult to understand some verses, so I bought a book of Tafseer (commentary) and I started to read it so that I could understand the verses of Qur'aan that I was reading. Ramadaan ended but my attachment to the Book of Allaah did not stop; I carried on reading the verses of Allaah and reading the commentary thereon. “Then came the day when I read the verse in Soorat al-Kahf (interpretation of the meaning): Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the good righteous deedsthat last, are better with your Lord for rewards and better in respect of hope [al-Kahf 18:46]. I wondered, what does the good righteous deedsthat last’ mean? I found in the Tafseer that it refers to all righteous deeds. “I fell in love with righteous deeds such as prayer, fasting, charity, tasbeeh, tahmeed, tahleel and takbeer. Happiness began to fill my heart and I became content. I praised Allaah greatly for guiding me to this path and teaching me these things.” Sister Umm Yamaan adds: “But this is not a call for monasticism, rather it is a call to accept the will and decree of Allaah.” Ghayr Mutazawwajaat walakin Sa’eedaat (Unmarried but Happy) 1/4-7 by Muhammad Rasheed al-‘Uwayd. But every girl should understand that the purpose of life is to be a true slave of Allaah in both the specific and general senses. If she has the opportunity to establish a Muslim household, then the girl will be worshipping Allaah by getting married and raising children, and raising for us the generation that we want. But if that does not happen, then the ways of worshipping Allaah in general are many, foremost among which is calling people to Allaah. So she should focus on women who have deviated from the path of Allaah and take them as her daughters and guide them to the straight path of Allaah. “The one who calls people to guidance will have a reward equal to theirs, without it detracting from their reward in the slightest.” So regard the Muslim community as your home, and be like a beacon of guidance, truth, justice and knowledge, and let us advise one another to adhere to truth and patience. “Surely, Allaah wastes not the reward of the Muhsinoon [those who do good]” [al-Tawbah 9:120].

How did the Sahaabah turn around during their prayer when news reached them that the qiblah had been changed?,"Question I am a little confused, because when I was in Madinah, I visited Masjid al-Qiblatayn. There was a brother who explained to us how the Sahaabah turned around when news reached them that the qiblah had been changed, and he showed us how the imam turned around, and said that he cut through the rows of worshippers, and they also turned around. My question is: after the imam changed his qiblah and turned around, what did the women at the back do? Did they also turn around, or did they interrupt their prayer, or did they stay as they were? Is there any proven, saheeh story in the first place about the way in which the qiblah was changed?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The story of the change of the qiblah from Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) to al-Masjid al-Haraam (Makkah) is proven in the Qur’an, and is also proven in some detail in the Prophet’s Sunnah. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “The fools (pagans, hypocrites, and Jews) among the people will say, ‘What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah (prayer direction (towards Jerusalem)) to which they were used to face in prayer?’ Say, (O Muhammad SAW) ‘To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a Straight Way.’ Thus We have made you (true Muslims - real believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad SAW and his Sunnah (legal ways)), a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) be a witness over you. And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allah guided. And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind. Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad’s SAW) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid- al-Haram (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka‘bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.” [al-Baqarah 2:142-144]. Al-Bukhaari (41) narrated from al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) first came to Madinah, he stayed with his grandfathers or his maternal uncles among the Ansaar, and he prayed facing towards Bayt al-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months. But he wanted his qiblah to be towards the Ka‘bah. The first prayer he offered (after the qiblah was changed) was ‘Asr prayer, and some people prayed with him. Then one of the men who had prayed with him went out and passed by some people who were praying in a mosque, and they were bowing. He said: I bear witness by Allah that I (just) prayed with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) facing towards Makkah. And they turned around, as they were, to face towards the Ka‘bah. The Jews and the People of the Book used to like it when he prayed facing towards Bayt al-Maqdis, and when he turned to face towards the Ka‘bah, they did not like that. Muslim (527) narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray towards Bayt al-Maqdis, then it was revealed: “Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad’s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah)” [al-Baqarah 2:144]. A man passed by Banu Salamah whilst they were bowing in Fajr prayer, and they had prayed one rak'ah. He called out: The qiblah has been changed, and they turned as they were towards the qiblah. Muslim also narrated (526) that Ibn ‘Umar said: Whilst the people were praying Fajr in Quba’, someone came to them and said: Revelation came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) last night and he was commanded to face towards the Ka‘bah, so face towards it. They were facing towards Syria, so they turned to face the Ka‘bah. Secondly: With regard to the manner in which the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) turned around whilst they were praying when news reached them that the qiblah had been changed, it was as follows: The imam turned around, and those who were with him shifted from their places in a half circle, so that the imam shifted the back of the mosque, on the side closest to the Ka‘bah, and the men ended up behind him, and the women ended up where the men had been originally. The word translated as turned around in the hadeeths quoted above does not mean that the imam cut through the rows; rather it may be understood that what happened was simply that he shifted. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: An explanation of how they turned around is given in the hadeeth of Thuwaylah bint Aslam, which was narrated by Ibn Abi Haatim, and I said something similar. She said: The women moved to the men’s place, and the men moved to the women’s place, and we prayed the last two rak‘ahs facing towards the Sacred House (the Ka‘bah). I say: To give a vivid image of what happened, the imam shifted from his place at the front of the mosque to the back of the mosque, because the one who faces towards the Ka‘bah [in Madinah] will have Bayt al-Maqdis at his back. If he had turned around on the spot, there would not have been enough room behind him for the rows of worshippers. When the imam shifted, the men also shifted until they were behind him, and the women shifted until they were behind the men. This requires a great deal of movement in the prayer; it is possible that this happened before the prohibition on moving a great deal in the prayer, and it probably also happened before the prohibition on talking during the prayer. Or it may be understood as meaning that the actions mentioned were overlooked because of the great significance of the matter in question. Or it may be that when they shifted, they did not move all in one go; rather it was a gradual shifting. And Allah knows best. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 1/506-507 See also: Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/167, 470 Thirdly: Visiting the “seven places” (or the “seven mosques”) in Madinah with the intention of worship and attaining reward is not prescribed in Islam. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the seven mosques, Masjid al-Qiblatayn, and other places that are mentioned by some writers as places to be visited as part of the rituals, there is no basis or evidence for that. What is prescribed for the believer at all times is to follow and not innovate. End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 6/321 For more information, please see the answer to question no. 11669.

He wants to delay making up Ramadan fasts until winter because the days are shorter,"Question What is the ruling on making up missed Ramadan fasts in winter when, as we know, the days are short?.","Praise be to Allah.The one who does not fast some days in Ramadan is obliged to make them up before the next Ramadan comes, whether that is in the winter or otherwise, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:184]. And it is proven that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) had days to make up, but she did not make them up until Sha‘baan came because of the status of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions. End quote."
The Muslims are required by sharee’ah to be united in starting and ending the fast – and how that may be achieved,Question Why are the Muslims not united with regard to the beginning and end of Ramadaan? How can that be achieved?.,"Praise be to Allah. Undoubtedly for the Muslims to be united in starting and ending the fast is something desirable and it is something that is required by sharee’ah wherever possible, and there are only two conditions of achieving that: 1 –All Muslim scholars should do away with relying on calculations as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the early generations of this ummah did, and follow moonsighting or completing the number of days (in the month) as was explained by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the saheeh ahaadeeth. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa (25/132, 133) that the scholars were unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to rely on calculations for proving the beginning and end of the fast and so on. Al-Haafiz narrated in al-Fath (4/127) that al-Baaji said: The consensus of the salaf is that calculations should not be relied on, and their consensus is proof for those who come after them. 2 – They should commit to following the sighting of the moon in any Muslim state that follows the sharee’ah of Allaah and adheres to its rulings. When it is proven in that country that the new moon has been sighted with shar’i proof, with regard to the beginning or end of the fast, then they should follow that, in accordance with the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Fast when you see it, and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is too cloudy then complete the number (of days)” and “We are an unlettered nation, we do not write or calculate. The month is such-and-such” and he gestured with his hands three times, and held down his thumb the third time, then he said, “or the month is such-and-such” and he gestured with all of his fingers, meaning that the month may be twenty-nine days or it may be thirty. There are many ahaadeeth with similar meanings, from Ibn ‘Umar, Abu Hurayrah, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan and others (may Allaah be pleased with them). It is well known that what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said was not addressed only to the people of Madeenah, rather it is addressed to the entire ummah at all times and in all places until the Day of Resurrection. When these two conditions are met, then all Muslim countries will be able to fast together and break the fast together, and we ask Allaah to enable them to do that and to help them to rule by Islamic sharee’ah and reject that which goes against it. Undoubtedly that is obligatory upon them because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission” [al-Nisa’ 4:65] And there are similar verses. There is also no doubt that ruling all their affairs in accordance with sharee’ah is in their best interests and will unite them and help them against their enemies and help them to attain happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. We ask Allaah to open their hearts to that and to help them to achieve it, for He is All-hearing, Ever-near. End quote. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him)."
Can they get married and agree not to be intimate until their financial situation improves?,Question If a brother happens to see a sister he likes and both of them decided to do aqidui nikkah.both of them knowing that the brother is still in school and he does not have the means to provide for the sister yet and both of them agree that they will not come to each other sexually till they are financialy okay enough to raise a family.is it allowed in islam .,"Praise be to Allah. Marriage is one of the means of obtaining provision, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid‑servants (female slaves). If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All‑Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All‑Knowing (about the state of the people)” [al-Noor 24:32] al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “those among you who are single” refers to those who have no spouse, men and women. And he said: “If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty” means: do not refrain from getting married because the man or the woman is poor. If they are poor, Allaah will make them independent of means by His bounty. This is a promise of independence of means to those who get married, seeking the pleasure of Allaah and seeking to protect themselves from sin. Ibn Mas’ood said: Seek independence of means through marriage, and he recited this verse. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I am surprised by those who do not seek independence of means through marriage, when Allaah has said, “If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.” Something similar was also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him). Al-Qurtubi also said: This verse indicates that the poor man should get married, and he should not say, How can I get married when I have no wealth? For his provision comes from Allaah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave in marriage a woman who came to offer herself to him, to a man who hadnothing but a single izaar (waist-wrapper). End quote from Tafseer al-Qurtubi (12/218). And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three who are all entitled to Allaah’s help: the one who fights for the sake of Allaah; the mukaatab who wants to pay (the price of his freedom); and the one who gets married seeking chastity.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1579), al-Nasaa'i (3166) and Ibn Maajah (2509). This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. If this young man is going to do the marriage contract, and his wife is going to stay in her father’s house until they can afford to set up home together, there is nothing wrong with that. But he has to look for work so that he can spend on himself, his wife and his house, so that his wife and her family will not be adversely affected if it takes too long. If what is meant is that his wife will move to his house but they have agreed not to be intimate, so that they will not have children at this stage, that is not appropriate for several reasons: 1-Refraining from intimacy means missing out on something that is one of the most important aims of marriage, which is having children. 2-Refraining from having children for fear of poverty is contrary to putting one’s trust in Allaah, and it is an imitation of the people of Jaahiliyyah who used to kill their children for fear of poverty. Allaah has guaranteed to give provision for every soul, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus or grave). All is in a Clear Book (Al‑Lauh Al‑Mahfûz — the Book of Decrees with Allaah)” [Hood 11:6] “And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:22] But we must point out two things: 1 – With regard to marriage, it is essential that the conditions be fulfilled, which is the consent of both parties and that there be no legal impediments such as their being mahrams (relatives to whom marriage is forbidden) or their being related through breastfeeding. The woman’s wali (guardian) and two witnesses must also be present, otherwise the marriage is not valid. 2 – It is not permissible for a man and woman to form a relationship before marriage, because of the many negative consequences to which that will lead, such as falling in love, sickness of the heart (because of sin), looking at one another, being alone together, speaking softly to one another and other things that Allaah has forbidden. And Allaah knows best."
It is better not to buy in installments if you are able to pay in cash,Question Is it permissible for me to buy something by installments when I am able to pay for it in cash? Please note that the price when bought in installments is greater than the price if I pay in cash.,"Praise be to Allah.We have already stated in the answer to question no. 13973 that selling something by installments for a higher price is permissible. Although it is permissible, we should not be too lax on this matter, especially if there is no need for it, because buying by installments means buying with debt, and we should not be too lax when it comes to taking loans; rather we should not seek loans unless there is a need for it and it is essential. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allaah from debt. Al-Bukhaari (833) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to make du’aa’ in his prayer and say, “Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min ‘adhaab il-qabr, wa a’oodhu bika min fitnat il-maseeh il-dajjaal, wa a’oodhu bika min fitnat il-mahya wa fitnat il-mamaat; Allaahumma inni a’oodhi bika min al-ma’tham wa’l-maghram (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of the grave; I seek refuge with You from the fitnah of the Dajjaal; I seek refuge with You from the trials of life and death; O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from sin and debt).” Someone said to him, “How often you seek refuge with Allaah from debt!” He said, “If a man gets into debt, he speaks and lies, he makes a promise then breaks it.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to call on people to pay off debts. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also used to say in his du’aa’: “Allaahumma anta al-awwal fa laysa qablaka shay’un, wa anta al-aakhir fa laysa ba’daka shay’un, wa anta al-zaahir fa laysa fawqaka shay’un, wa anta al-baatin fa laysa doonaka shay’un, iqdi ‘anna al-dayn wa aghnina min al-faqr (O Allaah, You are the First and there is nothing before You, You are the Last and there is nothing after You, You are the Most High and there is nothing above You, and You are the Most Near and there is nothing closer than You. Settle our debt for us and spare us from poverty).” Hence no one should buy by installments when he is able to pay the whole price immediately, because then he is getting into debt when he has no need to, and he is exposing himself to danger, because if a person dies in debt he will not be forgiven, even if he dies as a shaheed on the battlefield, until his debt is paid off. Muslim narrated (1886) from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The shaheed will be forgiven for every sin except debt.” And al-Nasaa’i narrated (4605) that Muhammad ibn Jahsh (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We were sitting with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he raised his head towards the sky, then he put his palm on his forehead and said: “Subhaan-Allaah! What a strict issue has been revealed to me!” We remained silent and were afraid. The following morning I asked him, “O Messenger of Allaah, what is this strict issue that has been revealed?” He said, “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if a man were killed in battle for the sake of Allaah, then brought back to life, then killed and brought back to life again, then killed, and he owed a debt, he would not enter Paradise until his debt was paid off.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 4367. The point is that if you are well off and you do not need the money you have, and you think it most likely that you will not need it in the near future, then it is better for you to pay cash and not to purchase by installments. And Allaah knows best."
"What is the status of the hadeeth, “No man is scratched by a thorn…”?","Question What is the status of this hadeeth? It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is scratched by a thorn, or stumbles, or has a twitching in a vein, except for a sin, and what Allaah forgives is greater.” Does this mean that everything that happens to a person is because of his sin? I read this in Tafseer al-Qurtubi, and I looked in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Fath al-Baari, but I could not find it.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tabari in al-Tafseer, 5/175; and by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eemaan, 7/153; from the mursal hadeeth of Qataadah. A mursal report is one which is narrated by a Taabi’i from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), with no narrator in between. This is one of the categories of da’eef (weak) hadeeth. So this hadeeth has a weak isnaad, as was mentioned by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1796. Secondly: The meaning of the hadeeth is sound and is supported by other evidence from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The calamities that befall a man may be as the result of sin that he has committed, so this calamity may be expiation for that sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a Messenger to mankind, and Allaah is Sufficient as a Witness” [al-Nisa’ 4:79] “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much” [al-Shoora 42:30] Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (1/529): “Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah” means, it is by the grace, bounty, kindness and mercy of Allaah. “but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself” means, it is because of your own actions. This is like the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much” [al-Shoora 42:30] Al-Saddi, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd said: “is from yourself” means, because of your sin. Qataadah said concerning this verse, “is from yourself” means, as a punishment to you, O son of Adam, for your sin. Thirdly: The calamities that befall a believer in this world raise him in status and expiate for his sins. Hence the believer should accept whatever calamities Allaah decrees for him, and should realize that this is good for him. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no calamity that befalls a Muslim but Allaah expiates (sin) thereby, even a thorn that pricks him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5640; Muslim, 2572. Muslim (2572) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is nothing that befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah will record a hasanah (good deed) for him thereby, or erase from him a sin.” And Allaah knows best."
Will he be rewarded for sitting in the mosque after praying without reciting dhikr or waiting for the next prayer?,"Question Often, after I have finished praying in congregation and after I have finished reciting dhikr and offering the Sunnah prayers after the [obligatory] prayer, I sit in the mosque because I find it peaceful and calming. Is there any reward for me in sitting like this (without reciting any dhikr or doing any act of worship), or is my sitting there like sitting any other public place?","Praise be to Allah.When the worshipper has finished praying and he sits in the place where he prayed, the angels pray for forgiveness for him, as is mentioned in the hadith which was narrated by al-Bukhaari (445) and Muslim (649) from Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels pray for one of you so long as he remains in the place where he prayed, so long as he does not commit a sin. They say: ‘O Allah, forgive him; O Allah, have mercy on him.’” According to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim: “So long as he does not commit a sin there, so long as he does not cause annoyance to others there. What appears to be the case is that this virtue is attained by the one who sits and does not commit any sin there or cause annoyance to others by backbiting and the like, whether he occupies himself by reciting dhikr or not. For the grace and generosity of Allah are immense. So there is the hope that you will attain this reward, in sha Allah, but if you use the time to remember Allah ( dhikr) or recite Qur’an, this will be better. And Allah knows best."
Broken ties of kinship and relationships,Question What is the meaning of silat al-rahm (upholding the ties of kinship)?,"Praise be to Allah.Islam calls for the upholding of the ties of kinship because of the great effect that this has on achieving social cohesion and perpetuating cooperation and love among the Muslims. Upholding the ties of kinship is a duty because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of ) the wombs (kinship)…” [al-Nisa’ 4:1] “And give to the kindred his due and to the miskeen (poor)…” [al-Isra’ 17:26] Allah has warned us against cutting the ties of kinship (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who break the Covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e., they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e., they will be far away from Allah’s Mercy); And for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e., Hell).” [al-Ra’d 13:25] What punishment could be worse than the curse and the evil home that awaits those who sever the ties of kinship ? They deny themselves the reward for upholding the ties of kinship in the Hereafter, in addition to denying themselves much good in this world, which is a long life and ample provision. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be increased and his life to be extended, should uphold the ties of kinship.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5986 and Muslim, 2557). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah created the universe, and when He had finished, kinship (al-rahm) stood up and said, “This is the standing up of one who seeks Your protection from being cut off.” Allah said, “Yes, would it please you if I were to take care of those who take care of you and cut off those who cut you off?” It said, “Of course.” Allah said, “Then your prayer in granted.”’” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Recite, if you wish (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.’ [Muhammad 47:22-23].” (Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 16/112). Once we understand this, we need to ask: who is the one who upholds the ties of kinship? This was explained by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “The one who maintains a relationship with his relatives only because they maintain a relationship with him is not truly upholding the ties of kinship. The one who truly upholds those ties is the one who does so even if they break off the relationship.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5645). If the relationship is merely one of returning favours and giving like in return for like, and not taking the initiative, then this is not upholding the ties of kinship, it is only responding in kind. Some people follow the principle of giving a gift in return for a gift, and visiting in return for a visit, so if someone does not give them a gift, they do not give him a gift, and if he does not visit them, they do not visit him. This is not what is meant by upholding the ties of kinship at all, and this is not what is required by Islam. This is merely responding in kind, it is not the higher degree which Islam urges us to reach. A man said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot dust in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.” (Reported by Muslim with commentary by al-Nawawi, 16/115). Who could bear to put up with hot dust? We seek refuge with Allah from cutting off the ties of kinship."
Should he donate money to a Buddhist temple in order to keep his job and protect himself from any harm?,Question I am working in a manufacturing company of a multi-national in Sri Lanka. There are about 300 workers here but only 2 muslims. I have the opportunity to pray five times and also to go to Jummah etc. The top management occationally organise many budhist cermons and some times plan to organise donations (small contribution from employees) to temple. This is a sinhala majority county. Pl advise what we should do or the intention we should have when making such payment occationally to keep peace and harmony at work place.,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to donate to a temple or church or any place in which anyone or anything other than Allah is worshipped, because that is helping in evil and in the greatest of evils. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment” [al-Maa’idah 5:2] In these temples shirk and idolatry are practised, so how can a Muslim think of donating to them? Can that be anything other than helping and contributing to the support of shirk and those who believe in it? What you have to do is refuse to give these donations, even if it means that you have to leave your job in this factory, because the believer cannot sell his religion for worldly gain. Work is not one of the things that make this great evil permissible, and the one who gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it. For more information please see the answer to question no. 50173 And Allah knows best."
The reason why Ramadan changes every year in relation to the Gregorian calendar,Question I hope that you can explain with regard to the Hijri calendar: why does Ramadan come thirteen or fourteen days later than the Gregorian date?,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is well-known that different nations and peoples use different calendars. There is the solar calendar, the beginning and end of which are based on the movements of the sun; it has 365 days. And there is the lunar calendar, which is based on the appearance and disappearance of the moon at the beginning and end of the month; it has 354 days. The solar calendar is similar to the lunar calendar with regard to the number of months, but it differs from it with regard to the number of days. So it is eleven days longer than the lunar calendar. The Gregorian calendar is based on the solar year, whereas the Hijri calendar is based on the lunar year. It is for this reason that the beginning of Ramadan every year differs in relation to the Gregorian calendar, and as a result of that it moves through the four seasons. Secondly: The lunar calendar is the calendar that must be followed, because Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the reckoning” [Yoonus 10:5]. Ibn Katheer said: From the sun the days are known, and from the phases of the moon the months and years are known. End quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (4/248). The sun defines day and night only; as for the moon, Allah – may He be glorified and exalted – has made it a measure for the months and years, as He says: (interpretation of the meaning): “... and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the reckoning” [Yoonus 10:5]. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are Sacred, (i.e. the 1st, the 7th, the 11th and the 12th months of the Islamic calendar). That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein” [at-Tawbah 9:36]. The words “That is the right religion” indicate that this calendar is the correct way that Allah has approved for us, and that anything other than it, that is customarily used by other nations, is not correct, because it is subject to mistakes and confusion. Al-Qurtubi said: This verse indicates that what is required is to connect the rulings on acts of worship and other matters to the months and years as known to the Arabs, and not the months that the Persians, Romans and Copts follow. End quote from al-Jaami‘ li Ahkaam al-Qur’an (8/133) Ash-Shawkaani said: This verse states that no attention should be paid to the months used by the Persians, Romans and Copts, some of which they make thirty days long, and others they make more or less than that. End quote from Fath al-Qadeer (2/521). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you (O Muhammad SAW) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage” [al-Baqarah 2:189]; i.e., they are signs for the people with regard to entering and exiting ihram [for Hajj]; for beginning and ending the fast; for marriage, divorce and ‘iddah; for dealing, trade and debts; for both their religious and worldly affairs. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Here Allah tells us that they are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind. This is general in meaning and applies to all their affairs. Thus Allah has made the new moon signs to mark fixed periods of time with regard to the established rulings of Islam… That includes the fast, Hajj, ‘iddah, and expiatory fasts. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (25/133). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the Western calendar, there is no tangible, rational or religious basis for it. Hence you will find some of the months having twenty-eight days, some having thirty days, and some having thirty-one days, with no known reason for this difference. Moreover, these months have no tangible sign that people may refer to in order to work out times, unlike the lunar calendar which does have a physical sign that is known to everyone. End quote from Tafseer al-Baqarah (2/371) And Allah knows best."
"Concerning obedience to his disbelieving parents, and attribution of an illegitimate son","Question I am a revert and from my jahiliyya time I have a son who is now 9 years. His mother and me were never married and 3 years ago we separated. 2 years ago I reverted alhamdulillah and now I am married to a pious and religious muslim woman alhamdulillah. My son is today living more with his mother than with me and my wife plan to move to another city where there is a mosque and more muslims to socialize with, and its not even far away but somehow my mother and her husband (I refer to them as my parents) are against this idea and cannot understand it. They are also non-muslims and sometimes I feel that they are a little against my wife, and also they have difficulties in understanding that we are practicing muslims. I know that as muslim I have to obey my parents even when they are kuffar but until what point? I just want to plan and live my life with my wife and I have no intention to cut my family ties with either my son or with them. What can you advise me to handle this situation? Now my parents are angry with me and we are not talking at the moment. And what is the ruling in Islam according to my son? Who is he attributed to?","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: We congratulate you on your entering Islam, the religion of truth and of sound human nature with which Allah created His slaves. We ask Allah, may He be glorified, to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion and to protect you from the evil of the devils among mankind and the jinn. With regard to your disbelieving parents, you have to honour them, uphold ties with them, and keep company with them on a basis of kindness. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years give thanks to Me and to your parents, unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.” [Luqmaan 31:14,15] It says in al-Fawaakih ad-Dawaani ‘ala Risaalat Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawaani (2/290): One of the individual obligations upon every accountable individual is honouring his parents, i.e., treating them kindly, even if they are evildoers, with regard to anything that does not involve shirk (or sin), and even if they are mushrikeen, because of the verses which indicate that in general terms. Rights are not waived because of evildoing or being of different religions. End quote. With regard to obeying disbelieving parents in matters that are right and proper, the scholars differed as to whether that is obligatory. A number of scholars stated that it is also obligatory to obey them in matters that do not involve disobedience towards Allah, may He be exalted. It says in al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah wa’l-Minah al-Mar‘iyyah (1/437): From the above it appears that obedience to one’s father is obligatory even if he is a disbeliever. This was stated definitively by the author of an-Nuzum. The apparent meaning of his words in al-Mustaw‘ab as-Saabiq concerning the words “even if they are evildoers” indicates that if the parents are disbelievers, in that case it is not obligatory to obey them. That concurs with what was mentioned by our companions, that their permission is not needed for jihad, regardless of whether it is an individual obligation in his case or not. End quote. But if the disbelieving parents behave in such a manner that it seems that want to bar their child from Islam or from following its laws and obligatory duties, or from something that is more beneficial to him in terms of his religious commitment that enables him to learn and understand matters of religion, then it is definitely not permissible to obey them in that case. Based on that, you do not have to obey your parents by not moving to that place that is better for you and your wife in terms of your religious commitment. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a father who did not let his son attend classes and study circles, which resulted in the son losing his religious commitment and going to watch movies and do other haraam things; is the action of this father regarded as barring his son from the path of Allah, and is the son obliged to obey his father in this instance? He replied: If your father or mother forbids you to attend study circles, you should not obey him, because attending study circles is something good, and it will not result in any harm to the parents. Therefore we say: do not obey them, but strive to be diplomatic with them. What is meant by being diplomatic is not to tell them that you are going to study circles; rather you can act as if you are going to see your friends and the like. With regard to the father and mother who prevent the son from attending study circles, that comes under the heading of preventing the remembrance of Allah, so they are sinning by doing this. What the father and mother should do if they see their son is interested in seeking knowledge is to rejoice at that and help him as much as possible, because this is a blessing from Allah to him and to them. Who is the child who can benefit a parent if he or she dies? It is the righteous child, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When a person dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge or a righteous child who will pray for him.” End quote. Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh, no. 99, p. 9 Our advice to you in this case is that you should move to that place where there is a mosque and more Muslims, so that you can cooperate with them in righteousness and piety and in obedience to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. We should not neglect to remind you to strive to call your parents to the truth, for they are in the greatest need of that, to save them from disbelief and sin. You should use wise means of calling them and strive to show kindness towards them as much as you can. Secondly: With regard to this child who was born from an illicit relationship, he should not be attributed to you at all; rather he should be attributed to his mother who gave birth to him. That is because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The child is for the (owner of the) bed and the fornicator gets nothing.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2053) and Muslim (1457) But if the woman with whom the man committed that evil act is not married, then a number of scholars said that it is permissible for the fornicator in that case to attribute the child she bore to himself. This has been discussed in fatwa no. 85042. And Allah knows best."
Ruling on breaking one’s fast in Ramadaan because of exams,"Question If the exams for high school graduation are held in Ramadaan, is it permissible for a student to break his fast in Ramadaan so that he will be able to concentrate in the exam?","Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for one who is accountable to break his fast in Ramadaan because of exams, because that is not one of the excuses that are allowed in sharee’ah. Rather he has to fast, and do his studying and revision at night if it is too hard for him to do that during the day. Those who are in charge of exams should be kind to the students and not make the exams in Ramadaan, thus serving two interests, the interests of the fast and to help the students prepare for the exams. It was narrated in a saheeh report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O Allaah, whoever is put in charge of any of the affairs of my ummah and is kind to them, show kindness towards him, and whoever is put in charge of any of the affairs of my ummah and is harsh towards them, show harshness towards him.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). So my advice to those who are in charge of exams is to be kind to the students and not to have exams in Ramadaan, but to have them before or after. We ask Allaah to give us all strength."
Ruling on using a shoe as a sutrah,Question What is the ruling on using a shoe as a sutrah?.,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with that, unless there is any najaasah (impurity) or dirt on it, in which case it should not be used as a sutrah because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade spitting in front of oneself. But if there is no visible dirt or najaasah on it, then there is nothing wrong with using it as a sutrah. End quote. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)."
Can You Pray Without Wudu and Tayammum?,Question I am a Muslim who is in a wheelchair. My question is about wudu/ablution I am unable to grip with my hands. I have a health care provider in the morning after fajr who gives me a full bath daily. Is this sufficient for the whole day? I tried clean dust or sand but could not wipe my face completely and had a hard time putting hands in sand/dust. Please give advice.,"Praise be to Allah.Can you pray without wudu and tayammum? Islam came to make things easy for people and not to burden them with things they cannot do. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286] Allah has enjoined wudu upon the Muslims, but because He knows that some of them are weak and unable to do it, He has granted them a concession and has prescribed tayammum as an alternative to water, and made it a means of purification for the Muslim. But if it is too difficult to do tayammum , then it is permissible to pray without wudu and without tayammum . This is like the case of one who cannot find a garment to cover his ‘awrah in prayer; it is permissible for him to pray without a garment. If someone can help you to do ghusl or wudu , then all well and good, and that will suffice you for the rest of the day so long as you do not break that wudu in any way. If you do tayammum for yourself or if someone else does it for you, it is sufficient to pass your hand over the dust, and wipe whatever you can of your face. You may also – because of hardship and sickness – put two prayers together if it is difficult for you to do wudu at the time of the second prayer. If it is not easy for you to do wudu or tayammum until the time for the prayer is nearly over, then you have to pray even if you did not purify yourself with either water or dust. Evidence for the permissibility to pray without wudu or tayammum The evidence that it is permissible for a man to pray even if he cannot purify himself is as follows: It was narrated that `Aishah borrowed a necklace from ‘Asma and lost it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent a man to find it, then the time for prayer came but they did not have any water, so they prayed then complained about that to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then Allah revealed the verse of tayammum. Usayd ibn Hudayr said to A’ishah, “May Allah reward you with good, for by Allah there has never happened to you anything that you dislike but Allah brought something good for you and for the Muslims through it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 329; Muslim, 367) In a report narrated by al-Tabarani and Abu ‘Awwanah, it states clearly that they prayed without wudu. `Aishah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent Usayd ibn Hudayr and some others to look for a necklace that ‘Aishah had lost. The time for prayer came and they prayed without wudu. When they came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) they complained to him about that, then the verse of tayammum was revealed.” Al-Nufayli added: And Usayd ibn Hudayr said: “May Allah reward you with good, for by Allah there has never happened to you anything that you dislike but Allah granted relief for you and for the Muslims through it.” (Narrated by Abu Awwanah, 873; al-Tabarani, 131) This indicates that in the absence of water – which was the only means of purification before tayammum – it is permissible to pray without wudu, so it is more apt that it is permissible to pray in the absence of dust which is of a lower status than water. From this it may be understood that the person who is unable to purify himself – whether that is because there is no means of purification or because he is unable to find it or is unable to use it if it is present – is permitted to pray without purifying himself. Al-Bukhari included this hadith in a chapter entitled, Bab idha lam yajid ma-an wa la turaban (Chapter: if there is no water or dust). Ibn Rashid said: “It is as if the author is stating that tayammum is not prescribed if there is no dust, and that was after tayammum had been prescribed. It is as if he is saying that their ruling concerning the lack of the means of purification – which was water only – was the same as our ruling on cases when neither of the two means of purification, water and dust, is available. Hence we know that this hadith is suited to the heading, even though the hadith does not say that they had no dust, rather it says that they had no water. This indicates that prayer is obligatory for the one who has neither of the two means of purification, because the hadith shows that they prayed believing that it was obligatory to do so. If praying in such circumstances were not allowed, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told them off for doing so. This is the view of al-Shafi’i, Ahmad, the majority of muhaddithin and most of the companions of Malik.” (Fath al-Bari, 1/440) Ibn al-Qayyim said: “If no dust is available, this is as if tayammum is not prescribed, and there is no difference. They prayed without doing tayammum because tayammum had not been prescribed at that time. The same applies to one who prays without tayammum because he does not have the material with which to do tayammum. What is the difference between not having it and it not being prescribed? According to analogy (qiyas) and the Sunnah, the one who does not have it should pray according to his circumstances, for Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. And he should not repeat the prayer, because he did what he was commanded to do so he does not have to repeat it. This is similar to the case of one who does not stand or face the qiblah or cover himself or recite because he is unable to do so. This is what is implied by the texts and by analogy.” (Hashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ‘ala Tahdhib Sunan Abi Dawud, 1/61) Ibn Qudamah said: “Because it is one of the conditions of prayer which is waived when one is unable to do it, as is the case with all the other conditions and pillars (essential parts) of the prayer. And he did what he was obliged to do as best he could, so he does not have to repeat it. This is like the one who is unable to cover himself and prays naked; or one who is unable to face the qiblah so he prays facing a different direction; or one who is unable to stand so he prays sitting.” (Al-Mughni, 1/157) Al-Shawkani said: “With regard to the phrase “so they prayed without wudu”, a number of scholars, including the compiler, understood this to mean that it is obligatory to pray even if neither of the two means of purification, water and dust, is available. It does not say in the hadith that they had no dust, rather it says only that they had no water, but the lack of water at that time was like the lack of water and dust, because there was no means of purification other than water. The point is that they prayed believing it to be obligatory to do so. If prayer in such circumstances were not allowed, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told them off for doing so. This is the view of al-Shafi`i, Ahmad, the majority of muhadditheen and most of the companions of Malik.” (Nayl al-Awtar, 1/337) This is what the scholars said about this issue, and it is the most correct view. The ruling in your case is like that of one who cannot find water or dust, if you cannot find someone to do tayammum for you and you are unable to do it yourself. And Allah knows best."
Wearing short clothes in front of one’s sons,Question I have four sons and I wear short clothes in front of them. What is the ruling on that?,"Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible for a woman to wear short clothes in front of her sons or mahrams, or to uncover anything in front of them except that which is customarily uncovered and will not cause any fitnah (temptation). Rather she should only wear short clothes in front of her husband."
Passing wind from the front passage,"Question If a woman passes wind from her front passage (vagina), does this break her wudoo’?",Praise be to Allah.Passing wind from the front passage does not break wudoo’. And Allaah knows best.
He died and did not perform Hajj because he was negligent – can someone perform Hajj on his behalf?,"Question There is a person who died in his 40s. He was able to do Hajj, and he prayed all five prayers regularly. He used to say each year, “I will go for Hajj this year,” but then he died. He has heirs – can they perform Hajj on his behalf? Is there any sin on him?.","Praise be to Allah. The scholars differed concerning such cases. Some of them said that others may perform Hajj on his behalf and that will benefit him, and it will be as if he did Hajj for himself. Others said that no one can perform Hajj on his behalf, and even if people performed Hajj on his behalf a thousand times, it would not be accepted and would not discharge his duty. This view is correct, because this man failed to do an act of worship that was obligatory for him and should have been done straight away, with no excuse. So how can we make it up for him after his death after he neglected it? Now the estate has to do with the rights of the heirs – how can we deprive them of the costs of this Hajj, when it is not going to be accepted? This is what Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned in Tahdheeb al-Sunan and this is also my view. If a person fails to do Hajj out of negligence when he is able to do it, no Hajj will ever count for him, even if the people do Hajj on his behalf a thousand times. As for zakaah, there are some scholars who say that if a person dies and zakaah is paid on his behalf, that is sufficient, but the basic principle that I have mentioned implies that it does not discharge his duty of paying zakaah. But I think that the zakaah may be paid from the estate, because it has to do with the rights of the poor and those who are entitled to zakaah, unlike Hajj, the cost of which cannot be taken from the estate, because it does not have to do with anybody’s rights, whereas zakaah has to do with people’s rights. So zakaah should be given to those who are entitled to it, but that does not discharge the person’s duty, and he will be given the punishment of those who do not pay zakaah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. The same applies to fasting. If it is known that this person did not fast and was negligent in making it up, then it cannot be made up on his behalf, because he was negligent and failed to do this act of worship, which is one of the pillars of Islam, with no excuse. If it is made up on his behalf it will not benefit him. The hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever dies owing fasts, his heir should fast on his behalf,” applies to one who has not been negligent, and with regard to the one who failed to make up missed fasts out of negligence with no legitimate shar’i excuse, what is the point of making it up on his behalf?

She did not fast because she was worried about her nursing baby,Question A woman gave birth in Ramadaan and did not make up her missed fasts after Ramadaan because she was worried about her nursing baby. Then she got pregnant and gave birth in the following Ramadaan. Is it permissible for her to give charity instead of fasting?,"Praise be to Allah.What this woman has to do is to fast and make up the days she has missed, even if it is after the second Ramadaan, because she had an excuse not to make up the days she had missed between the first Ramadaan and the second. I wonder whether it will be too difficult for her to fast day after day in the winter even though she is still breastfeeding, but probably Allaah will give her the strength to make up the second Ramadaan. If she is not able to do that then it is OK for her to delay making it up until the second Ramadaan."
Burying a kaafir in the Muslim graveyard,"Question Is it permissible to bury a kaafir child in the Muslim graveyard if a Muslim has taken him to adopt him, then he dies before reaching the age of adolescence?","Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to bury a kaafir in the Muslim graveyard, regardless of whether he was adopted by a Muslim or not, or whether he had reached the age of adolescence or not. But if there was any indication that he was Muslim (or that he had become Muslim), then he may be buried in the Muslim graveyard. It should also be noted that adoption [in the sense that the child is given the name of the person who adopts him] is forbidden in Islam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers.” [al-Ahzaab 33:5] And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace."
Does a person who died of cancer as a result of smoking attain the status of a martyr?,Question Does a person who died of cancer as a result of smoking attain the status of a martyr?.,"Praise be to Allah. It is proven in the saheeh Sunnah that there are various kinds of martyrs who will attain the status of martyrdom in the Hereafter; this is by the grace and mercy of Allah. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The martyrs are five: the one who dies of the plague, the one who dies of a stomach disease, the one who drowns, the one who is crushed beneath a falling wall, and the martyr who is killed for the sake of Allaah.” Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ibn al-Teen said: All of these are deaths which involve hardship. Allah has bestowed His grace upon the ummah of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) by making them means of erasing their sins and increasing their rewards, and enabling them to attain the status of martyrdom. Fath al-Baari, 6/44 If a person dies of cancer, some of the scholars are of the view that he is included among the types of martyr mentioned in the hadeeth, on the basis that the word mabtoon (the one who dies of a disease in the abdomen) is general and includes everyone who dies of a disease in his abdomen and that this does not apply to any one specific disease. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The word mabtoon means the one with a disease in the abdomen, which is diarrhoea. Al-Qaadi said: And it was said that he is the one who suffers from dropsy or oedema and swelling of the abdomen. And it was said that it refers to the one who suffers some disease in his abdomen. And it was said that it refers to anyone who dies from a disease in the abdomen in general. End quote from Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi. But it should be noted that this suggestion is connected to two conditions: (i) that the site of the cancer be in the abdomen so that he may truly be said to be mabtoon. Shaykh ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Does a person who dies of cancer come under the heading of mabtoon? He replied: No, because cancer is not always in the stomach; it may be somewhere other than the stomach. Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood (tape no. 230) As the site of your friend’s cancer was in the throat, he is not included among any of the groups who are regarded as martyrs. (ii) that the disease should not have been caused by smoking, taking drugs or drinking alcohol, or other haraam things, unless he has repented sincerely from that and has given up consuming those haraam things. This condition is general and applies to all those mentioned in the hadeeth. If a woman is pregnant as the result of zina and dies in labour, she is not regarded as one of the martyrs. If a person who drowned had boarded the boat or ship in order to commit sin or some immoral activity, and dies as a result of drowning, he is not one of the martyrs. A person who is killed by a falling wall when he is committing zina or drinking alcohol is not one of the martyrs. In the answer to question no. 45669, we have quoted the Standing Committee as saying that a person who dies as the result of a car accident when he was inside the car comes under the same heading as one who was killed by a falling wall, so he is a martyr, by Allah’s leave. But this cannot be applied to those foolish young men to whom this happens when they are racing in their cars, or to those who compete in difficult circumstances in the mountains or in the snow (“extreme sports”). In the answer to question no. 22140, we quoted Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah as saying that if a person drowns after boarding a ship for sinful purposes, he is not a martyr. And elsewhere he said: Whoever wants to follow a path where the possibilities of being safe or being killed are equal has to refrain from following it; if he does not refrain, then he is aiding in his own destruction so he is not a martyr. Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 5/381 Al-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Al-Qurtubi said: This and the previous one -- i.e., those who are killed by a falling wall or drowning -- if they did not take risks and did not fail to take precautions, (then they are martyrs). But if they did not take precautions and died as a result of that, then they are sinners. Al-Deebaaj ‘ala Muslim (4/508) In al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (26/273, 274) it says: An exception is made in the case of one who travels for the purpose of sin and dies away from home. Another exception is made in the case of one who drowns but was sinning by boarding the ship when he knew that it was most likely not to be safe for him to do so, or he boarded it for the purpose of committing sin. Another exception is made in the case of a woman who is pregnant as a result of zina and dies in childbirth. End quote. If the person who is slain in battle was fighting for the sake of tribalism or to show off, he does not attain the virtue or status of martyrdom, and it is more likely that such people will not attain that great reward. Summary: Cancer in and of itself does not mean that the person who dies of it is one of the types of martyrs, unless the disease was in his abdomen. That is not what is stated in the hadeeth; rather it is the ijtihaad (opinion) of some scholars with regard to the meaning of mabtoon. If a person’s disease was caused by smoking and the like, and he dies of it before repenting, then he is not a martyr, even if the disease was in his abdomen. But if the disease in his abdomen was not the result of a haraam action, we hope that he will attain the status of the martyrs in the Hereafter, in sha Allah. And Allaah knows best."
Is the son of her husband’s daughter regarded as a mahram for her?,Question Is it permissible for a woman who is over sixty to not wear hijab in front of the son of her husband’s daughter who is fifteen years old? He is like a grandson to her. Is it permissible for her to shake hands with him or kiss him? Her husband who is the grandfather of this boy has passed away.,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: The son who is asked about here is regarded as a mahram for this woman, so she may shake hands with him and uncover in front of him as she uncovers in front of her mahrams, and it makes no deference that his grandfather is deceased. The way in which he is her mahram is that she is the wife of his grandfather on his mother’s side. Permanently forbidden in marriage for a man are his father’s and his grandfather’s wife, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches, whether the grandfather is on his father’s side or his mother’s, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way” [al-Nisa’ 4:22] It says in Zaad al-Mustaqni’: The marriage contract makes the wife of the father and every grandfather a mahram. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Sharh: The marriage contract is valid, and makes forbidden in marriage the wife of his father or grandfather, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches. Every woman who has been married by his father, even if he divorced her, is permanently forbidden in marriage to him, and the same applies to every woman who was married by his grandfather, whether on his father’s side or his mother’s. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way” [al-Nisa’ 4:22] If he marries her, that is worse than zina, because Allaah says concerning zina (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)” [al-Isra’ 17:32] But concerning this, Allaah says: “indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way”. Marrying mahrams – Allaah forbid – is worse than zina. Hence many of the scholars were of the view that the one who commits zina with one of his mahrams, even if he is not married, is to be killed. There is a hadeeth concerning that in al-Sunan. So the wife of one's father or grandfather, not matter how far the line of ascent reaches, is forbidden in marriage, whether on the father’s side or the mother’s, and Allaah has not stipulated that the marriage should be consummated etc, rather this ruling comes into effect by virtue of a valid marriage contract. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/198 This is a matter concerning which there is no difference of opinion among the scholars. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, discussing the fact that a father’s wife is a mahram: It is the same whether she is the wife of his father, or the wife of his paternal grandfather, or the wife of his maternal grandfather, whether near or far. There is no dispute concerning that among the scholars as far as we know, praise be to Allaah. End quote from al-Mughni, 9/518, 524 Secondly: With regard to kissing, she may kiss him so long as there is no risk of fitnah, and it is better to kiss him on the forehead or head. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a kissing a mahram man. He said: If he has come from a journey and there is no fear (of fitnah). But it should never be on the lips, only on the forehead or head. Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 2/266 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about kissing mahrams. He said: If kissing mahrams is done with desire or one fears that desire may be provoked, it is haraam without a doubt. If there is no fear of fitnah then there is nothing wrong with kissing on the head or forehead. As for kissing on the cheek or lips, that should be avoided, except in the case of a father and daughter or mother and son, for example. It is more lenient in this case because Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) entered upon ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she was sick and kissed her on the cheek, and said, “How are you, O my daughter?” End quote, from Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam, p. 691. And Allaah knows best."
She entered ihraam for ‘Umrah from Makkah and forgot one or two laps of saa’i,"Question Last year I intended to perform an ‘Umra, 3 or 4 days after I arrived in Makkah. In Makkah some people told me that entering ihram is from Makkah while I am a visitor. Then I started performing an ‘Umra. I forgot one or two circuits of saa’i. I want to perform another ‘Umra next Tuesday. What shall I do about my previous ‘Umra?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: If you entered ihraam for ‘Umrah from inside Makkah, and did not go out to a place beyond the boundaries of the Haram, such as al-Tan’eem or what is called Masjid ‘Aa’ishah (the Mosque of Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her)), then you failed to do one of the obligatory parts of ‘Umrah, namely entering ihraam from the meeqaat. The meeqaat for ‘Umrah for the people of Makkah and those who are staying there is the area outside the boundaries of the Haram, so the one who is in Makkah and wants to do ‘Umrah must go out to any area that is beyond the boundaries of the Haram and enter ihraam from there. If he does not do that he must offer a sacrifice of a sheep to be slaughtered and its meat to be distributed among the poor of the Haram. See the answer to question no. 48955. Secondly: With regard to what you have mentioned about omitting laps of saa’i, if it is only doubt or conjecture that happened after you had finished saa’i, then it does not matter, because doubt after finishing an act of worship does not affect it. Ibn Qaasim al-‘Aabidi said in his commentary on Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (4/81): If you are uncertain about the number before you finish (the act of worship), then you must proceed on the basis of the lower number, according to scholarly consensus. If you think something different or are not sure of it afterwards, i.e., after finishing it, it does not matter. End quote. If you are certain that you did a saa’i of six or five laps, then your saa’i was incomplete and your exiting ihraam from ‘Umrah is not valid. One of the essential parts of ‘Umrah remains to be done, namely saa’i, and you are still in ihraam, and you must do three things: 1.Avoid all the things that are forbidden whilst in ihraam, because you are still in your ihraam. 2.Go back to Makkah and do saa’i from scratch. 3.Exit ihraam but cut a fingertip’s length from your hair, because your first exiting ihraam took place before the rituals had been completed, so it did not count. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who did ‘Umrah but his saa’i was one lap short. What must he do? He replied: This man is still in ihraam and he must stop wearing ordinary clothes and avoid the things that are forbidden whilst in ihraam, and he must immediately put on the ihraam garments in the place where he is, and go to Makkah and do saa’i again, because he is still in ‘Umrah now. End quote. Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (22/435). With regard to any infractions of ihraam that you may have committed during this period, if they were due to ignorance of the ruling, then you do not have to do anything, but if they were done despite your knowing the ruling that you were still in a state of ihraam, then you must offer a fidyah for them. See the answer to question no. 36522. Thirdly: It is not prescribed for you to enter ihraam for ‘Umrah from the meeqaat during your upcoming trip (on Thursday), because you are still in a state of ihraam for your first ‘Umrah, as stated above. But if you reach Makkah and complete your first ‘Umrah then exit ihraam, then you want to do a second ‘Umrah, you should go out to al-Tan’eem or anywhere that is beyond the boundaries of the Haram, and enter ihraam for ‘Umrah. We ask Allaah to accept (acts of worship) from us and from you. And Allaah knows best."
Women watching men on TV with no desire,Question is it haram to watch the T.V and there is televisor male in and I watch the news or any program with no other reason. is it Haram to watch male in t.v with no(shahwa),"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim has to protect his senses and faculties from everything that is of no benefit to him, let alone whatever is haraam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned (by Allaah).” [al-Israa’ 17:36] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Looking is one of the arrows of Shaytaan.” Television is full of men and women who are promiscuous and immoral, and usually is not free from music and all other kinds of haraam things, so in general it is not good to look at it. May Allaah help us. As regards women looking at what normally appears of men for a specific reason and without any kind of desire, this is permissible as a number of scholars have said. But looking at the TV does not come under this heading, because there is no need for it, so women should turn away from everything in which there is no benefit, and keep themselves busy with things that will bring good consequences. And Allaah is the source of strength."
Ghusl for deceased who is burned,"Question Should a deceased person who is burned be washed or not? And how should he be washed, kknowing that in some cases the person may be burned completely?.","Praise be to Allah.If a person dies from being burnt and it is possible to wash him, then he should be washed. But if there is the fear that the body may be damaged or caused to disintegrate by washing, then water should be poured over him; if there is the fear that this may cause the body to disintegrate, then tayammum should be done if possible. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The one who has been crushed by a falling wall, the one who has been burned and the one who has drowned should be washed if possible; if there is the fear that washing may cause the body to distingreate, then water should be poured over them without touching them. If there is the fear that water may cause the body to distintegarte, then they should not be washed, but tayammum should be done for them if possible, as in the case of a living person who may be harmed by water. If it is not possible to wash the deceased because there is no water available, then tayammum should be done, and if it is possible to wash some parts and not others, then those parts that can be washed should be washed, and tayammum should be done for the rest, as is the case of the living. End quote, from al-Mughni. 2/209. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: How should ghusl be done for a person who died in an accident and his body is disfigured and some parts may have been cut off? He replied: It is obligatory to wash him, just like anyone else, if that is possible. If it is not possible then tayammum should be done for him, because tayammum takes the place of washing with water when that is not possible. Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah, 13/123 In Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (8/371) it says concerning ghusl for a person who died in an accident and whose body is cut in pieces: If it is not possible to wash him, then tayammum must be done for him, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can” [al-Taghaabun 64:16] because Allaah has prescribed tayammum for purification from both major and minor impurity when there is no water available or when one is unable to use it, or when using it will cause harm. And Allaah knows best."
Ruling on a woman travelling without a mahram,Question What is the ruling on a woman travelling without a mahram because her work requires that of her?,"Praise be to Allah.It is haraam because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel without a mahram.” This was narrated by Ahmad from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) in his Musnad. Even if her work requires that of her, we say that if she cannot find a mahram then she should not travel."
Working in an alcohol factory,"Question An inquirer from Gambia is asking, what is the ruling on a Muslim who sells alcohol or drugs, can we call him a Muslim or not? What is the ruling on a Muslim who works in an alcohol factory, does he have to give up his job if he cannot find any other job?","Praise be to Allah.Selling alcohol and other intoxicants is a grave evil, and working in alcohol factories is haraam and is an evil, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al Birr and At Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”[al-Maa'idah 5:2] Undoubtedly selling alcohol, drugs and cigarettes constitutes cooperating in sin and transgression, and working in alcohol factories also constitutes cooperating in sin and transgression. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al Ansaab [stone altars for sacrifices to idols, etc.], and Al Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from As Salaah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maa’idah 5:90] It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who extracts the juice, the one for whom it is extracted, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who sells it, the one who buys it and the one who consumes its price. And it was also narrated in a saheeh report that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has made a covenant that whoever dies drinking alcohol, He will give him to drink of the mud of khibaal.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allaah, what is the mud of khibaal?” He said, “The juice of the people of Hell” or “the sweat of the people of Hell.” With regard to the ruling, the one who does this is a sinner and an evildoer by so doing; he is lacking in faith and on the Day of Resurrection he will be subject to the will of Allaah. If He wills, He will forgive him and if He wills, He will punish him, if he dies before he repents. This is according to the Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills” [al-Nisaa’ 4:48] This ruling applies if he does not regard that as being permissible. If he does regard it as being permissible then he is a kaafir by doing so, and if he dies he should not be washed or the funeral (janaazah) prayer offered for him, according to all the scholars, because by doing that he is disbelieving in Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The same ruling applies to one who regards as permissible zina (adultery), sodomy, riba (usury) and other things which are unanimously agreed to be haraam, such as disobeying one’s parents, severing ties of kinship or killing a soul unlawfully. But if a person does that or some of that knowing that it is haraam, and knowing that he is disobeying Allaah, then he is not a kaafir; rather he is an evildoer who will be subject to the will of Allaah in the Hereafter if he does not repent before he dies, as stated above concerning the ruling on one who drinks alcohol. And Allaah is the Source of strength."
Using tissue paper to remove najaasah (impurity),Question In Britain we use tissue paper to clean ourselves in the bathroom. Do we have to use water after using tissues or not?,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to use tissue paper and the like for istijmaar (cleaning the private parts after passing urine or stools by using stones, paper, etc.), and that is good enough as long as they clean the area properly. It is preferable if what is used for this purpose is an odd number, such as three sheets of tissue paper, or three stones, and so on, and one should not wipe less than three times. After that it is not essential to use water, but it is sunnah to do so."
Abortion of physically deformed foetus,Question Is it permissible to abort the foetus after medical tests have shown that it is physically deformed?,"Praise be to Allah.There are many causes of deformity of the foetus, many of which could be avoided; one could protect oneself from them or reduce their effects. Islam and medicine both urge people to avoid the causes of disease and to protect themselves against it as much as possible. The teachings of Islam urge us to protect our health and to protect the foetus from many diseases which are caused by ignoring the teachings of Islam and falling into sin such as zinaa (unlawful sexual relationships), drinking alcohol, smoking, and taking drugs. Modern medicine also warns mothers of the imminent danger of taking some medications, or being exposed to x-rays or gamma rays, especially in the early days of pregnancy. If it is proven in a definitive fashion, beyond any doubt, by a trustworthy medical committee, that the foetus is deformed, and that this deformity cannot be treated by the specialists, then in my view it is permissible to abort it, in view of the difficulties it would face in life and the hardship this would present to the parents, and the burdens and responsibilities of care it would place on the society. These considerations and others prompted the Islamic Fiqh Committee of the Muslim World League in its 12th conference held in Makkah on 15 Rajab 1410 AH (10/2/1990 CE), to issue the statement that “it is permissible to abort a foetus which is deformed in the manner mentioned above, with the consent of the parents and within the first 120 days from the beginning of the pregnancy.” The decision of the committee was in accordance with the fatwa of the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, no. 2484, issued on 16/7/1399 AH. But if the soul has been breathed into the foetus and it has completed 120 days, then it is not permissible to abort it, no matter what the deformity, unless continuation of the pregnancy would put the mother’s life in danger. This is because after the soul has been breathed into the foetus, it is considered to be a person who must be protected, regardless of whether it is free of disease or not, and regardless of whether there is hope of recovery or not. That is because Allaah has a reason for everything that He creates, which many people do not know, and He knows best what is right for His creation, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves), All Aware (of everything). [al-Mulk 67:14] In the birth of these deformed children there is a lesson for those who are of sound health, and it teaches us of the power of Allaah Who shows His creation the manifestations of His might and the wonders that He has created. Killing and aborting them is a purely materialistic view which pays no attention to matters of religion and morals. Perhaps the existence of these deformities will make people more humble and submissive towards their Lord, and make them bear them with patience, seeking a great reward from Him. Physical deformity is something that Allaah has decreed for some of His slaves. Whoever bears that with patience will attain victory. This is something that happens and has always happened throughout history, but unfortunately studies indicate that the rate of physical deformity is increasing, as the result of pollution of the environment and the increase of harmful rays in the atmosphere, which was previously unknown. It is by the mercy of Allaah that many deformed foetuses are miscarried or die before they are born. The Muslim woman and the Muslim family must bear with patience whatever happens to them, and seek the reward for that with Allaah. And Allaah knows best."
"The hadeeth “O ‘Ali, do not sleep until you do five things” is not saheeh","Question The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)) said: “Oh Ali!, do not sleep before you do five things: 1- reading the entire Holy Quran, 2-giving 4000 dirham in charity, 3- visiting the holy Ka’aba, 4- preserving your place in paradise 5- reconciling the enemies. Then Ali, May Allah be pleased with him, said: “Oh Allah’s Apostle! How shall I do this?” the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Do not you know that 1- if you read Surat “Qul Huwa-allahu Ahad” three times, you will be rewarded as if you read the entire Quran. 2- If you read Surat (Al-Fatiha) four times, you will be rewarded as if you gave 4000 dirham in charity. 3- if you say: “There is None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, alone without associate, to Him belongs sovereignty and praise, He gives life and causes death and He is over all things wholly capable” ten times, you will be rewarded as if you visited the holy Ka’aba. 4- if you say: “there is no power nor might except with Allah, The Most High, The Supreme” ten times, you will be considered as if preserved your place in paradise. 5- if you say: “I seek the forgiveness of Allah who none has the right to be worshipped but Him, the Ever-lasting, the Self-subsisting and supporter of all, and I repent to Him” ten times, you will be rewarded as if you reconciled the enemies”. I have heard that this Hadeeth is incorrect, and I believe it is correct; I seek your guidance regarding this Hadeeth. May Allah reward you!.","Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah. It says in Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz (26/328-330): A pamphlet which includes false ahaadeeth: the Lord of the Worlds, and blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and companions. This was answered by the Shaykh on 25/1/1414 AH: I have studied a pamphlet which says: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘O ‘Ali, do not sleep until you have done five things: reciting the entire Qur’aan, giving four thousand dirhams in charity, visiting the Ka’bah, safeguarding your place in Paradise and reconciling with your opponent.’ ‘Ali said: How can I do that, O Messenger of Allaah? The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Do you not know that if you recite Soorat al-Ikhlaas –Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad – three times you have recited the entire Qur’aan? And if you recite al-Faatihah four times you have given four thousand dirhams in charity; and if you say There is no god except Allaah alone with no partner or associate; to Him be dominion and praise, He gives life and causes death, and He is Able to do all things, ten times, you have visited the Ka’bah; and if you say There is no strength and no power except with Allaah, the Most High, the Almighty, ten times, you have safeguarded your place in Paradise; and if you say I seek forgiveness from Allaah, besides Whom there is no other god, the Ever-Living, the Eternal), ten times you have reconciled with your opponent.’ What this pamphlet contains was not narrated in any of the reliable books of hadeeth, rather it is a mawdoo’ (fabricated) hadeeth which was falsely attributed to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Hence I warn my Muslim brothers against being deceived by this hadeeth and other fabricated reports, or printing and distributing them among the Muslims, because that is misguiding the common folk and confusing them, and telling lies about the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who issued a stern warning to the one who does that deliberately, as he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in the saheeh hadeeth: “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Saheeh al-Bukhaari (1229); Introduction to Saheeh Muslim (4). And he said: “Whoever narrates a hadeeth from me thinking that it is false is a liar.” Introduction to Saheeh Muslim (1). In the saheeh reports narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and compiled in the reliable books of Saheeh, Sunan and Musnads there is sufficient information and the one whom Allaah guides to goodness has no need to turn to the reports of liars and fabricators. I ask Allaah to bless us all with beneficial knowledge and to enable us to do good deeds and to avoid all the paths of misguidance and deviance, for He is All-Hearing and Ever Near. And peace be upon you and the mercy of Allaah and His Blessings. Grand Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Head of the Council of Senior Scholars and the Council for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas. This hadeeth has also been dealt with in the answer to question no. 30765 in which Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen and the Standing Committee are quoted as saying that this hadeeth is da’eef (weak). And Allaah knows best."
Benefits of the Internet in spreading knowledge,"Question Assalammualaikum I would like to know, from your point of view, does the Internet bring any benefits to the Islamic society in terms of spreading information to the user??? Thank You.","Praise be to Allah.All Praises Are Due to Allah. The answer to your question is in what you see and not in what you hear. I don't think the issue needs to be addressed; however, your question must be regarding the negative and unlawful things found on the Internet, and not the positive aspects as they are clearly evident. There are in fact many down sides in the Internet, which contain great evil and this is what pushes one to think of the necessary ways to fix the ills on the Internet. It is the obligation of the experts from amongst the Muslims to work on this issue."
Types of turning away in prayer,Question I want to know whether turning away in prayer is an innovation (bid‘ah) or does it invalidate the prayer?,"Praise be to Allah.Turning away in prayer is of different types: 1. Turning away physically, by turning one’s chest away from the direction of the qiblah. This type of turning away invalidates the prayer, because facing towards the qiblah is one of the conditions of prayer being valid. For more information, please see the answer to question no. 65853 . 2. Turning away one’s head or eyes only, whilst the body remains facing towards the qiblah. This type of turning away is disliked (makrooh), unless the Muslim does it because he needs to. If he does it with no need, then he has undermined the reward for his prayer but it is still valid and is not rendered invalid by that. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/109): There is no difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ regarding the fact that it is disliked (makrooh) to turn away in prayer, because of the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: I asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about turning away in prayer and he said: “It is something that the Shaytaan steals from a person’s prayer.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (751). It is only disliked (makrooh) if it is done unnecessarily or without an excuse. But if there is a need for that, such as if the worshipper fears for himself or his property, then it is not disliked. End quote. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (7/27): Turning away in prayer is disliked and undermines its reward, but the one who turns away in prayer is not obliged to repeat his prayer, because in other hadiths there is evidence which indicates that it is permissible to turn away if there is a need to do so. Thus it is known that it does not invalidate the prayer. End quote. There are many hadiths which indicate that it is permissible to turn away in prayer if that is done for a reason, such as the report narrated by Muslim (431) from Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was sick, so we prayed behind him when he was sitting, and Abu Bakr made the people hear the takbeer. He turned to look at us and saw that we were standing, so he gestured to us that we should sit down, and we prayed behind him sitting. Abu Dawood (916) narrated that Sahl ibn al-Hanzaliyyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The iqaamah for prayer – meaning Fajr prayer – was given, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) began to pray whilst he kept turning and glancing up at the mountain pass.” Abu Dawood said: He had sent a rider to the mountain pass to stand guard overnight. Classed as saheeh by all-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is nothing wrong with turning away whilst praying to seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan when experiencing intrusive thoughts (waswasah); rather it is recommended (mustahabb) when there is an urgent need for it, but it should be done with the head only."" (Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn Baaz 11/130). 3. There is another type of turning away, which is turning away whilst praying in one’s heart, through thoughts that distract a person so that he does not focus and reflect on his prayer. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You should understand that turning away is of two types: 1. Turning away in a physical sense, which is turning the head; 2. Turning away in a metaphorical sense, in the heart. This refers to waswaas and passing thought that come to the heart. This is a problem that no one is free of; how difficult it is to treat it and how few are those who are safe from it. It undermines the prayer, and would that it was only in part of the prayer. But a person may turn away from the beginning of his prayer until the end, and it may truly be said that this is somethings that the Shaytaan steals from a person’s prayer."" (Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ 3/70). And Allah knows best."
"He borrowed money and the person to whom it was owed has died, and he does not know how to repay it","Question My husband’s father borrowed an amount of money before 1948, but he did not have enough money to pay it back, and the person whose money it was died. Then disaster befell Palestine and we were expelled from there. His financial position remained bad, then my husband’s father died, and my husband’s and my financial position was not good. Now my husband and I want to pay off this debt, knowing that we have been living in Saudi since 1967 and I do not know anything about the heirs of the man who lent the money. My husband has a brother who is out of work and has a family and handicapped children; his eyesight is very poor and he cannot work. So should we give this money to my husband’s brother with the intention of repaying this debt on behalf of the person who has died, and the charity will be on behalf of the one to whom that money belongs? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with all good.","Praise be to Allah. You have to look for the heirs of the person to whom this money belongs, trying all ways and means to find them and not be negligent in this matter, then you should give the money to them. If you are not able to do that, then give the money in charity with the intention that the reward should go to him (the owner), giving it in any charitable cause that will help to meet the needs of the Muslims. Our advice is not to give it to your husband’s brother, because that may be seen as favouritism, and lest he be accused of that and people slander his honour because of that."
Prohibition on describing the charms of another woman to one’s husband,Question Is there any hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbids a wife to tell her husband of the charms of another woman?.,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should look at or touch the body of another woman to describe her to her husband.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5240. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: Al-Qaabisi said: The reason for this prohibition is the fear that the husband may like the description and that may lead him to divorce the woman who gave the description or be tempted by the woman who was described to him. Fath al-Baari, 9/338; ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, 6/132; Fayd al-Qadeer, 9723. And Allaah knows best."
Fasting the Days of Tashriq,"Question I have the habit of fasting every Thursday and it so happened that I fasted on Thursday 12th Dhu’l-Hijjah. On the Friday, I heard that it is not permissible to fast on the Days of al-Tashreeq and that Thursday was the third of the days of al-Tashreeq. Is there any sin on me if I fasted that day? Is it true that it is not permissible to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq or should we avoid fasting only on the first days of Eid?","Praise be to Allah.Can you fast on Eid? Fasting on the two days of Eid is haraam, as indicated by the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on the day of al-Fitr and al-Nahr .” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1992; Muslim, 827) The scholars are unanimously agreed that fasting on these two days is haraam. Can you fast on Days of Tashreeq? It is also haraam to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq which are the three days after Eid al-Adha (the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhu’l-Hijjah). because tThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The days of al-Tashreeq are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1141) Abu Dawood (2418) narrated from Abu Murrah the freed slave of Umm Haani that he entered with ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr upon his father ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas. He offered them food and said, “Eat.” He said, “I am fasting.” ‘Amr said: “Eat, for these are the days on which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would tell us not to fast and forbade us to fast, and these are the days of al-Tashreeq .” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood) Can a pilgrim fast the Days of Tashreeq? But it is permissible to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq for a pilgrim who does not have a hadiy (sacrificial animal). It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) said: No one was allowed to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq except one who could not find a hadiy. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1998) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: “It is permissible for those who are doing Hajj qiraan or tamattu’, if they cannot find a hadiy, to fast these three days so that the Hajj season will not end before they fast. But apart from that it is not permissible to fast on these days, even if a person is obliged to fast for two consecutive months; he should not fast on the day of Eid and the three days following it, but then he should continue his fast.” (Fataawa Ramadaan, p. 727) See also questions no. 21049 and 36950 . And Allah knows best."
"If an eclipse happens at the time of Jumu‘ah prayer, which prayer should be done first?",Question What is the ruling if the time of an eclipse coincides with the time of Jumu‘ah prayer?,"Praise be to Allah. Firstly: If the sun is eclipsed on a Friday, if that occurs before Jumu‘ah at a time when there is sufficient time to do the ordinary eclipse prayer (salaat al-kusoof), such as if the eclipse occurs in the forenoon or close to it, then you should start with the eclipse prayer, then pray Jumu‘ah at the proper time. If the eclipse occurs at the time of Jumu‘ah, if there is the fear that Jumu‘ah prayer may be missed, then Jumu‘ah should be done first, according to scholarly consensus. If there is no risk of it being missed, then the majority of scholars are of the view that the eclipse prayer should be done first. The Hanbalis follow the view that was favoured by Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him), that Jumu‘ah should be done first, because starting with the eclipse prayer may lead to hardship for some people, because it will lead to keeping people back for the sake of praying the eclipse prayer and compelling them to pray it, when it is not obligatory in the first place. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/146): if two prayers occur at the same time, such as the eclipse prayer with another prayer such as Jumu‘ah or Eid or one of the obligatory prayers or Witr, then people should start with the one which they are more afraid of missing. If there is the fear that they may miss both, then they should start with the obligatory prayer. If neither of them is obligatory, such as the eclipse prayer and Witr or Taraweeh, then they should start with the one which is more emphasised. For example, in the case of the eclipse prayer and Witr, they should start with the eclipse prayer, because it is more emphasised, and for that reason it is Sunnah to offer it in congregation; moreover, Witr may be made up later on but the eclipse prayer cannot be made up later on. If Taraweeh and the eclipse prayer coincide, then which of them should be done first? There are two points of view concerning this. The view of our companions, and the correct view in my opinion, is that the obligatory prayer that is offered in congregation takes precedence over the eclipse prayer in all situations, because giving precedence to the eclipse prayer over it will cause hardship and will require the people present to offer the eclipse prayer even though it is not obligatory upon them, and will force them to wait for the obligatory prayer, even though among them there may be those who are physically weak, elderly or have needs to attend to. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to make the obligatory prayer brief, so that it would not cause undue hardship to those who are praying in congregation behind the imam. Hence it is more appropriate to say that we should not cause hardship by offering this lengthy and difficult prayer, even though it is not obligatory. The same ruling applies if it coincides with Taraweeh prayer; Taraweeh should be given precedence for the same reason. If the eclipse prayer coincides with Witr at the beginning of the time for Witr, it should be given precedence, because Witr will not be missed; if there is the fear that Witr will be missed, precedence should be given to Witr, because it is brief and can be done easily, and one can still catch up with the time of the eclipse prayer. If there is no time left except as much is needed to do Witr, then there is no need to undertake the eclipse prayer, because it has occurred at a time when prayer is not allowed. If the eclipse coincides with the time of a funeral prayer, the funeral prayer should be given precedence according to scholarly consensus, because there is concern for the deceased. And Allah knows best. End quote. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo‘ (5/61): ash-Shaafa‘i and his companions (may Allah have mercy on them) said: When two prayers coincide, precedence should be given to the one that it is feared may be missed, then that which is most emphasised. If Eid and the eclipse prayer coincide, or Jumu‘ah and the eclipse prayer, and there is the fear that the Eid prayer or Jumu‘ah prayer may be missed because there is not enough time, then precedence should be given to the Eid or Jumu‘ah prayer, because they are more emphasised than the eclipse prayer. If there is no fear of missing them, then the more correct view, which was stated categorically by the author [Abu Ishaaq ash-Shiraazi] and the majority, is that precedence should be given to the eclipse prayer, because there is the fear that it may be missed. End quote. See also: al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Foqhiyyah (27/258) What appears to be more correct is the view of Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him), because of what he mentioned about difficulty and hardship, and because Jumu‘ah is more emphasised and more important. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If two prayers coincide, the eclipse prayer and another prayer, such as an obligatory prayer, or Jumu‘ah prayer, or Witr, or Taraweeh, which should be given precedence? He replied: The obligatory prayer should be given precedence over the eclipse prayer (for solar or lunar eclipse), because it is more important, and because Allah, may He be exalted, said in the hadith qudsi: “My slave does not draw close to Me by means of anything more beloved to Me than that which I have made obligatory for him.” End quote from Majmoo‘ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (16/307) Secondly: If the imam begins with Jumu‘ah, he should deliver the khutbah then lead the Jumu‘ah prayer, then he should offer the eclipse prayer and deliver a khutbah for that. If he starts with the eclipse prayer and completes it, he should deliver a khutbah for Jumu‘ah and mention the eclipse in it, then pray Jumu‘ah, and the two Jumu‘ah khutbahs will suffice for the khutbah that is usually given with the eclipse prayer. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the book quoted from above: If Jumu‘ah and an eclipse coincide, and the situation requires giving precedence to Jumu‘ah, he should deliver the khutbah for it then pray Jumu‘ah, then offer the eclipse prayer, then give a khutbah for the eclipse. If the situation requires giving precedence to the eclipse prayer, he should start with it, then give the khutbah for Jumu‘ah, making mention of the eclipse in it and what is recommended in this situation in the two Jumu‘ah khutbahs, and there is no need for four khutbahs. Our companions said: This refers to the two Jumu‘ah khutbahs only. This was also stated by ash-Shaafa‘i in al-Umm. End quote. And Allah knows best."

This is one of the secrets of its perfection and its suitability to all times and places. Hence there are proven exceptions for three-dimensional toys in the hadiths that prohibit image making. That is in the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: I used to play with dolls in the house of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and I had friends who would play with me. When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came in they would hide from him (behind a curtain), but he would send them to play with me. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6130) and Muslim (2440) She (may Allah have mercy on her) also said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came back from the campaign to Tabook or Khaybar and there was a curtain over her niche. The wind lifted the edge of the curtain and uncovered ‘Aa’ishah’s toy dolls. He said: “What is this, O ‘Aa’ishah?” She said: My dolls. He saw among them a horse with two wings made of cloth and he said: “What is this that I see in the midst of them?” She said: A horse. He said: “What is this that I see on it?” I said: Two wings. He said: “A horse with wings?” She said: Have you not heard that Sulaymaan had horses with wings? She said: And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) smiled so broadly that I saw his eyeteeth.. Classed as saheeh by al-‘Iraaqi in Takhreej al-Ihya’ (2/344) and by al-Albaani. Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible to make images such as toy dolls, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to play with them in the house of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Narrated by Muslim. The wisdom behind that is to train girls to in childrearing. End quote from Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/434) The well-known view concerning the concession in this case is that it is for children, as was stated by more than one of the scholars, such as Ibn Battaal in Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari (9/304), and Badr ad-Deen al-‘Ayni in ‘Umdat al-Qaari (22/170) It may be said that the concession was only granted to girls in this case because there was a need for it, so if an adult needs such a thing, it is not far-fetched to suggest that a concession may be granted for him, as in the case of one who uses it to keep him away from things that are obviously haraam, and he finds it very difficult to do without it, as the questioner mentioned in his question. Thus he may be distracted by permissible kinds of entertainment from being tempted to sin and getting into trouble, and he may dispel boredom, and be content with that in order to keep away from an environment that is infested with sin. The smart person is the one who knows how to take care of himself and keep away from that which is haraam, and take a gradual approach until he reaches a point where he is completely safe, even if that leads to falling into some makrooh matters along the way. Imam an-Nasaa’i wrote a chapter in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8/179), in which he narrated that hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and called this chapter: “A man allowing his wife to play with dolls.” It appears like this, in general terms, without any limits based on the wife being young. Moreover, the incident in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw a toy horse that had two wings happened after the campaign to Khaybar or Tabook – the narrator was uncertain. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: At the time of the Khaybar campaign, ‘Aa’ishah was fourteen years old; she had either completed fourteen years, or passed that age, or was close to it. At the time of the Tabook campaign, she had definitely reached that age. End quote from Fath al-Baari (10/527) The point of mentioning that is to highlight that there is some degree of textual and rational evidence for lenience for grown-ups with regard to electronic games that do not contain any objectionable material, on condition that the grown-up who plays such games does not spend all his time playing them for the purpose of avoiding committing evil. Rather he should be involved in some useful activities, such as taking useful courses, joining study circles, participating in various Muslim community activities, and even working to create a Muslim community in an environment that is far removed from religion. Many people have succeeded in such efforts, praise be to Allah, and non-Muslims have even succeeded in achieving that in Muslim countries, so the Muslim is more deserving of reaching this goal than others. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to cartoon images that appear on television, if they are in the form of a human being, then the ruling on looking at them is ambiguous: should they be regarded like real pictures or not? The view that is most likely to be correct is that they are not to be regarded like real pictures. End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa (2/no. 333) On our website there are a number of other important guidelines concerning the ruling on electronic games. You can see them in the following fatwas: 2898, 39744, 97444, 98769, 121326. Conclusion: We hope that there will be nothing wrong with you playing this game, but that is on condition that this should not become a constant habit. Rather it should be like any other kind of game or leisure activity that is done from time to time. So try hard to do without it and fill your time with things that will benefit you, such as seeking beneficial knowledge and doing righteous deeds.

Touching the ‘awrah of a sick person and touching blood,"Question What is your opinion on the work of a doctor which sometimes requires him to see the ‘awrah of the patient or to touch it for the purpose of examination? Sometimes during operations the doctor makes an incision and gets a lot of blood and urine on his hands. Is it essential to repeat his wudoo’ in such cases, or it is preferable for him to do so?.","Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with the (male) doctor touching a man’s ‘awrah in cases of necessity, or looking at it for the purpose of medical treatment, whether that is the front or the back. He may look at it and touch it in cases of necessity. And there is nothing wrong with touching blood if there is a need to touch it during an operating in order to remove it or to check on the wound. He should wash his hands after that to remove any blood that may have gotten onto them. Touching blood or urine does not invalidate wudoo’, but if he touches the ‘awrah, whether front or back, this invalidates his wudoo’. But touching blood or urine, or other impure substances, does not invalidate wudoo’, rather he should wash off whatever gets onto his hands. But whoever touches the private parts without any barrier in between i.e., skin to skin, invalidates his wudoo’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever touches his private parts with his hand, with no barrier in between, must do wudoo’.” The same applies to a female doctor if she touches the private part of a woman for an essential reason, this invalidates her wudoo’ if she was in a state of purity, just as in the case of men."
Threefold divorce counts as one according to the correct scholarly opinion,Question My friend give divorce to wife in anger.he give three at one time.i read on internt at once three count only single divorec.can u tell me its true?and also i read that anger is three kind it true is well?.,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The fuqaha’ differed concerning the threefold divorce (talaaq). The correct view is that it counts as one divorce, whether it is uttered in a single phrase, such as saying “You are thrice divorced” or in repeated words such as saying, “You are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced.” This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and was the view regarded as most correct by Shaykh al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). They quoted as evidence the hadeeth narrated by Muslim (1472) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: At the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Abu Bakr and the first two years of ‘Umar’s caliphate, a threefold divorce was counted as one. Then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: People have become hasty in a matter in which they should take their time. I am thinking of holding them to it. So he made it binding upon them. Secondly: If a man divorces his wife in anger, one of three scenarios must apply: 1-His anger was mild and did not affect his will and choice, so his divorce is valid and counts as such. 2-His anger was so intense that he did not know or realize what he was saying. This divorce does not count as such because in this case he was like an insane person who is not to be brought to account for what he says. With regard to these two scenarios of anger, there is no difference of opinion among the scholars on the ruling. There remains the third scenario which is: 3-Intense anger which affects a person’s will and makes him speak words as if he is compelled to do so, but he soon regrets it as soon as his anger dissipates; but the anger does not reach the stage where he does not feel or realize what he is saying and cannot control his words or actions. The scholars differed concerning the ruling on this type of anger. The more correct view – as Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said – is that it does not count as such either, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no divorce and no manumission at the time of coercion.” Narrated by Ibn Majaah (2047); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’ (2047). Coercion here was interpreted by the scholars as referring to compulsion and intense anger. This view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and his student Ibn al-Qayyim who wrote a well known essay concerning that entitled Ighaathat al-Lahfaan fi Hukm Talaaq al-Ghadbaan. See the answer to question no. 45174. Based on this opinion, if your friend spoke the word of divorce at a moment of intense anger, then no divorce has taken place; if he was slightly angry, then it counts as one divorce. And Allaah knows best."
"If he gives his second wife the cost of tuition fees, is he obliged to give the same amount to his first wife?","Question I am married and I have three children. I took a second wife in secret, then my first wife found out about that later on. My question is: How can I treat them equitably? Should I give the first wife what I gave to the second of gold, clothing and mahr (dowry)? From what time should I start to treat them equitably? How should I do that when the second wife is studying at University, and every day I give her the cost of tuition? Should I give the first wife the same amount?","Praise be to Allah. Islam has made it incumbent upon the man who is married to more than one wife to treat his wives equitably in terms of spending on their maintenance. Equity in this case means spending on them according to his means, and giving each of them what she needs of maintenance and clothing, that is usually given to women like her. Based on that, one of them may need things that the other does not need in terms of maintenance. One who is studying may need, because of her study, things that the one who is not studying does not need. One who is pregnant may need maintenance that one who is not pregnant does not need. One who is sick may need things that the one who is not sick does not need, and so on. The point is that he is obliged to treat them equitably in terms of maintenance, so as to suffice each one of them. With regard to anything more than what is sufficient, he is not obliged to treat them equitably in that regard. Ibn Qudaamah said: He does not have to treat his wives equally in terms of maintenance and clothing if he has done what is obligatory in the case of each one of them. Ahmad said – concerning a man who had two wives: He may favour one of them over the other in terms of maintenance, intimacy and clothing, so long as the other one is provided for sufficiently. He may buy a garment for one that is more expensive, so long as the other one is adequately clothed. That is because equal treatment in all these matters is difficult, and if it was made obligatory, he would not be able to do it except with great difficulty. Thus this obligation is waived, as in the case of equal treatment in terms of intimacy. End quote from al-Mughni, 7/232 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: If he has fulfilled his obligations towards each one of them in terms of clothing, maintenance and spending the night, then it does not matter if he inclines more towards one of them or gives a gift to one of them. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 9/391 For more information, please see question no. 10091 Based on the above, what you must do is treat them equitably by spending on each one of them that which is sufficient for her. You do not have to give the first wife what you spent on the mahr and then on clothing and gold for the second one. And Allah knows best."
Who are Banu Qurayzah? What happened to them?,Question Who are the bani qurayzah? What happened to them? I read a line about it in your answer to the signs of a childs reaching of puberty.,"Praise be to Allah. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) migrated from Makkah to Madinah, there were three Jewish tribes in Madinah: Banu Qaynuqaa‘, Banu an-Nadeer and Banu Qurayzah. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) invited them to Islam, but most of them insisted on disbelieving. He drew up a covenant with them (i.e., a binding contract) then they waged war against him. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: All three (Jewish tribes) waged war against him. He let off Banu Qaynuqaa‘, expelled Banu an-Nadeer, and killed Banu Qurazah and took their women and children captive. Soorat al-Hashr was revealed concerning Banu an-Nadeer, and Soorat al-Ahzaab was revealed concerning Banu Qurayzah. Zaad al-Ma‘aad (3/59) Secondly: To sum up what the scholars of seerah and maghaazi (Prophet’s biography and military campaigns) said about Banu Qurayzah: When the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) finished digging the trench, Quraysh came with ten thousand of their ahaabeesh (a group of people who did not belong to any one tribe) and those who followed them of Banu Kinaanah and the people of Tihaamah, and Ghatafaan came with those who followed them of the people of Najd. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Muslims came out until they put their backs towards Sal‘ – a mountain in Madinah – with three thousand Muslims. He set up his camp there, and the trench was between him and the enemy. He issued orders that the children and women be taken up into the forts, and he appointed Ibn Umm Maktoom in charge of Madinah. Huyayy ibn Akhtab al-Nadari set out and went to Ka‘b ibn Asad al-Qurazi, who was the one who had made a treaty and covenant (with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) on behalf of Banu Qurayzah. When Ka‘b heard about that, he shut the door of his fort in Huyayy’s face. He asked permission to enter, but he refused to open the door to him, so he called out to him: Woe to you, O Ka‘b! Open the door! Ka‘b said: Woe to you, O Huyayy! You are a man of ill omen and I have made a treaty with Muhammad; I will not break the treaty between me and him, for I have not seen anything from him but faithfulness and truthfulness. Huyayy said: Woe to you! Open the door so that I may speak to you. And he kept on him until he opened the door, then he kept pleading with him until he agreed to break his treaty with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), on condition that Huyayy give him a solemn pledge by Allah that if Quraysh and Ghatafaan went back without having killed Muhammad, he would enter his fort with him and share his fate. Thus Ka‘b ibn Asad broke his treaty and freed himself from the covenant that had been between him and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). When the news reached the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Muslims, he sent Sa‘d ibn Mu‘aadh, who was the chief of al-Aws at that time, and Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah, who was the chief of al-Khazraj, along with ‘Abdullah ibn Rawaahah and Khawwaat ibn Jubayr, who went to them, to call them to make peace and renew the alliance. They said: Now after you have weakened us and has expelled them, meaning Banu an-Nadeer?! And they spoke disparagingly of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him. Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaadah began to trade insults with them, then Sa‘d ibn Mu‘aadh called out to them: You know what there is between us and you, O Banu Qurayzah, and I fear for you a fate like that of Banu an-Nadeer or even worse. But they reviled him and spoke disparagingly of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). They said: Who is the Messenger of Allah? There is no covenant or agreement between us and Muhammad. So Sa‘d ibn Mu‘aadh traded insults with them, and he was a hot tempered man. They went back to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened, and the situation became serious and fear was everywhere. Their enemy came at them from above and below until the believers thought all sorts of things and hypocrisy rose to the surface. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood on guard, and the mushrikeen continued to besiege him for twenty-odd days, nearly a month, but there was no fighting between them apart from some shooting with arrows. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions remained as Allah described it, in a state of hardship and fear, because their enemy gathered together against them and came at them from above and below. Then Nu‘aym ibn Mas‘ood came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I have become Muslim and my people do not know that I have become Muslim; instruct me as you wish. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You are just one man among us; try to stir up division among them so as to weaken their resolve if you can, for war is deceit.” Nu‘aym ibn Mas‘ood went out and came to Banu Qurayzah, as he had been a friend of theirs during the Jaahiliyyah. He said to them: Quraysh and Ghatafaan have come to fight Muhammad and his Companions, and you have supported them against him, and their land, their women and their wealth are elsewhere, so they are not like you. If they see an opportunity, they will take it, otherwise they will go back to their own country and leave you alone with the man in your country, and you will not be able to stand up to him if you are left alone. So do not fight with these people until you take hostages from among their leaders, who will be in your hands as a guarantee so that you will fight Muhammad with them until you defeat him. And they said: You have given good advice. Then he went to Quraysh and said to Abu Sufyaan ibn Harb and the men of Quraysh who were with him: You should know that the Jews regret what has happened between them and Muhammad, and they have sent word telling him: We regret what we did; will it please you if we capture some of the leaders of the two tribes, Quraysh and Ghatafaan, and give them to you so that you may strike their necks, then we will be with you against whoever among them is left until we eradicate them? And he has sent word to them agreeing to that. So if the Jews send anyone to you, asking you for hostages from among your men, do not give them even one man. Then he went out and came to Ghatafaan and said something similar to them as he had said to Quraysh, and issued a similar warning to them. Then Allah created dissent among them. And Allah sent a wind on an intensely cold winter’s night, which overturned their cooking pots and tents. And Allah, may He be exalted, revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Remember Allah's Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [i.e. troops of angels during the battle of AlAhzab (the Confederates)]. And Allah is Ever All-Seer of what you do… . And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in their rage, they gained no advantage (booty, etc.). Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting (by sending against the disbelievers a severe wind and troops of angels). And Allah is Ever All-Strong, All-Mighty. And those of the people of the Scripture who backed them (the disbelievers) Allah brought them down from their forts and cast terror into their hearts, (so that) a group (of them) you killed, and a group (of them) you made captives. And He caused you to inherit their lands, and their houses, and their riches, and a land which you had not trodden (before). And Allah is Able to do all things.” [al-Ahzaab 33:9-27]. That is, Allah diverted their enemy from them by means of the wind that He sent against them and the troops of angels and others whom Allah sent to them. “Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting” means: they did not need to engage in fighting with them; rather the Most Strong, the Almighty, diverted them by His might and power. Al-Bukhaari (4114) and Muslim (2724) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no god but Allah alone, He granted victory to His troops, supported His slave and defeated the confederates alone, and there is nothing after Him.” When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) returned from the battle of the Trench, and laid down his weapon and did ghusl – as narrated by al-Bukhaari (4117) – Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to him and said: Have you laid down your arms? For by Allah, we (angels) have not laid down ours; go out to them. He said: “Where to?” He said: Over there – and he pointed in the direction of Banu Qurayzah. So the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) went out to them, and besieged them with detachments of Muslims for umpteen days. Allah cast fear into their hearts and the siege became intense, until they agreed to accept the ruling of Sa‘d ibn Mu‘aadh, as they had been his allies. His verdict concerning them was in accordance with the ruling of Allah: their fighters were to be killed and their women and children taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) detained them in Madinah, then he went out to the marketplace of Madinah and dug trenches in it, then he sent for them and struck their necks in those trenches as they were brought out to him in batches. They said to Ka‘b ibn Asad as they were being taken to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in batches: O Ka‘b, what do you think will be done to us? He said: Will you never understand? Don’t you see that the caller does not stop and that whoever among you is taken away does not return? By Allah it is death. And this went on until they were finished with. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) issued instructions to execute every one of them who had grown pubic hair, and whoever had not grown pubic hair was left alone. Abu Dawood (4404) narrated with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Atiyyah al-Qurazi (may Allah be pleased with him) he said: I was among the captives of Banu Qurayzah, and they examined (us). Those whose pubes had started to grow were executed and those whose pubes had not started to grow were not executed. I was among those whose pubes had not started to grow. According to another report: They uncovered my private part and saw that my pubes had not yet started to grow, so they put me with the captive women and children. See: al-Bidaayah wa’n-Nihaayah (6/34-94); Siyar A‘laam an-Nubala’ (1/470-480); Tareekh al-Islam (2/307-318); ar-Rawd al-Unuf (6/262-294) Thus the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) put an end to the Jews of Banu Qurayzah who broke the treaty and formed an alliance with the mushrikeen to eradicate Islam and its people. So their plot backfired and they themselves were eradicated to the last man. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.

"If an apostate repents, does he have to make up the fasts that he missed before he apostatised?","Question Someone apostatised from Islam then came back, and before he apostatised he had some fasts that he had to make up. Does he still have to make them up, or are they waived in his case because Islam erases that which came before it? Does the ruling include the days for which he is not certain whether he has to make them up, on which he did some things which he does not know whether they broke the fast or not?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The scholars differed regarding this issue, and there are two views: The view of the Malikis is that if the apostate becomes Muslim, he is not obliged to make up what he had missed of prayers or fasts before he apostatised. In that regard, he is like a disbeliever who becomes Muslim. But they limited that to one who did not apostatise so that the obligation of making up the missed acts of worship will be waived for him. If he did that, then making them up is not waived for him, as a punishment to him for his bad intention. Al-Kharashi said in Sharh Qawl Khalil: Prayer, fasting, zakah and Hajj are waived, as explained above. What is meant is that if one who is accountable fell short in acts of worship such as prayer, fasting or zakah before he apostatised, then he repented and came back to Islam, he is not to be instructed to make them up. That is waived in his case, because Islam erases what came before it, and he becomes like a disbeliever who just became Muslim. But what he did of Hajj before he apostatised is not valid; rather he has to do the obligatory Hajj. We should not here that the ruling concerning shortcomings in these acts of worship applies provided that he did not intend his apostasy for the purpose of waiving them; if he did that, then they are not waived in his case. The majority are of the view that it is obligatory to make up the acts of worship that he did not do before he apostatised. It says in al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/201): If the apostate who has repented owed any prayers, fasts or zakah that he missed before he apostatised, does he have to make them up? The majority of Hanafi, Shafa‘i and Hanbali jurists are of the view that he is obliged to make them up, because failing to do an act of worship is a sin, and sins remain after apostatising. End quote. Secondly: If the apostate repents, he does not have to make up the prayers and fasts that he did not do during the time when he was an apostate, because repentance erases what came before it. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the apostate, he does not have to make up what he missed of prayer, zakah and fasting during the time when he was an apostate, according to the well-known view, but he must make up what he missed before he apostatised, according to the well-known view.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa 22/10). Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Does the apostate have to make up prayers and fasts when he comes back to Islam and repents to Allah? He replied: He does not have to make them up. When someone repents, Allah turns to him in mercy, and if a person does not pray, or he does any of the things that nullify Islam, then Allah guides him and he repents, then he does not have to make up [the missed acts of worship]. This is the correct scholarly view, because Islam erases what came before it, and repentance erases what came before it. Allah, He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them} [al-Anfal 8:38]. Thus Allah stated that if the disbeliever becomes Muslim, Allah will forgive him his previous sins. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Repentance erases that which came before it, and Islam erases that which came before it.”""(Majmu‘ Fatawa Ibn Baz 29/196).

It is not permissible to buy bank shares or deal in them,Question It is not permissible to buy bank shares or deal in them,"Praise be to Allah.Bank shares are in fact money, and based on this it is not permissible to buy or sell bank shares because that is selling money for money without meeting the conditions of equal amounts and concluding the exchange in one sitting. Moreover the banks are riba-based institutions and it is not permissible to cooperate with them by either buying or selling, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment” [al-Maa'idah 5:2] And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one to whom it is given, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said they are all the same. Narrated by Imam Muslim. All that you are entitled to is your capital. My advice to you and to other Muslims is to beware of all riba-based transactions and to warn against them, and to repent to Allaah from any such transactions you may have engaged in in the past, because riba-based transactions are a kind of war against Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and are one of the causes of the wrath and punishment of Allaah, and He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who eat Ribaa will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Ribaa,’ whereas Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden Ribaa. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Ribaa), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein” [al-Baqarah 2:275] And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. 279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [al-Baqarah 2:278-279] And please note the hadeeth referred to above."
The Islamic attitude towards low-status and high-status occupations and jobs,"Question Are there any jobs and occupations that are regarded as low-status or high-status in Islam? Is a person’s keenness to strive for a high position in his job contrary to the idea of contentment [with the divine decree]? When does ambition contradict contentment? Is a person’s keenness to work in jobs that are held in high esteem by society contrary to zuhd [lack of interest in worldly matters] and not making this world one’s main focus, or is it something normal that is not forbidden by Islamic teachings?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Allah has made this world a means of reaching the hereafter, and a means by which a person may prepare himself for the hereafter. Hence Allah has stated in His Book that He has subjugated the earth and everything in it to people. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth} [al-Baqarah 2:29] {It is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision - and to Him is the resurrection} [al-Mulk 67:15]. Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is: so travel around in it wherever you wish, from one country to another, for the purpose of seeking different kinds of earning and trade.""(Tafsir Ibn Kathir 8/179). Many verses and hadiths urge the Muslim to seek a livelihood and travel about in the earth, all for the purpose of acquiring wealth, not merely for the sake of accumulation, but so that he will not have to ask of others, and so that he may uphold ties of kinship with it and use it to do righteous deeds and obey his Lord. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the virtue and importance of wealth: Allah, may He be glorified, has called wealth khayr (lit. “good”) in more than one place in His Book, such as the verses in which He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Prescribed for you when death approaches [any] one of you if he leaves khayr [wealth] [is that he should make] a bequest for the parents and near relatives} [al-Baqarah 2:180] {And indeed he is, in love of khayr [wealth], intense} [al-‘Adiyat 100:8]. Allah, may He be glorified, has told us that He has made wealth a means of maintaining life, and He has enjoined us to take care of it. He has forbidden giving it to those who are legally incompetent among women, children and others. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) praised wealth when he said: “How good is lawful wealth for a righteous man.” Narrated by Ahmad with a sahih isnad. Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab said: There is nothing good in one who does not want to acquire wealth by lawful means, so that he will not have to ask of people, and he can uphold ties of kinship with it and give what is due on it. Abu Ishaq as-Subay‘i said: They used to regard wealth as a help in fulfilling religious duties. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: What a good help in maintaining piety wealth is! Sufyan ath-Thawri said: Wealth in our time is the weapon of the believer. Yusuf ibn Subat said: Wealth has never been at any time since the world was created more beneficial than it is in this time. Allah, may He be glorified, has made wealth a means of maintaining physical wellbeing, and taking care of it is a means of maintaining spiritual wellbeing, so that one will be able to learn about Allah, believe in Him, believe in His Messengers, love Him, and turn to Him. Thus wealth is the means of prosperity in this world and the hereafter. One of the benefits of wealth is that it is the basis of acts of worship and obedience. By means of it Hajj and jihad become possible, by means of it one is able to spend in the ways that are obligatory and encouraged, and by means of it one is able to do righteous deeds such as manumitting slaves, establishing waqfs (endowments), building mosques and bridges, and other good deeds. By means of it one becomes able to get married, which is better than focusing completely on supererogatory acts of worship. By means of it, people attain dignity; by means of it people are able to spend generously; by means of it people’s honour is protected; by means of it one may connect to brothers and friends; and by means of it the righteous attain the highest levels and will be in the company of those whom Allah has favoured. It is something by means of which one may ascend to the highest chambers of Paradise or drop therefrom to the lowest of the low. By means of it a person may attain glory. One of the early generations used to say: There is no glory except through action, and there is no action except by means of wealth. One of them used to say: O Allah, I am one of your slaves for whom nothing is good except wealth. It is one of the means of attaining Allah’s good pleasure, just as it is one of the means of incurring His wrath.""(‘Iddat as-Sabirin p. 221-223). In order to attain these noble goals by means of wealth, the Prophets strove in different occupations and crafts, and did various kinds of work. According to a hadith narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah never sent any prophet but he tended sheep.” His companions said: Even you? He said: “Yes. I used to tend them for the people of Makkah in return for a few coins.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2134). Similarly, our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) worked in trade with his uncle Abu Taalib, and then worked in trade using the wealth of his wife Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), as is well known in his biography. According to the hadith narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Zakariyya was a carpenter.” Narrated by Muslim (2379). Allah, may He be exalted, tells us about the work of Dawud (peace be upon him), as He says (interpretation of the meaning): {And We taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your [enemy in] battle. So will you then be grateful} [al-Anbiya’ 21:80]. It was narrated from Khalid ibn Ma‘dan from al-Miqdam (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), who said: “No one ever eats any food better than that which he eats from the earnings of his own hands. The Prophet of Allah Dawud (peace be upon him) used to eat from the earnings of his own hands.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1966). Dawud (peace be upon him) was a Prophet and a king, to whom Allah gave great dominion, yet despite that he (peace be upon him) used to eat from the earnings of his own hands; he used to make chainmail from iron and sell it. Islam affirms the principle of travelling about in the land and seeking provision. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Dhu Majaz and ‘Ukaz were marketplaces for the people during the Jahiliyyah. When Islam came, it was as if they disliked that, until the verse {There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord [during hajj]} [al-Baqarah 2:198] was revealed. Narrated by al-Bukhari (1681). The jurists and scholars of hadith have stated that. In his Sahih, al-Bukhari gave a chapter in the Book of Sales the title: Going out to do trade and the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: {disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of Allah} [al-Jumu‘ah 62:10]. Then he quoted the hadith of Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari with ‘Umar, and the words of ‘Umar: I was distracted [from learning about that] by making business deals in the marketplaces. Narrated by al-Bukhari (1956) and Muslim (2153). Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ibn al-Munayyir said in al-Hashiyah: What al-Bukhari meant, that it is permissible to move about for the purpose of trade even if the distance is far, is different from what those with extreme views thought, who did not even go to the marketplace.""(Fath al-Bari 4/349). Al- Bukhari also included chapters with titles such as: Chapter on travelling for trade by sea; Chapter on what was said about the goldsmith; Chapter on blacksmiths; Chapter on tailors; Chapter on weavers; Chapter on carpenters… And so on By including these chapter headings and the hadiths listed under them, al-Bukhari wanted to show that it is prescribed to work and have a profession or occupation. What some people think, that Islam does not urge people to work and earn a livelihood, is not correct. What many people think about some occupations – such as carpentry, blacksmithing and tending flocks – being lowly, is not correct, and to refute that view it is sufficient to note that these were the occupations and work of the best of Allah’s creation, namely the Prophets and Messengers (peace be upon them). Secondly: Islam does not prevent one from seeking a high-status occupation and a good job. Rather Islam encourages that and urges the individual to seek a better level and better situation; in fact, he should seek what is best and strive to attain it, on condition that he does not give precedence to that over his faith and pursuit of righteousness. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good.” Narrated by Muslim (2664). The word good (khayr) is indefinite and includes what is good in this world and the hereafter. Islam dislikes people to do some base and lowly occupations, and instructs the Muslim to rise above that, as it says in the hadith which was narrated from Ibn Muhayyisah from his father, that he asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) for permission to charge a fee for cupping and he told him not to do that. He kept asking him and seeking permission until he told him to feed his watering camel and his slave with it [those earnings]. Narrated by Muslim (2664), and by at-Tirmidhi (1277), who classed it as hasan. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars differed regarding this issue – the earnings of a cupper. The majority were of the view that it is permissible… And they said: They are somewhat lowly and undignified earnings, but they are not haram. They interpreted the Prophet’s rebuke as meaning that it is makruh (disliked), not haram.""(Fath al-Bari 4/459). And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The fact that it is lowly does not mean that it is not prescribed or permissible. The street sweeper is of a lower status than a cupper, but if all people refused to do this job, that would harm everyone.""(Fath al-Bari 4/324). Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Rather the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) disliked it [cupping] for a free man, by way of thinking that it is beneath him, because this occupation is regarded as base and lowly. The fact that he instructed him to feed his slave from the earnings indicates that it is permissible. Thus his prohibiting him from eating from those earnings himself should be understood as meaning that it is makruh (disliked), not haram.""(Al-Mughni 6/133). Thus we may conclude that there are some occupations and jobs that people may traditionally regard as lowly, such as cupping, collecting trash, working in the sewers, and so on. But we may point out the following: 1. The fact that they are lowly occupations does not mean that it is prohibited to work in them, as we have explained above. 2. These occupations may be appropriate for some people, because they are not good at other things, for example. So doing these jobs is better than being idle and unemployed and receiving charity from people. 3. Undoubtedly the Muslim society needs these occupations, and they are essential. If the trash is not collected for a few days, life will become difficult in that community, and will lead to the spread of diseases and epidemics. Therefore it is obligatory for the Muslim state to be generous in paying those who do these jobs, so as to encourage them, and so that there will not be a time when no one does this work. 4. Those who do these jobs should not be shamed or looked down on, such as those who had no opportunity for education, or are feebleminded, or are faced with particular circumstances that compelled them to work in these occupations. The one who works in such an occupation is undoubtedly better than the one who begs from people and exposes himself to humiliation. Thirdly: The fact that Islam urges the Muslim to seek the highest level in both religious and worldly terms is not contrary to contentment with the divine decree and what Allah has allotted to him, because one of the means of attaining that is taking appropriate measures. So taking the measures that Allah has created by His wisdom will lead, in most cases, to attaining one’s goals. But if a person seeks a livelihood by means other than what Allah has permitted, such as seeking it through sinful actions, cheating, deceit, lying, or bribery, and his main concern is to attain these worldly gains without intending to use them in obedience to Allah, then this is a sign of discontentment with what Allah has allotted to him, and he has fallen into sin. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave a vivid likeness of a man’s eagerness for wealth and status. In the hadith it was narrated that Ka‘b ibn Malik al-Ansari said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Two hungry wolves sent against a flock of sheep do not cause more damage to the flock than a man’s eagerness for wealth and status does to his faith.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2376); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sunan at-Tirmidhi. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Undoubtedly desire for wealth and status in this world is harmful, as at-Tirmidhi narrated from Ka‘b ibn Malik al-Ansari, who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Two hungry wolves sent against a flock of sheep do not cause more damage to the flock than a man’s eagerness for wealth and status does to his faith.” And he [at-Tirmidhi] said: It is a hasan sahih hadith. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) condemned eagerness for wealth and status – which means leadership and prominence – and stated that that damages faith like, or more than, the damage that two hungry wolves cause to a flock of sheep.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa 20/142). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The wealth that is condemned is that which is earned in an inappropriate manner and spent in an inappropriate manner, and the one who earns it becomes a slave to it, so that it controls his thoughts and distracts him from Allah and the hereafter. So what is condemned is that which helps the one who acquires it to achieve corrupt aims and goals, or distracts him from praiseworthy aims and goals. What is condemned is the one who abuses it, not the wealth itself. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Wretched is the slave of the dinar and dirham and fine clothing.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2730). He condemned the one who is a slave to these things, not these things themselves… ‘Uddat as-Sabirin (p. 221, 222). As for having little interest in this world (zuhd), it is not contrary to seeking wealth and working in high-status occupations. Regarding that, please see the answer to question no. 105352 . Finally, it should be noted that seeking high status occupations and high status positions is not permissible except for one who attains them in a rightful manner and uses them in a rightful manner. As for the one who attains them in an improper manner, or does not fear Allah regarding this position or use it in a rightful manner – rather he uses it as a means to oppress and suppress people, or look down on them, or accumulate wealth even if it comes from haram sources – such positions and leadership will be a cause of doom on the Day of Resurrection for the one who attained it. Regarding that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You will be very keen to attain positions of authority, but they will be a cause of regret on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7148). Muslim (1825) narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): O Messenger of Allah, will you not appoint me (to a position of authority)? He struck me on the shoulder with his hand and said: “O Abu Dharr, you are weak and it is a trust, and on the Day of Resurrection it will be a source of humiliation and regret, except for the one who takes it and fulfils all obligations and does all duties required.” An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahih Muslim: This hadith offers clear evidence that one should avoid positions of authority, especially in the case of one who is weak and unable to carry out the duties required in that position of authority. As for humiliation and regret, they are inevitable in the case of one who is not qualified for that, or was qualified but was not fair in carrying out his duties. Allah, may He be exalted, will humiliate and shame him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will regret his negligence. As for the one who was qualified for that position of authority and he was fair in carrying out his duties, he will attain immense reward, as is indicated by many sound hadiths, such as the hadith which mentions the seven whom Allah will shade [with His shade on the Day of Resurrection] and other hadiths, and the Muslims are unanimously agreed on that. However, because there is such great danger in that, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned against it, and the scholars also warned against it, and many of the early generations refused to accept such positions, and bore with patience the persecution they faced when they refused. End quote. And Allah knows best."
Ruling on saying “Life is no good”,Question Does saying “Life is no good” come under the heading of inveighing against time?,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Prohibition on inveighing against time It is proven that it is prohibited to inveigh against time, as is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted and glorified said: ‘The son of Adam offends Me; he inveighs against time (dahr), and I am time, in My hand are all affairs, I alternate the night and day.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4826) and Muslim (2246). According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Do not inveigh against time, for Allah is time.” The reason for this prohibition is that this inveighing includes one of two grave evils: by saying this, the one who is inveighing is either attributing the creation of events to time, in which case he is associating something else with Allah, may He be exalted, or he believes that these events, for which he is inveighing against time, are decreed by Allah, may He be exalted, in which case he is condemning Allah, may He be exalted – we ask Allah to protect us from that. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ash-Shaafa‘i said, commenting on that – and Allah knows best – that the Arabs used to inveigh against time and condemn it when calamities befell them, such as death, destruction, loss of wealth or other calamities. They would say: We have been struck by the vicissitudes of time, time has eradicated them, time has struck them, and nights and days are doing that to them. Thus they condemned time and inveighed against it. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not inveigh against time (dahr),” thinking that it is time that is doing that to you, for if you inveigh against the one that does that, then you are inveighing against Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, for He is the One Who does all of that, for He does all things and nothing happens except what Allah, the Most High, the Almighty, wills."" (al-Istidhkaar 27/310). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The one who inveighs against time inevitably falls into one of two errors: either he is inveighing against Allah or he is associating something with Him. If he believes that time does things alongside Allah, then he is a mushrik (one who associates others with Allah), and if he believes that Allah alone is the One Who does that, and he is inveighing against the one who does it, then he is inveighing against Allah."" (Zaad al-Ma‘aad 2/324). Secondly: The ruling on saying “Life is no good.” The reason for the prohibition mentioned above is not applicable in the case of saying “Life is not good,” because in this phrase there is no attribution of any action to this life for which it may be condemned. Rather it is just describing what a person feels towards life. But we should look at what he means and what prompted him to say that. If it is by way of expressing discontent and lack of patience in bearing the decrees of Allah, may He be exalted, in this life, this is not allowed, as is well known to every Muslim. But if his aim in saying this is to convince himself of how insignificant this life is, and that man is constantly striving and toiling in this life, and that rest and a true, beautiful life is only to be found in Paradise, so he is saying that there is no goodness in this life in comparison to life in Paradise, then this is something that is acceptable according to Islamic teachings, as we see in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Say, The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for he who fears Allah. And injustice will not be done to you, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed]} [an-Nisa’ 4:77]. There is a great deal of condemnation of this life in the religious texts and the words of the righteous, which speak against being attached to it, highlight the troubles man faces in it and condemn those who are attached to it and distracted by it from obedience to Allah and seeking the path that leads to Paradise. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is cursed and everything in it is cursed, except remembrance of Allah and what is connected to that, or a knowledgeable man, or a seeker of knowledge.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2322), who said: It is hasan ghareeb. It was also classed as hasan by Ibn al-Qayyim in ‘Iddat as-Saabireen (260) and by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (2797). It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed through the marketplace, coming in from part of al-‘Aaliyah, and the people were around him. He passed by a dead lamb with very small ears, and he took hold of its ear and said: “Who among you would like to have this for a dirham?” They said: We would not like to have it for anything; what would we do with it? He said: “Would you like to have it?” They said: By Allah, even if it were alive, it has a defect because its ears are too small, so how about if it is dead? He said: “By Allah, this world is more insignificant to Allah than this is to you.” Narrated by Muslim (2957). Conclusion: there is nothing wrong with saying that or condemning this world by way of highlighting how insignificant it is and how bad it is to be distracted by it from seeking the pleasure of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and by way of [??] feeling sad for what one misses out on of its glamour and gains. And Allah knows best."
Authenticity of “Religion is How You Deal With Others”,Question How sound is this hadeeth: “Religion is how you deal with others”?,"Praise be to Allah.This is not a hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no basis for it in the books of the Sunnah prophetic teachings). It was mentioned by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in the introduction to the fifth volume of Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah, p.11. He said concerning it: There is no basis for this, not even among the fabricated ahadeeth! End quote. Al-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about it and he said: This is not a hadeeth, rather it is a saying of the people. End quote. And Allah knows best."
Are the compilation of the Qur’aan and the first adhaan for Jumu’ah forms of bid’ah (innovation)?,Question if bidah is wrong· then what about the quran being compiled? and other things such as umar introducing something in the azan? please make this clear as some people say good bidah is allowed· relating it to one of the prophets hadith?,"Praise be to Allah.For a correct definition of bid’ah and guidelines concerning it, please see Questions no. 864, 205, 10843. With regard to what you mention about Abu Bakr compiling the Qur’aan, this is not bid’ah, rather it is Sunnah such as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined us to adhere to when he said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs after me.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2676; Abu Dawood, 4607; Ibn Maajah, 42. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, by al-Haakim, 1/177; and by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2549, from the hadeeth of al-‘Irbaad ibn Saariyah). This is one of the Sunnahs of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefah Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him). Bid’ah means seeking to draw close to Allaah by means of acts of worship for which there is no precedent (in sharee’ah). The Qur’aan was compiled in people’s hearts and it was compiled on tablets kept by some of the Sahaabah. Compiling all of it in one place or on one tablet does not involve anything that is to be denounced. Zayd ibn Thaabit said – when Abu Bakr delegated him to collect the Mus-haf – I sought the Qur’aan and I gathered it from pieces, i.e., leaves, patches of leather, shoulder-blades of sheep and camels, leaves of palm trees, and the hearts of men. Al-Qaadi Abu Bakr al-Baaqillaani mentioned the justification for the action of Abu Bakr, the five most important points of which were: 1 – That the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do that for a reason, and Abu Bakr did it because there was a need for it. 2 – Allaah referred in the Qur’aan to al-Suhuf al-Oola (the former Scriptures – al-A’laa 89:19], and He stated that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had something similar in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning]: “reciting (the Qur’aan) purified pages [purified from Al-Baatil (falsehood)]. Wherein are correct and straight laws from Allaah” [al-Bayyinah 98:2-3] So this [action of Abu Bakr] was following that which was prescribed by Allaah and His Messenger. 3 – By doing that, their intention was to fulfil the words of Allaah: “Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9] It was preserved with Him, and He told us that He would preserve it after it had been sent down. Part of His preserving it was His enabling the Sahaabah to gather it and to agree upon how its spelling and punctuation were to be regulated. 4 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had scribes to whom he dictated it, so that everyone would understand from this that it should be written down and preserved on sheets. If Allaah’s guarantee to preserve it meant that the ummah would have nothing to do with it, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have had it written down after Allaah had told him of His guarantee to preserve it. But it is known that the way in which Allaah has preserved it is by causing us to preserve it and making that easy for us, and showing us how it is to be written down. 5 – It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade traveling with the Qur’aan to the land of the enemy. This indicates that it was written down and that the people used to take it with them when they travelled. Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: this is the clearest evidence for anyone who studies the issue. See Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 2/612 With regard to your saying that ‘Umar added “something new” to the adhaan, we know nothing of that. But perhaps you were referring to the fact that ‘Uthmaan added the first call to the Jumu’ah prayers. This is correct, because at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), there was just one adhaan, but when ‘Uthmaan became khaleefah and Madeenah became larger, ‘Uthmaan thought that the call for Jumu’ah should be given before the time, so the people could get ready for the prayer. This is what is called the first adhaan. It was narrated that al-Saa’ib ibn Yazeed said: At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, the first call on Friday used to be when the imaam was sitting on the minbar. But at the time of ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him), when the number of people increased, he added the third call. According to one report, ‘Uthmaan gave orders for the first call. According to another report, the second adhaan was enjoined by ‘Uthmaan. There is no contradiction here, because it is called the third call in the sense that it was something added; the first in the sense that it comes before the adhaan and iqaamah; and the second in the sense that this is an adhaan given in addition to the real adhaan, which was given in al-Zawraa’. Abu ‘Abd-Allaah – i.e., al-Bukhaari – said that al-Zawraa’ was a place in the market of Madeenah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 870. This adhaan is not a bid’ah or reprehensible innovation, rather it is one of the Sunnahs of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefah ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him), which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to adhere to when he said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs after me.” Moreover there is a sound reason behind it, which is to alert the people to the fact that the time of prayer is at hand. And it is worth noting that there are no rulings attached to this (first) adhaan, such as the prohibition on buying or selling or the obligation to go to the mosque, and that ‘Uthmaan was wise to have this call made in the marketplace and not in the mosque. This is no more than an alert to the people, to let them know that the time for prayer is at hand, because the houses were far away and far from one another, as mentioned above. Hence it was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) did not do that in Kufa because there was no need for it. And Allaah knows best."
Marrying without her father’s knowledge,"Question I am looking at a lengthy engagement period before my fiance and I am able to financially marry and live together. We would both like to have a nikkah during our engagement so that we are not sinning when we are intimate with each other. However, both of our parents are against this and want us to wait until our marriage reception which is in a year or so. Is it allowed for us to get a nikkah in secret? My second question is, is it ok for us to repeat the nikkah ceremony again during our reception (since our parents won't know of our first nikkah)? Is a double nikkah permissible to the same person? Your help is much appreciated.","Praise be to Allah.You will find a detailed answer to your first question under Question #2127. Know also that you can never have a proper marriage contract without your fathers knowledge and consent. Indeed, he or a person designated by him must marry you to the man who has asked for your hand. Once the marriage contract has been made according to Islamic law, meeting all the required conditions, then there is nothing wrong with having more than one waleemah (wedding reception) in more than one place. And Allaah is the source of help."
Ruling on showing humility to the boss at work,"Question I am a university student, and I want to earn halal wealth, so I can spend on myself and help my family with it as much as I can. The only obstacle to my finding a way of earning a living is my submissive and obsequious attitude towards many people, including my boss at work. My question is: isn’t showing submissiveness to anyone other than Allah a sin? Doesn’t that make wealth earned this way haram? How can I rid myself of this submissiveness and obsequiousness with the boss in particular and with people in general? I don’t mind if you advise me to read a book on this topic, as I love reading.","Praise be to Allah.The basic principle with regard to taking up jobs and occupations is that they are permissible, and nothing is a sin, unless there is clear evidence that it is prohibited. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: People’s words and actions are of two types: acts of worship, by means of which they have sound commitment to their religion, and regular daily activities that they need in their worldly affairs. By examining the basic principles of Islam, we realise that the acts of worship which Allah has enjoined or that He loves cannot be proven to be enjoined except on the basis of religious texts… Regular daily activities are permissible in principle, so none of them are to be prohibited except what Allah has prohibited, otherwise we will be included in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): {Say, “Have you seen what Allah has sent down to you of provision of which you have made [some] lawful and [some] unlawful?”} [Yunus 10:59]. Hence Allah condemned the polytheists who prescribed matters of religion for which Allah did not give permission, and they prohibited things that Allah did not prohibit… This is an important and beneficial principle.""(Majmu‘ al-Fatawa 29/16-18). What is causing you confusion as a result of feeling inferior and submissive is because this type of feeling usually occurs as a result of four things when people interact with one another. 1. Humility Humility is prescribed for Muslims in general, and is encouraged in Islamic teachings. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of Allah; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing} [al-Ma’idah 5:54]. Humility is a kind of mercy and being easy-going when interacting with others, and not looking down on them or being arrogant, as is explained in a different verse, in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves} [al-Fath 48:29]. It was narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of one who will be forbidden to the Fire, or one to whom the Fire will be forbidden: every approachable, gentle, easy-going person.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2488); he said: This is a hasan gharib hadith. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah (2/611). 2. Fear The worker’s fear of the boss that he may dismiss him from his job or deduct something from his salary is usually a kind of fear of people regarding that in which Allah has granted them power. This is not haram and is not a sin, but it is falling short in putting one’s trust in Allah (tawakkul) in the true meaning of the word. Please see the answer to question no. 191525 . 3. Shyness Shyness (haya’) in dealing with people is part of faith. It was narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) passed by a man of the Ansar who was exhorting his brother regarding shyness. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him be, for shyness is part of faith.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (24) and Muslim (36). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by “exhorting his brother regarding shyness” is that he was telling him not to be shy, and telling him that shyness was bad and rebuking him for being too shy. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him not to do that, and said: “Let him be, for shyness is part of faith” – in other words, let him be shy and stop telling him not to be like that.""(Sharh Sahih Muslim 2/6). 4. Obedience Obedience to your boss regarding what you committed yourself to do in the contract between you and him is something obligatory. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts} [al-Ma’idah 5:1]. With regard to obeying your boss when he asks you to do something that is in the interests of the work, but is not included in the contract, if it is minor and does not harm the worker, then doing that is recommended. It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah have mercy on a man who is easy-going when he sells, when he buys, and when he asks for payment.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (2076). Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is encouragement to be easy-going when dealing with people, and to be well mannered, with a sublime attitude, and not to be strict.""(Fath al-Bari 4/307). To sum up: if the Muslim interacts with his boss or with other people in these ways, he will be fine or will be rewarded. But that is subject to the condition that good manners and a good attitude when dealing with people does not lead to keeping quiet about or approving of haram actions, or helping others in doing them, or doing them oneself. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty} [al-Ma’idah 5:2]. There can be no humility, shyness or obedience when it comes to haram matters. It was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience if it involves disobedience [to Allah]; rather obedience is only in that which is right and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (7257) and Muslim (1840). It was also narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (2/318) as: “There is no obedience to any human if it involves disobedience to Allah.” Just being afraid of your boss at work is not an excuse for committing haram actions. Rather what you must do if you see haram actions being committed is to denounce them to the best of your ability and as much as will achieve the goal of removing them, in compliance with the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim (49). You should also be cautious and ensure that your good attitude in dealing with people does not lead to you allowing others to humiliate you, for it is not the way of the believer to put himself in a humiliating position. Ibrahim an-Nakha‘i said: They – meaning the early generations (salaf) – hated to be humiliated by others, but when they had the power to retaliate, they would forgive. Mentioned in a mu‘allaq report by al-Bukhari in as-Sahih. Fath al-Bari (5/99). Conclusion: if you are doing permissible work, and not helping in any sin or approving of it, and not putting yourself in a humiliating position, then there is nothing wrong with your work. Your feelings of being inferior or submissive to the boss may be intrusive thoughts from the Shaytan, aimed at discouraging you from doing that which is beneficial for you. The way to deal with that is to seek Allah’s help and focus on what you find beneficial in your permissible work. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless.” Narrated by Muslim (2664). If your issue has to do with extreme shyness, we advise you to read the book Fiqh al-Haya’ by Shaykh Muhammad Isma‘il al-Muqaddam. And Allah knows best."
Dealing With Homosexual Brother-In-Law,"Question I have a daughter who is three years old, and two sons, one of whom is nine and the other is two. These days I am having some problems with my husband because he suggested that he should bring his brother, who is homosexual and is fifty years old, to stay with us! I adamantly refused to agree to that. I do not want any homosexual man to enter my house. I am afraid that he will bring some punishment or wrath from Allah upon us. I also fear for my nine-year-old son lest he be influenced by this man in some way. My husband also wanted me to show respect to his brother and to speak kindly to him, and so on. How can he expect all this from me towards a man like that?! Do you have any advice? I hope that you can help me to resolve this problem.","Praise be to Allah. If it is proven that your brother’s husband is as you describe him and that he is a homosexual and does the action of the people of Loot, then it is not permissible – in this case – for your husband to admit him to his house, let alone allow him to meet his sons. It is also not permissible for him to ask you to show respect to him, because he is not one of those who are deserving of respect; rather he is one of those who are deserving of rebuke and shunning, and he deserves to be shown hostility because of what he is, not to be respected, because what he is doing is a grave evil, immorality, and act of disobedience. The major sin that he is doing – if it is proven – is one of the most horrid and repulsive of major sins. Hence those who do it are deserving of the greatest punishment such as landslides, stoning and drowning such as no nation of disbelievers were punished with before or since. Ibn al-Qayyim narrated – in Zaad al-Ma‘aad (5/40) – from his shaykh, Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), that the Sahaabah (companions of the Prophet) were unanimously agreed that the one who does the action of the people of Loot is to be executed; they only differed as to the manner of execution. Regarding the serious nature of the sin of homosexuality and the punishment for the one who does it, please see the answer to questions no. 38622, 2104 and 10050 Hence we agree with you in your stance about him entering your house, and we also agree with you about the kind of treatment that he deserves. So do not hesitate to prevent him from entering the house in the first place, let alone staying there. What your husband has to do is to take the decision himself; rather he should have taken a decision before you did, because Islam has given him the responsibility of taking care of his family, looking after them and advising them. His giving permission to his homosexual brother to enter his house and meet his sons, and asking his wife to show respect to him – all of that is contrary to the obligations that Allah has given him of protecting his family and taking care of them. It is a kind of haraam (unlawful) betrayal of his flock for whom Allah has made him responsible. But if it so happens that this homosexual has repented sincerely before he enters your house or stays there, and he shows you that he has truly repented and mended his ways, then in that case there is nothing wrong with him entering the house, provided that the wife does not appear before him or mix with him or spend time alone with him; these actions are basically forbidden even if the person is pious. He is still the “in-law” whom Islam warns about. We have explained in more than one answer the seriousness of this problem, how widespread it is and how people are heedless concerning it. So in the case of a person like this, it is essential to deal with him, even after his repentance, with the greatest caution and to block all ways that may lead to evil and temptation. See the answers to questions no. 7650, 129302, 13261 and 47764 Let your husband also read the answer to question no. 147901 in which there is discussion of what the brother’s responsibilities are towards his homosexual brother. And Allah knows best."
Is it permissible for him to live with his paternal uncle who has adolescent daughters?,"Question I am a young man, living with my paternal uncle who has 7 daughters. We live in one house, where we are separated by the walls. Is it permissible for me to live with them, as they have now reached the age of adolescence?.","Praise be to Allah. What we advise you to do is not to live with your uncle and his family, because you are not a mahram for your uncle’s wife or for his daughters, and this will cause you and them a great deal of restrictions if you live with them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade entering upon women, and when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about the husband’s relatives, he spoke more sternly about them than about anyone else. So listen to the hadeeth and read what the scholars have said about it. It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the in-law? He said: “The in-law is death.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of Arabic language are agreed that the word ahma’ (in-laws) refers to the relatives of a woman’s husband, such as his father, brother, nephew, cousin and so on. With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “the in-law is death”, what this means is that the fear with regard to him is greater than the fear with regard to others, and evil is expected from him and the fitnah is greater because he is able to reach the woman and be alone with her without being denounced for that, unlike one who is a stranger. What is meant by the in-law here is the relatives of the husband, apart from his father (and grandfather) or his sons. Fathers and sons are mahrams for his wife and it is permissible for them to be alone with her, and they are not described as being death. Rather what is meant here is the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and so on, who are not mahrams. The custom among people is to take this matter lightly, so a man may be alone with his brother’s wife. This is what is meant by death, and he should be prevented more than a stranger for the reasons we have mentioned. What I have mentioned is the correct meaning of the hadeeth. Ibn al-A’raabi said: This is a phrase that is used by the Arabs, as it is said: The lion is death, i.e., meeting a lion is like death. Al-Qaadi said: what is meant is being alone with the in-laws (the husband’s relatives) which may lead to fitnah and disaster for one's religious commitment, so it is likened to the disaster of death in order to demonstrate the seriousness of the matter. End quote. Sharh Muslim, 14/154 You can see that this hadeeth applies to your situation, if you enter upon your uncle’s wife or daughters who are non-mahrams for you, so what about the ruling if you live with them? Secondly: If you have no alternative but to live with them, or you are going to stay there temporarily until you find another house, then you must pay attention to the following matters: 1 – Avoid being alone with your uncle’s wife or one of his daughters. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a woman and she should not travel unless she is accompanied by a mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2844; Muslim, 1341. 2 – Both you and the women should lower the gaze and avoid looking at one another. Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do. 31. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyûbihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons…” [al-Noor 24:30-31] 3 – When you speak to them or they speak to you, there should be no softening of the voice or speaking in an alluring tone. Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner” [al-Ahzaab 33:32] 4 – Your uncle’s wife and daughters should observe proper hijab in front of you, covering the entire body. It is better for you not to live with them, and to look for a house of your own, so as to relieve them and you of any shar’i restrictions, and so that you will not be a cause of hardship and restrictions for them. If their house is big and you can have a separate room with all amenities, then it is permissible for you to live there, but as for living in a room in their house, and sharing the facilities of the house, we do not think that that is permissible, and we think that the conditions that we have mentioned for it to be permissible will be difficult for many people to meet. See also the answer to question no. 13261 for important information. And Allaah knows best."
Youngs Boys Playing With Genitals,"Question My son is four and a half years old. I have started to notice that he sometimes puts his hand into his underwear to move the underpants away from his body. When I told him off for putting his hand in this place he said that it hurts in this area, meaning that he had an erection. So I took off his underwear and left him in regular pants. Now he prefers to stay at home with no underpants. Was this a mistake? Can I let him get used to that?","Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your keenness to take care in raising your children, which is something that many people are careless about, even though there are commands in the Qur’aan and Sunnah which enjoin protecting oneself and one’s family from the Fire, being sincere towards them, taking care of them and paying attention to their spiritual affairs such as prayer, and making them sleep in separate beds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded.” [al-Tahreem 66:6] It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler of the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for her flock. The slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829). It was narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yasaar said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is no one whom Allaah puts in charge of a group of people then he fails to take care of them, but he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6731). Your noticing your son’s movements is indicative of your concern to make him get used to good attributes and avoid bad attributes. This is a good thing, but at the age which you say your son is – four years old – sexual urges have not appeared in the majority of children. Some research has shown that it is possible for sexual urges to appear in some children before puberty, which is manifested in playing with the genitals for the purpose of sexual enjoyment. Some educators believe that this habit begins at the age of nine in ten percent of children, and others think that it may start between the ages of two and six. [See: ‘Adnaan Saalih Bahaarith: Mas’ooliyat al-Abb al-Muslim fi Tarbiyat al-Walad fi Marhalat al-Tufoolah, p. 468] A father often sees a child of this age putting his hand on his genitals without noticing, and if he is told, he will pay attention and remove his hand. The reason for that in some cases may be because there is an itch or an infection in that place, because the mother has been overzealous in cleaning him, or the cause of the infection may be negligence in cleaning the child after urinating or defecating. Another reason why a child may be interested in his private part is that he has been given the opportunity to play with it by being left naked for lengthy periods, so he starts to look at it and play with it. What should be done is to make the child get used to being covered from a young age, and put him off the idea of remaining naked. If the child is seen placing his hand on his private part, he should be distracted with something else, such as giving him a toy or a cookie, or by hugging him and kissing him. The aim is to distract him from this habit by simple means without making a fuss. There is no need to scold him harshly, because that will only make him more curious about that area and find out why he isn’t allowed to play with it. There is nothing wrong with asking the child if he has an itch or a pain in that area which is making him play with himself. Op.cit., p. 472 With regard to your son’s issue in particular, we think that you should make sure that there is no problem in his clothes or body that is making him do that. Try to dress him in loose underwear and do not leave him wearing his outer pants only. Whatever the case: We advise fathers and mothers that it is essential to make their children get used to being covered and modest, and not let them wear short clothes, whether they are male or female. They should get used to wearing concealing clothes when they are still small, so that they will grow up chaste and decent. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is well known that if a person is influenced by something when he is small, he will remain influenced by it when he grows up. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined us to tell our children to pray when they are seven years old and to smack them (lightly)if they do not pray when they are ten, so that they will get used to it, and the child will follow what he has gotten used to.

"She was financially and physically able but she did not do Hajj because she had no mahram, then she died. Is it obligatory to do Hajj on her behalf?","Question My mother died four years ago. Before she died, she had plenty of gold and wealth, and she used to say in our hearing that she wanted to sell the gold and go for Hajj, but my father kept delaying it and he did not have the intention of going for Hajj, even though he was well off and physically able. After my mother died, we – her sons – took the gold and said: we will perform Hajj on her behalf, in sha Allah. Was it obligatory for my mother to go for Hajj? Can we appoint students who are studying in Saudi to do Hajj on her behalf in return for a sum of money? We, her sons, are not able to do Hajj on her behalf at the present time, and we do not want to keep the gold any longer.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: If a person meets the conditions of Hajj being obligatory, then does not go for Hajj before he or she dies, then money must be set aside from the estate for Hajj to be performed on his or her behalf. The conditions of Hajj being obligatory are being financially and physically able for it, in addition to having a mahram in the case of women. If your mother was financially and physically able to do Hajj but she could not find a mahram to go for Hajj with her, then Hajj was not obligatory for her, and you may divide the gold amongst yourselves. But what is recommended is for one of you to do Hajj on her behalf, or you should appoint someone to do Hajj on her behalf. If she had the opportunity to go for Hajj with one of her mahrams but did not take this opportunity, and she had enough money to sponsor herself and her mahram, then Hajj remains an obligation that she owes, and it should be done on her behalf with her wealth. It says in Mataalib Ooli an-Nuha (2/291): One of the conditions of Hajj or ‘umrah becoming obligatory for a woman is having a mahram, whether she is young or old. This was stated by Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him). He said: The mahram is essential (for Hajj to be obligatory). If a woman does not have a mahram then Hajj is not obligatory in her case, whether she does it herself or it is done on her behalf by a proxy. That is because of the marfoo‘ hadith of Ibn ‘Abbaas: “No woman should travel except with a mahram, and no man should enter upon her unless she has a mahram with her.” A man said: O Messenger of Allah, I want to go out with such and such an army, and my wife wants to go for Hajj. He said: “Go with her.” Narrated by Ahmad with a saheeh isnad. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah in a marfoo‘ report: “It is not permissible for any woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel the distance of one day and one night without a mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. And the expenses of the mahram, whilst he is travelling with her so that she can do Hajj, even if the mahram is her husband, are to be borne by the man, as would be the case of they were not travelling; anything more than that is to be borne by the woman, because he is coming for her sake. In order for Hajj to be obligatory for the woman, she must possess food supplies and a means of transportation for herself and her mahram… If she does not possess such things for herself and her mahram, then Hajj is not obligatory in her case. And it is not obligatory for the mahram, even if she is willing to provide food and transportation for him, and whatever else he needs, to travel with her, because of the hardship involved. That is like the case of Hajj on behalf of someone who is old and unable to do it. If her mahram refuses to travel with her, then she is like one who has no mahram, and Hajj is not obligatory in her case. End quote. Secondly: There is nothing wrong with you appointing someone who is studying in Makkah to do Hajj on behalf of your mother, on condition that he has already done Hajj on his own behalf. For information and guidelines on appointing someone to do Hajj on behalf of someone else, please see the answers to questions no. 111794 and 111407. However, many of the fuqaha’ have stipulated that the proxy should set out for Hajj from the place from which the one who appointed him would have set out, or from his miqaat. See: al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (42/46). But some of the scholars took a more easy-going approach to the matter, and regarded it as permissible to do Hajj on someone else’s behalf, even if the proxy sets out from Makkah. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Qawl az-Zaad: “From the place where Hajj became obligatory” means from the place from which it became obligatory for the person on whose behalf he is doing Hajj to set out for Hajj. For example, if he lived in Madinah and Hajj became obligatory for him whilst he was in Madinah, then it is essential that the proxy who is doing Hajj on his behalf should also reside in Madinah, and if he were to appoint a proxy from Rabigh or from the miqaat, that is not acceptable. If he appoints a proxy from Makkah, it is even more likely to be unacceptable. So he must appoint someone from the place in which Hajj became obligatory for him. The reason is that if this man wanted to do Hajj on his own behalf, he would set out for Hajj from his home in Madinah, so the proxy who does it on his behalf must do likewise. But this is a weak view, because the one who appoints a proxy would have to set out from his own city, because he cannot take a single step or reach Makkah unless he sets out from his own city. Hence if the one who appoints a proxy in Makkah travelled there for some purpose other than Hajj – either to study or for some other purpose – then he decided to enter ihram for the obligatory Hajj from Makkah, do we regard that as being permissible for him, or do we say: go to Madinah, because you are one of the people of Madinah, and it is obligatory for you to do Hajj from Madinah? We say: There is nothing wrong with him entering ihram for Hajj from Makkah. Therefore there is nothing wrong with the proxy entering ihram from Makkah, because travelling from Madinah to Makkah is not something that is sought in and of itself; rather it is something required for some other purpose, because it is not possible for one who lives in Madinah to do Hajj except by setting out from Madinah. The correct view is that he does not have to appoint a proxy to do Hajj on his behalf from the place where he is; rather he can appoint a proxy to do Hajj on his behalf from Makkah, and there is nothing wrong with that, because travelling to Makkah is not something that is sought for its own sake. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (7/33). The Permanent Committee for Ifta’ was asked about an African man who wants to appoint someone to do Hajj on behalf of his mother. They replied: It is permissible for the person mentioned to appoint a trustworthy person from Makkah or from elsewhere to do Hajj on behalf of his mother, if she is deceased or she is unable to do Hajj for herself because of old age or sickness from which there is no hope of recovery. And Allah is the source of strength; may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote.

"She did tawaf for ‘umrah, then she went to Madinah, and did sa‘i after she returned","Question A woman entered ihram with the intention of doing ‘umrah. She circumambulated the Ka‘bah (tawaf) and prayed behind Maqaam Ibraaheem, then she went with her group to visit al-Madinah al-Munawwarah, and came back on the same day and did sa‘i. Is her ‘umrah valid, or does she have to do something?","Praise be to Allah.It is not stipulated that sa‘i should be done straight after tawaf, according to the view of the majority of fuqaha’. So if someone does tawaf then delays sa‘i for a day or more, his sa‘i is valid. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (10/240): It is not essential that sa‘i should be done straight after tawaf. Imam Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with delaying sa‘i in order to rest, or until afternoon. ‘Ata’ and al-Hasan did not see anything wrong with someone circumambulating the Ka‘bah at the beginning of the day and delaying [sa‘i between] as-Safa and al-Marwah until afternoon. Al-Qaasim and Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr did that. End quote. See: al-Majmoo‘ (8/99); al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (25/18); and the answer to question no. 109320 .

Does Touching Impure Things Break Wudu?,"Question If a mother cleans her baby and touches something impure (najasah), is her wudu invalidated thereby?","Praise be to Allah.The things that invalidate wudu are well known, and are mentioned in the answer to question no. 14321 . Touching something impure is not one of them. But if a person touches something impure, it is not permissible for him to pray until he has washed it off. Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is your opinion concerning a doctor whose work sometimes involves looking at the `awrah of the patient and touching it for the purpose of medical examination? Sometimes when doing surgery the doctor has to work in an environment that is filled with blood and urine. Is it obligatory to renew wudu in this situation or is it better to do so? He replied: “There is no sin in the (male) doctor touching a man’s `awrah in cases of necessity or touching it for the purpose of treatment , whether that is the `awrah at the front or the back. He may look at it or touch it in cases of necessity. Also it does not matter if he touches blood if he needs to during surgery, whether to remove it or to check on the state of the wound. But he should wash his hands afterwards to remove whatever has gotten onto them. Touching blood or urine does not invalidate wudu, but if he touches the awrah, whether at the front or the back, his wudu does become invalidated. But touching blood , urine or other impure substances does not invalidate wudu, rather he has to wash them off.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Baz, 6/20) For more, please see these answers: 111812 , 976 , 163825 , and 136524 . And Allah knows best."
He sneezed whilst he was praying – should he say al-hamdu Lillaah?,"Question If I sneeze whilst I am praying, should I say al-hamdu Lillaah or not?.","Praise be to Allah. If a person sneezes whilst he is praying, it is prescribed for him to say al-hamdu Lillaah, may He be glorified, whether the prayer is obligatory or naafil. This is the view of the majority of scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, and it was also the view of Imam Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad, but they differed as to whether he should say it silently or out loud. The correct view and the view of Imam Ahmad is that he should say it out loud, but only loud enough that he can hear himself, lest he distract other worshippers. That is indicated by the general meaning of the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If one of you sneezes, let him say ‘Al-hamdu Lillaah’…” The hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari. That is also supported by the report narrated by Rifaa’ah ibn Raafi’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I prayed behind the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and I sneezed and said: Praise be to Allaah, much good and blessed praise, as our Lord loves and is pleased with. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had finished praying he said: “Who is the one who spoke during the prayer?” and no one said anything. Then he said it a second time, “Who is the one who spoke during the prayer?” and no one said anything. Then he said it a third time, “Who is the one who spoke during the prayer?” and Rifaa’ah ibn Raafi’ said: It was me, O Messenger of Allaah. He said: “What did you say?” He said: I said: Praise be to Allaah, much good and blessed praise, as our Lord loves and is pleased with. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, thirty-odd angels competed to see which of them would take it up.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa’i. Al-Tirmidhi said: a hasan hadeeth. Al-Haafiz narrated in al-Tahdheeb from al-Tirmidhi that it is saheeh. It was also narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh but he did not mention that he said that after sneezing, rather he said it after rising from bowing. It may be that he sneezed whilst rising from bowing and he said that because he sneezed, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of that and did not rebuke him for it. This indicates that it is prescribed during prayer, but if a person sneezes whilst praying then praises Allaah, it is not permissible for those who hear him to say Yarhamak Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you), because that is part of human speech and it is not permissible during prayer. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) denounced someone who said Yarhamak Allaah to a man who sneezed whilst praying, then he said to him: “In this prayer nothing of human speech is permitted; it is only tasbeeh (glorifying Allaah), takbeer (magnifying Allaah) and recitation of Qur’aan.” Narrated by Imam Muslim, Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa’i.

She used to pray but she was not aware of the obligation of ghusl after menses,"Question We would like you to tell us the ruling on a girl who reached the age of puberty but was not aware that it is obligatory to do ghusl after menses in order to be able to pray. She used to pray without realising that it was obligatory to do ghusl, until after that she found out about that ruling. What is the ruling on her past prayers, and does she have to make up those prayers now, after learning about ghusl?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The Muslim is obliged to learn those rulings of sharee‘ah that he needs to know and cannot do without, such as the rulings on purification, prayer and so on, and before all of that he needs to know about the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed), even if that is in general terms, and to know that which nullifies Tawheed and faith, so that he will worship Allah, may He be exalted, on the basis of knowledge. Fathers and mothers must teach their children what they need to know of Islamic rulings, including the purification and prayer. This is one of the rights that children have over their parents. Secondly: If a person is unaware of the rulings on purification, and he prays with invalid purification out of ignorance on his part, then there is no sin on him and he does not have to make up those prayers that he offered with imperfect purification. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Based on that, if a person does not purify himself as he is obliged to because the text did not reach him, such as if he eats camel meat and does not do wudoo’ after that, then the text reaches him and it becomes clear to him that wudoo’ is required in this case, or he prays in the camel pens, then the text reaches him and the ruling becomes clear to him, does he have to repeat his past prayers? There are two scholarly opinions, both of which were narrated from Ahmad. A similar case is if he touches his penis then prays, then it becomes clear to him that it is obligatory to do wudoo’ after touching one’s penis. The correct view in all these cases is that he does not have to repeat the prayers, because Allah pardons things done by mistake or because of forgetting, and because He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)” [al-Isra’ 17:15]. If the command of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) concerning a particular matter did not reach a person, then the ruling that it is obligatory was not proven in his case. Hence in the case of ‘Umar and ‘Ammaar, when they became junub and ‘Umar did not pray whilst ‘Ammaar did pray after rolling in the dust, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not instruct either of them to repeat the prayer. Similarly, he did not instruct Abu Dharr to repeat the prayer when he used to become junub and remained for several days without praying. And he did not instruct the Companion who ate until he could clearly distinguish the white thread from the black thread to make up the fast. And he did not instruct those who prayed facing towards Jerusalem before news reached them that this ruling (of facing Jerusalem when praying) had been abrogated to make up those prayers. A similar case is that of the woman who was suffering from istihaadah (irregular, non-menstrual bleeding) and did not pray for a while because she thought that prayer was not obligatory in her case. There are two scholarly views as to whether she is obliged to make up the prayers. The first view is that she is not required to do so – as was narrated from Maalik and others – because when the woman who was suffering from istihaadah said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): I bleed very heavily and that has kept me from praying and fasting, he told her what she had to do in the future, but he did not instruct her to make up prayers from the past. It is proven to me through the mutawaatir reports that among women and men in the desert and elsewhere there are those who reach the age of puberty and are not aware that prayer is obligatory for them. In fact, if a woman is told to pray, she says, Not until I am older and become an old woman! – thinking that prayer is only obligatory for old women and the like. Among the followers of the shaykhs (i.e., Sufis) there are many groups who do not know that prayer is obligatory for them. In these cases they are not required to make up the missed prayers, according to the correct opinion. End quote.

"There are some problems between his mother and his wife, and his mother wants him to live far away from her","Question The relationship between my mother and my wife is very bad, to the extent that my mother does not want to see my wife’s face, and she wants us to live on our own, but I am not ready to leave my mother because I am the oldest son in the family. At the same time I do not want to make her angry. Should I divorce my wife?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: There is no doubt that the mother has the greatest rights of all people over her son, and that honouring her is one of the most important duties. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour” [al-Isra’ 17:23]. Allah has enjoined kind treatment of others too, whom the individual is enjoined to treat kindly, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masaakeen (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allaah does not like such as are proud and boastful”[al-Nisa’ 4:36] and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has enjoined giving everyone who has rights their due [See: Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 1968]. Hence the rights of the parents, especially the mother, take precedence over the rights of all people. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: Which of the people is most deserving of my good companionship? He said: “Your mother.” He said: Then who? He said: “Then your mother.” He said: Then who? He said: “Then your mother.” He said: Then who? He said: “Then your father.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5971) and Muslim (2548). But this does not mean that a person should not give other people their rights; rather he has to give everyone who has rights his due, as stated above, and he has to strike a balance between these rights and fulfil his duties to the people around him as best he can and know how to run his home and his affairs well. Secondly: These problems between the wife and the mother are a common and ancient problem. The wise man who is guided is the one who looks at his situation positively and reduces problems as much as he can and closes the door to them. For this reason one of the rights that the wife has over her husband is that he should provide her with separate accommodation. It says in al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah (25/109): Putting the parents and the wife together in one home is not permissible (and the same applies to other relatives). Hence the wife has the right to refuse to live with either of them, because it is her right to have separate accommodation where she feels safe with regard to herself and her property. No one has the right to force her to do that. This is the view of the majority of Hanafi, Shaafa‘i and Hanbali fuqaha’. The Maalikis are of the view that a distinction should be made between the wife of noble birth and the wife of lowly birth, and they say that it is not permissible to make the wife of noble birth and the parents live together in the same house, but doing that is permissible with a wife of lowly birth, unless making the wife of lowly birth and the parents live together will cause her some harm. End quote. Undoubtedly the picture that you have painted of the relationship between your mother and your wife dictates that their living together in one house is not possible and that separating them is obligatory, especially since the mother is the one who has asked for that. So you must hasten to do that and it is not wise to think of the other solution, which is divorcing your wife. This is not a solution to the problem, especially if you have any children from her. Moreover the problem may arise again with any other wife whom you bring to live with your mother in the same house. So what you should do is hasten to do this as soon as you can, which is looking for a separate house for you and your wife. If you want to be close to your mother, so that you can be in constant touch with her and take care of her, then try to find your new house as close as possible to your mother's house, so that you can pop in to see her every time you come or go. In this way you can treat your mother kindly, relieve her of the burden of problems with your wife and keep in constant touch with her, whilst at the same time doing what you are obliged to do for your wife of treating her kindly and giving her accommodation that is suited for her.

Praying istikhaarah in all one’s affairs,"Question We often hear about Salaat al-Istikhaarah, but we only do it in rare cases. Is this correct? I hope you can explain to us.","Praise be to Allah.Salaat al-Istikhaarah is a means of achieving true submission [‘uboodiyyah] to Allah and focusing the Muslim’s heart on Allah, and freeing him from feeling attached to other created beings. Striving to achieve that in all vicissitudes of the heart and soul is the utmost submission, the perfection of putting one’s trust in Allah. That is when the person feels his need of Allah and finds joy and tranquillity in turning to the Creator, the Almighty, the Controller of affairs, so hardly anything happens to him, great or small, but he turns to Salaat al-Istikhaarah to seek guidance from Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his companions to pray istikhaarah in all things, just as he used to teach them soorahs from the Qur’aan Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6382). Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (11/184): The general meaning includes both major matters and insignificant ones. Perhaps an insignificant matter may result in something major. End quote. Al-‘Ayni said in ‘Umdat al-Qaari (7/223): The words “in all things” are indicative of its general meaning, and that a man should not regard anything as too insignificant because it is small and not pay attention to it, and thus not pray istikhaarah or pray for guidance concerning it. He may regard something as insignificant but doing it or not doing it may lead to great harm. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let one of you ask his Lord even with regard to his shoelace.” End quote. Thus it is clear that it is a mistake to limit istikhaarah to rare cases or few issues. Rather the Muslim should turn to Allah and seek His guidance in all his affairs concerning which he is hesitant. Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) prayed istikhaarah when she received a proposal of marriage from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) commented on that by saying in Sharh Muslim (9/224): This shows that it is mustahabb to pray istikhaarah for the one who is thinking about doing something, whether the matter is evidently good or not. This is in accordance with the hadeeth of Jaabir in Saheeh al-Bukhaari: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach us to pray istikhaarah in all things.” And perhaps she prayed istikhaarah because she was afraid that she might fall short with regard to his rights (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). End quote. It says in Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (no. 85/question 1): Question: Are the two rak’ahs of istikhaarah prescribed only with regard to matters where it is not obvious which is the right option, or should they be done concerning every matter one does, even if it is obviously good, such as becoming the imam of a mosque or proposing marriage to a righteous woman and the like? I hope you can clarify? Answer: Salaat al-istikhaarah is done when a person is thinking of something and is hesitant about the consequences, so he prays istikhaarah to Allah, i.e., he asks Allah for the better of the two options: going ahead with it or not doing it. But he should not pray istikhaarah with regard to everything, meaning that if a person wants to eat lunch he should say, I will pray istikhaarah about it, or if he wants to go and pray with the congregation in the mosque he should say, I will pray istikhaarah about it. Rather he should pray istikhaarah and ask Allah for guidance about things of which he does not know the consequences, such as becoming the imam of a mosque, if he is offered a position as imam of a mosque and does not know whether it is better for him to become imam or not. So he should pray istikhaarah, because being the imam is good in and of itself, but with regard to the consequences, he does not know whether he will be able to fulfil the duties of being imam or not, or whether he will be able to settle in this mosque or not, or whether he will be suitable for this congregation or not, so he is not asking for guidance about becoming an imam with regard to whether it is good; rather he is praying for guidance as to whether it is better in terms of consequences. How often does a man become imam of a mosque then he gets tired and does not do his duty, and problems with the congregation make him wish that he had not become imam. The same applies to marrying a righteous woman; he does not know what the consequences will be. What matters is that in all cases where you are hesitant or uncertain, you must turn to Allah and ask Him for the better of the two options. End quote.

Learning from trustworthy scholars,"Question I am a seeker of knowledge; I love to learn and I strive hard in the pursuit of knowledge. I am studying with one of the scholars (i.e., a Sayyid), leaning fiqh, nahw (grammar) and tajweed. Some of the brothers told me that these people slander some of the Sahaabah, and in fact I have found that this is true in some cases, but I am still studying with them. I hope that you can tell me which is best – should I complete my studies, or look for other scholars? I also wrote to the land of Persia, and they sent me some religious books and other material, but they are Imaamiyyah, i.e., they exaggerate too much about the Ahl al-Bayt (members of the Prophet’s household). Do you advice me to complete my studies with them? I read the Qur’aan a great deal in Ramadaan, but I found that I make mistakes in my reading. I went to one of the scholars and asked him to teach me, but I discovered that he makes mistakes, and I do not know what to do. In my area there is no haafiz, and during Ramadaan I stay in my village. Is it permissible for me to buy tapes of Qur’aan? or should I look for a scholar who can teach me Qur’aan?","Praise be to Allah.You have to study with scholars who are known for their knowledge and whose ‘aqeedah is sound, and keep away from these innovators who go against the Ahl al-Sunnah. These include the Shee’ah and Imaamiyyah. Do not study with them or sit with them or correspond with them or read their books, lest they lead you astray from the path of Allaah. Study Qur’aan with someone who reads it well and whose ‘aqeedah and religious commitment are sound. There is no reason why you should not listen to tapes of Qur’aan in order to benefit from them."
Can a menstruating woman fast?,"Question When a woman gets her period can she stop fasting during Ramadaan, and fast other days in place of the days when she did not fast?","Praise be to Allah.The fast of a menstruating woman is not valid, and it is not permissible for her to fast. When she has her period she should stop fasting, and after her period is over she can fast other days in place of the days that she missed."
"A Christian woman wants to stipulate that if they become Muslim, her husband should not take a second wife","Question There is a Christian woman who is married and has three children. She is close to entering Islam – by Allah’s leave – but her husband is also Christian, and she is afraid that if her husband becomes Muslim, he will take a second wife. Can she stipulate in the marriage contract that her husband should not take a second wife? Please note that at present they are not Muslim, but after they become Muslim – by Allah’s leave – is it valid for them to write this condition in the marriage contract?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Stipulating that the husband should not take a second wife is one of the conditions that it is permissible for a wife to stipulate, according to the madhhab of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him). It was also narrated from some of the Sahaabah and Taabi‘een, and was the view favoured by a number of senior scholars. The permissibility thereof has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 108806. Secondly: If a couple become Muslim around the same time, and there is no lengthy interval in between, or if the husband becomes Muslim before the wife’s ‘iddah following her becoming Muslim ends, then their previous marriage contract remains valid. In this case, it is not valid for her to stipulate that her husband should not take a second wife, because the conditions that are valid in contracts are those that are stipulated when the contract is first drawn up, or they are agreed upon before marriage. If the wife becomes Muslim before her husband, and her husband delays becoming Muslim until her ‘iddah has ended, then in this case their marriage is annulled. Then if her husband becomes Muslim after that, it is essential to draw up a new marriage contract between them, according to the majority of scholars, in order for it to be permissible for her to go back to him. In this case – that is, if they want to do a new marriage contract, there is nothing wrong with her stipulating whatever conditions she wants to, to be included in the new marriage contract. And there is nothing wrong with her stipulating that he should not take a second wife. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If one of the spouses becomes Muslim, and the other delays becoming Muslim until the woman’s ‘iddah has ended, then the marriage is annulled, according to most of the scholars. End quote from al-Mughni (7/154). We have previously discussed this issue and explained that the more correct view is that after the ‘iddah has ended, the woman has the choice: she may either wait for her husband to become Muslim, and if he becomes Muslim, then she may go back to him on the basis of the first marriage contract, or she may marry someone else if she wishes. See the answer to question no. 21690. Thirdly: With regard to conditions added to the contract after it has been concluded, they are not binding upon either party. Al-Mirdaawi al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The time for mentioning conditions with regard to marriage is at the time of drawing up the contract. This was stated by al-Muharrir and others. Shaykh Taqiy ad-Deen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The same applies if they agreed on the condition before the contract was drawn up, according to the prevalent view of the madhhab. I say: This is the correct view, concerning which there can be no doubt. If the condition is stipulated after the contract has been drawn up and become binding, then the view that was narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) is that (this condition) is not binding. End quote from al-Insaaf (8/154). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to marriage contracts, it is not possible to add retroactive conditions. With regard to sales contracts, it is possible to add conditions after the contract has been drawn up, such as conditions added before the two parties to the deal separate or if the option to add this condition is mentioned in the contract. End quote from ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustaqni‘ (12/163). Fourthly: What this woman should do is hasten to enter Islam, and not let the issue of her husband taking a second wife prevent her or her husband from becoming Muslim, because that comes under the heading of the Shaytaan trying to scare her and discourage her from becoming Muslim. So she should try to annoy the Shaytaan and pay no heed to his attempts to scare her or the negative thoughts that he casts into her heart to try to stop her and her husband becoming Muslim. Rather she should think positively of Allah, may He be exalted, and realise that He will never forsake her if she becomes Muslim. Rather the more a person turns to Allah, the more Allah will turn to him, love him, honour him and make his affairs easy for him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out And will provide for him from where he does not expect” [at-Talaaq 65:2-3]. We ask Allah, may He be exalted, to guide her and her husband. And Allah knows best."
Buying and selling shares through the bank,Question He buys shares in companies that deal in permissible things with his own money through the bank. He uses the bank’s facilities and the bank takes a set fee for every share that this man buys or sells – this is in return for using the bank as a middleman and using the bank’s facilities. What is the ruling?,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows: It is permissible to pay that as a fee."
How to make up for disobedience towards parents after they have died,"Question If a person was disobedient towards his parents, and they died angry with him, how can he put things right so that they will not ask him to put it right in the Hereafter?","Praise be to Allah.There is no way to stop them asking him to put things right in the Hereafter, but now that he has felt regret for what he did, he should make lots of du;aa; for them and ask Allaah to forgive them, give charity on their behalf if he can, honour the friends etc, whom they loved, uphold their ties of kinship, pay off their debts and do whatever else he can."
Ruling on burying the dead in a large underground chamber in which they are placed next to one another,"Question Is it permissible to bury the dead other than in graves? For example, digging a large underground chamber which can hold a number of dead, in which stones are placed like shelves and the dead are placed on them, and when this chamber is full it is closed up with a large rock.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: There is nothing wrong with burying more than one deceased person in one grave, when there is a need to do so, although that is contrary to the basic principle that each person should be buried in a separate grave. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah: The basic principle in Islam is that each deceased person should be buried in a separate grave if possible, and no one else should be buried with him, whether that is someone who died at the same time as him or someone who died after him. Similarly, the basic principle is that it is not permissible to disinter the dead after a while, remove them from their graves and put them in a single hole. But if it is not possible (to bury each person in a separate grave) because of lack of space, and there is no other space available, or it will cause a great deal of hardship to bury each person on his own, because there are so many dead people due to epidemic, mass killing and so on, it is permissible to bury more than one dead person in a single grave. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, 7/285 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What is prescribed is to bury each person in a grave on his own, as has always been the custom of the Muslims in the past and at present. But if there is a need to put two or more people together in one grave, there is nothing wrong with that, because after the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (sa) buried two or three men in each grave. In this case, the closest to the qiblah should be the one who knew most Qur’an, because he is the best, and they should be placed next to one another. The fuqaha’ said. A barrier of soil should be placed between each two. End quote from Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-‘Uthaymeen, 17/213 See also the answer to question no. 96667 Secondly: The Sunnah with regard to graves is to dig a hole in the ground for the deceased, then make a niche (lahd) inside it, by digging a trench in the side of the grave nearest to the qiblah, then to place the deceased in it. Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 9/2 The scholars of the committee said: With regard to the burial, a rectangular hole should be dug in the ground, according to the size of the deceased who is to be buried, then a niche should be made at the bottom of the grave on the side nearest to the qiblah, in which the deceased is placed with his face towards the qiblah, lying on his right side. Then the bricks should be placed level over him, and the spaces between the bricks should be filled with mud to prevent dirt getting on him, then the grave should be filled in with soil. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah, 8/384 Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: In our country structures of stone and marble are built over graves, and burial chambers are built in the form of rooms beneath the ground in which the dead are placed. Is this permissible? He replied: With regard to building over graves and erecting structures over them and plastering them, this is an evil act and is not permissible. With regard to digging a hole in the ground and placing a number of dead in it, this is contrary to the Sunnah. The Sunnah is for each deceased person to be placed in a grave on his own. A niche should be made for him and he should be placed in his grave on his own. This is the Sunnah; it is what the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to do in Madinah, and it is what the Muslims do. But if there is a need because there are large numbers of deceased and it is too difficult to place each one in a grave on his own, then there is nothing to prevent putting two or three together in one grave. End quote from Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb, 14/96 To sum up the above: Making a chamber beneath the ground and burying the deceased in it in the manner mentioned is an act that is not prescribed. What is prescribed is to bury each deceased person on his own in the manner prescribed in Islam, then to level his grave over him, and not to bury more than one person in a single grave except in cases of need and the necessity. Further removed than that from the Sunnah and what is prescribed in Islam is: placing the dead on stones one above another in the form of shelves. And Allah knows best."
Convert attending his brother’s wedding party,"Question , I am a convert to Islam. My family are still, however, christian. My brother is getting married and this involves a religious service in a church followed by a meal. I have told my family that I cannot partake in the religious service. I wish to know if Islam allows me to attend the meal with my wife and child, where some alcohol may be served to some christians with the meal. If it is not allowed then what advice can you give me. Please give the answer with evidence. The issue is of great importance since I have been estranged from my father (by his choice) for 7 years and I am trying to invite them to Islam. Jazakallah khayran","Praise be to Allah.1. We praise Allaah for having guided you to Islam and we ask Him to complete His favour by helping you to be steadfast and by guiding your family to Islam. You are doing the right thing by not attending the religious service in the church, because taking part in religious proceedings of non-Muslims is, at the very least, a major sin, and could lead to kufr. With regard to attending your brother’s wedding party where alcohol will be served with the food, we advise you not to take part as you say. Attending such parties is haraam and is a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… then after the remembrance sit not in the company of those people who are the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)” [al-An’aam 6:68]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by feeling that it is wrong] – and that is the weakest of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim, 49). When you take part in such events, you will not be able to change the evil actions with your hand or your tongue – in most cases – so all you can do is change it with your heart, and you cannot be really doing so if you are taking part. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is being drunk.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 14241, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel, 7/6). The reason why it is forbidden – as it appears – is that sitting with them implies that you condone the evil action. 4. Apart from the fact that these things are forbidden, if the brother makes these compromises, this will weaken his efforts to call his family to Islam. The more sincere the daa’iyah is towards himself and to His Lord, the stronger his efforts to call others will be. But if he compromises and vacillates, this will make him look less trustworthy in the eyes of others. And Allaah knows best."
Prohibition of Lying,"Question My mother is still alive and is over one hundred years old. She is in a difficult situation because she cannot understand things, and she asks whether it is evening when it is morning, and she repeats words more than five times. She cannot move from where she is, and if she has been sleeping she is not able to sit up, etc. Her children answer all her questions, but their answers may be lies, such as when she asks them in the evening whether it is the morning, and they tell her yes, even though it is the evening, and so on. My question is: if they tell her lies, are they sinning or not? The second question is: is there any kafarah (expiation) which they should pay to make up for her fasts and prayers, or not? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allah. You should not tell her lies; you should tell her the truth, because telling her lies does not serve any purpose or benefit her in any way, or make her happy. With regard to prayer and fasting, there is no kafarah to be paid, and there is no sin on her, because she has become like a child. So long as she cannot tell what is what, and her feelings and mind have changed, she is not obliged to pray or fast, because she is not held accountable for that. She is now like a little child who is free of responsibility and there is no sin involved, in sha Allah. And Allah knows best."
Lending money to a poor person with the intention of getting it back from the people who pay zakah,"Question The people who acquired the house by inheritance are trying to evict the family who are renting it by all means and with no fear of Allah's wrath. They revile them and slander them in the nastiest of terms whilst people are listening, and they beat them. The police intervene all the time, and then the courts. The family are suffering and going through hardship of humiliation and poverty. This family that is suffering has a place, namely a store under a building but at the moment it is not fit to live in at all. They want to alter it and live in it. My question is: is it permissible for me to lend money to the family so that they can fix up the store as a clean place to live in, which will cost approximately 25,000 riyals, then get my money back from zakah or charity money? In other words, can I help them financially with the intention of recovering the debt myself from the money of charity or zakah from my family and acquaintances? Please advise me concerning this issue, may Allah bless you.","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for you to lend this family what they need of money to renovate their home, then take that from zakah because you are lending it to them and they will be in debt, and it is well known that the debtor is among the groups of people who are entitled to zakah, and it is not essential that the zakah be given to them, rather it is permissible to give the money to the lender directly. This applies if it is clearly and unambiguously identified as a loan. The same applies if you give the money to them for the purpose of reconciliation and so as to stop the dispute, and you intend to get it back from those who give zakah. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) preferred a third way, which is that it is permissible to give the money to the one who is entitled to it -- even if there is no dispute -- with the intention of giving zakah on behalf of a rich person. If the rich person agrees to that and allows it, then it will be counted as part of his zakah. These three ways are all permissible in your case: giving an unambiguous loan, giving it to them so as to reconcile between people with the intention of getting it back from those who give zakah, and giving them the zakah of so-and-so, someone who you know has money to give as zakah, then telling him about it and asking his consent. It says in Khashshaaf al-Qinaa’ (2/283): if a person who has zakah gives it to the lender to pay the debt of the debtor without the permission of the poor person who is in debt, it is sound and valid, because he has given zakah to pay off the debts of the debtor. This is similar to giving it to him to pay off his debts with it. End quote. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Allah have mercy on him) said: Reconciling between people -- if there is enmity and trouble between one group and another, then another person comes and reconciles between them, but reconciliation may not be possible except by giving money, so he says: I make a commitment to give each one of you 10,000 riyals provided that you reconcile, and they agree to that. So this man may be given zakah in the amount that he would have spent on reconciliation, so he may be given 20,000. But if the poor person pays it off himself from his own money, then he should not be given zakah, because if he pays it off from his own money then he is not a debtor and is not in debt now. But this matter is subject to further discussion and it may be said that he can be given zakah in two cases: 1.If he did not pay off the debt from his own money. In this case he is still in debt and it is essential to relieve him. 2.If he paid it off from his own money with the intention of getting it back from those who pay zakah, so as not to close the door to reconciliation. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “There is no good in most of their secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allah’s Cause), or Ma‘roof (Islamic Monotheism and all the good and righteous deeds which Allah has ordained), or conciliation between mankind” [al-Nisa’ 4:114]. And because the situation may dictate that payment be made immediately. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/233). He also said: scholars said that this applies to everyone who pays an obligatory debt on behalf of someone else. He may collect it, even without the permission (of the debtor), unless the debt is of the type where the intention of the debtor is stipulated, in which case he can only do that with permission, as in the case of zakah and expiation, because the one who has to pay the zakah did not intend that and did not ask anyone to do it on his behalf. An example of that is where a man comes and says: I am going to join the mujaahideen, give me some zakah money, and I know that my friend has a lot of zakah to be paid. So I gave this man 30,000 on the basis that it is my friend’s zakah -- can I get it back? The answer is no, because the intention is essential in the case of zakah, and in this case the one who owes zakah did not have that intention. But the 30,000 is not wasted; rather there is great reward with Allah for it and it will be charity on the part of the one who gave it. If I tell him about that and say: I gave zakah on your behalf, and he says: May Allah reward you with good, I give my consent for that, then according to the madhhab this does not count as zakah, because the intention was not there at the time when it was paid. But the correct view is that this is permissible, and the evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) and the story about his guarding the dates, when the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appointed him to guard the sadaqat al-fitr, and the Shaytaan came to him one night and took some of the dates. Abu Hurayrah grabbed him and the Shaytaan said that he was poor and had a family, so Abu Hurayrah felt sorry for him and let him go. This happened again on the second night, and on the third night he said: “You have to go to the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him.” He was afraid of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: “I will tell you of a verse, that if you recite it at night you will have a guardian with you from Allah and no devil will come near you until morning.” And he taught him Aayat al-Kurisy. The following morning, the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “What happened to your prisoner last night?” And he said: “He told you the truth even though he is a liar.” And he said: “Do you know who you have been talking to for the last three nights?” He said No.” He said: “That was a devil.” Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), when he gave some of that zakah, did not give it with the permission of the Messenger, but the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) allowed it. So the correct view is that if a person gives zakah on behalf of another person, and that person allows it, then the correct view is that it is valid and permissible. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (9/199). And Allah knows best."
Ruling on medicine for asthma that is made by Hindus who mention the names of their gods over it,"Question It is mentioned in the Quran in Surah al Bakarah Chapter 2 Verse 173 “He hath only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that on which any other name hath been invoked besides that of Allah. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless. For Allah is oft-forgiving and most merciful “. In India, there is a herbal medicine treatment for the permanent cure of asthma disease. This Herbal Medicine treatment is offered by the Non Muslim (Hindu) people, they pronounce the name of their gods and goddesses on the Herbal medicine which is given to the people as a medicine to cure their asthma. In above quoted verse Allah says you cannot eat any food (Medicine in this case) on which any name besides Allah hath been invoked, but if you are in necessity you are guiltless. Asthma is a horrible disease, which does not have permanent cure in the modern medicine. The only option remains before me is to have the Herbal medicine (On which name of Gairullah is pronounced) or to suffer the disease lifelong. Allah says you are guiltless under necessity. So my question is am I under necessity (If I don’t have any option to permanently cure my disease besides this Herbal Medicine on which names of other gods besides Allah hath been invoked).","Praise be to Allah. If the medicine is purely herbal and contains nothing from animals that have been slaughtered in the name of anything other than Allah, and does not contain anything impure and prohibited, such as alcohol or pork products, then what we think is that there is nothing wrong with you taking it and seeking healing by means of it, if it is proven to be efficacious from a medical point of view, even if it is made by Hindus who mention the names of their gods over it. That is for the following reasons: Firstly: The basic principle is that beneficial herbs and plants are permissible. Allah may He be glorified and exalted, caused them to grow in the interests of humanity and for their benefit, and bestowed this blessing upon His slaves. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “He it is Who sends down water (rain) from the sky; from it you drink and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture; With it He causes to grow for you the crops, the olives, the date-palms, the grapes, and every kind of fruit. Verily! In this is indeed an evident proof and a manifest sign for people who give thought” [an-Nahl 16:10-11]. This implies that this basic principle of permissibility remains in effect unless there is sound shar‘i evidence to the contrary. Because we do not find any factor which would imply that it is prohibited, such as if it were mixed with impure or prohibited substances, there is no proof that it is disallowed. The original ruling remains as it is. Secondly: There is nothing in the Qur’an or Sunnah to indicate that mentioning the name of other gods over food makes it prohibited. Because there is no such evidence, the basic principle that it is permissible remains in effect. Thirdly: With regard to the verse in which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “He has forbidden you only the Maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, etc., on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:173], what is meant by “that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering)” refers to meat, not all kinds of food. Meat from animals that have been slaughtered as a sacrifice for anyone other than Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and over which the name of any object of worship other than Allah, may He be exalted, was mentioned, is what is forbidden according to the Qur’an and Sunnah, and the opinions of the fuqaha’. Fourthly: Land animals are not to be eaten when alive; rather whatever is cut from them when they are alive is maytah (“dead meat” - that which was not slaughted in the prescribed manner). Therefore the intention is essential at the time of slaughter. If the intention or raising of the voice was for any object of worship other than Allah, may He be exalted, then the meat is tainted with the stain of shirk (polytheism) or bid‘ah (innovation), and the ruling that it is haram (prohibited) remains in effect. With regard to other types of food, such as that of plant origin, it remains as it is, permissible in principle. Therefore the mention of any name other than that of Allah over it is of no significance and the fact that it was cultivated or made for the sake of Allah, the true God, or for the sake of any false god, does not have any impact on whether it is permissible or prohibited. Therefore it is permissible to eat the food of the mushrikeen (polytheists) apart from meat, unless there is some other reason for which it should be regarded as haram, as stated above. Imam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: … i.e., anything over which the name of anyone other than Allah, may He be exalted, has been mentioned and is slaughtered by a Magian (Zoroastrian), idol-worshipper or one who denies the attributes of Allah. The idol-worshipper sacrifices it to the idol, the Magian sacrifices it to fire, and the one who denies the divine attributes does not believe in anything, so he slaughters it for himself. Ibn ‘Abbaas and others said: What is meant is that which is sacrificed to stones and idols. The custom of the Arabs was to call out the name of that for which the sacrifice was intended. This practice was so prevalent that it was taken as describing the intention, which is the reason for the prohibition of the meat. End quote from al-Jaami‘ li Ahkaam al-Qur’an (2/223). Fifthly: Moreover, their gods are false and worthless, and there is no ruling for that which is worthless, and it is of no significance and has no impact on the truth, which is the principle that it is permissible, by Allah’s leave. The haraam action that the mushrikoon do does not make haraam that which is permissible for people. Sixthly: Some reports and scholarly opinions say that it is permissible to eat the food of non-Muslims and people other than the people of the Book, with regard to that which is not slaughtered (i.e., food other than that of animal origin), and they did not differentiate between that which is made on their festivals or over which their incantations are recited, and that which was not subjected to that. Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated in al-Musannaf (5/126) from ‘Aa’ishah that a woman asked her: We have neighbours who are Magians, and they have a festival on which they give us gifts. She said: As for that which is slaughtered for that occasion, do not eat it, but eat from their produce (fruits, vegetables, etc). There is some weakness in its isnaad because of Qaboos ibn Abi Zubyaan. He was classed as da‘eef by Abu Haatim, Ibn Ma‘een and an-Nasaa’i, as it says in Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb (8/306). Ibn Abi Shaybah also narrated with his isnaad in al-Musannaf (5/126) from Abu Barzah that he had tenants who were Magians, and they used to give him gifts on the occasion of Nawruz (Persian New Year) and other festivals. He used to say to his family: Whatever grew on trees, eat it, and whatever is not like that, reject it. These people and others regarded it as permissible to eat the food of the Magians on their festivals, and usually the food eaten on festivals has some religious significance in most religions, yet despite that they ruled that it was permissible. The fuqaha’ also regarded it as permissible to take medicine made by non-Muslims, if it is free of harmful effects and impurities; the fuqaha’ did not stipulate that the Muslim should ascertain that it is free of their incantations and so on. Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Chapter on seeking medical treatment from non-Muslims… It is makrooh for a Muslim to seek medical treatment from a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) in non-essential cases or to take medicine from him when it is not clear whether its ingredients are permissible. The same applies to medicines that he prescribes or makes. This was mentioned in ar-Ri aayah and elsewhere. End quote from al-Adaab ash-Shar‘iyyah (2/441) This implies that if the ingredients are known, or it is known that it is permissible, and the sick person needs that medicine, then doing these things is not makrooh. Conclusion: All that is required of you with regard to the issue you mention of pronouncing of names other than the name of Allah is that you should avoid it yourself, and mention the name of Allah, may He be exalted, over your food and drink, and also over your medicine. If the name of any of these false gods is written on the container, then you should blot it out or discard the container, if this medicine does not need to be kept in it. Then after that there will be no blame on you for consuming the medicine that you mentioned in the question, but that is subject to three important conditions: 1.That it is established that it is free of haraam or impure substances. 2.That you should also confirm that it is indeed efficacious and beneficial; do not be deceived by rumours and people’s talk without clear evidence of its positive effect, otherwise this is a means that may lead to trickery and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, or it may be a means of causing harm to people and using them for experimental purposes. 3.That you should actually need the medicine to treat a sickness or alleviate its harmful effects. And Allah knows best."
Ruling on sexual fantasies,"Question We got married three and a half years ago, and he is very good and very religiously committed. We worship Allah together as much as we can, praise be to Allah. But the problem started with me from the beginning of the marriage. Whilst having intercourse, he had to tell me sexual stories and I would use my imagination, because I could not reach climax otherwise. In order to feel satisfied I have to fantasize. The problem with me is that I feel guilty every time after having intercourse, because the images that I fantasize about stay with me– I never imagine myself with any other person at all, only people whom I do not know. I told him about this problem and he did not get angry, but I feel like it is a kind of betrayal. What should I do? Please advise me. What is the Islamic ruling?","Praise be to Allah.Is it haram to have sexual fantasies? Sexual fantasies are among the thoughts that cross a person’s mind because it is something that is stored in the subconscious which is affected by the environment in which he lives and the scenes that he sees. These are thoughts that occur to most people, especially the youth, but they vary from one person to another with regard to their type, strength and effect. Islamic shari’ah is the shari’ah of the fitrah (natural state of man) and it is in harmony with human nature, and it takes into account the psychological fluctuation that Allah has made a part of the human make-up. So it does not go beyond human limitations or impose impossible burdens. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [al-Baqarah 2:286] Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah for whatever crosses their mind so long as they do not speak of it or act upon it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (2528) and Muslim (127) Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said commenting on this hadith: “Whatever crosses a person’s mind, so long as he does not dwell on it or continue to think of it, he is forgiven for it, according to scholarly consensus, because it does not happen voluntarily and he has no way of avoiding it.” (Al-Adhkar, p. 345) Passing fancies come under the heading of that which crosses a person’s mind, which is forgiven according to the hadith quoted above. So if a person imagines haram things that came to his mind unbidden, there is no blame or sin on him, rather he has to ward them off as much as he can. How does Islam view haram sexual fantasies? If a person dwells on haram thoughts and calls them to mind, then the jurists differed as to how to view this situation – is it covered by that forgiveness or does it come under the heading of thinking and resolving to do something haram) for which a person may be called to account? This issue was discussed by the jurists in the following manner: If a man is having intercourse with his wife and is thinking of the charms of another woman, so that he imagines he is having intercourse with her, are those thoughts and fantasies haram? The jurists differed concerning that. The first view is that it is haram, and that the one who deliberately brings haram images to mind whilst having intercourse with his wife is sinning. Ibn ‘Abidin al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The view that is closest to the spirit of our madhhab is that it is not permissible, because imagining that woman as if he is having intercourse with her is imagining oneself committing a sin with a woman who is not permissible for him.” (Hashiyat Radd al-Muhtar, 6/272) Imam Muhammad al-‘Abdari, who is known Ibn al-Haj al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him), said: “A man should refrain from thinking such thoughts and tell others to avoid this behaviour too, i.e., this obnoxious characteristic that has unfortunately become very common, which is when a man sees a woman whom he likes, he goes to his wife and has intercourse with her, and starts to imagine that woman whom he has seen. This is a kind of zina (adultery) because of what our scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have said about the one who takes a tankard and drinks water from it, but he imagines that it is alcohol that he is drinking – so that water becomes haram for him. What we have mentioned does not apply only to men, rather it also includes women, and it applies even more so to them, because what is common nowadays is that they go out or look out from windows, and if they see someone whom they like, they start thinking about him, then when they have intercourse with their husbands they bring that image that they have seen to mind, so each of them may be committing zina in some sense – we ask Allah to keep us safe from that. He should not only avoid that himself, he should also draw his family’s and other people’s attention to it, and tell them that this is haram and is not permitted.” (Al-Madkhil (2/194, 195) Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Ibn ‘Aqil stated in al-Ri’ayah al-Kubra that if a man imagines the image of another woman who is forbidden to him whilst having intercourse with his wife, he is sinning, but a passing thought that he cannot prevent does not constitute a sin.” (Al-Adab al-Shar’iyyah (1/98) The evidence for this opinion is the view favoured by a number of scholars, that if thoughts that cross the mind become entrenched and may turn into something that one resolves to do, then they come under the heading of things for which one is accountable, and that haram fantasies that a person deliberately calls to mind are not covered by forgiveness, because they have been thought of deliberately and the person will be called to account for that. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reason why passing thoughts are forgiven is what we have mentioned above, that they cannot be avoided. But it is possible to avoid dwelling on them. Hence dwelling on them is haram.” (Al-Adhkar (345) The second view is that it is permissible, and that there is no sin on the one who does that. This is the view of a number of later Shafi'i scholars, such as al-Subki and al-Suyuti. They said: That is because there is no resolve or determination to sin in fantasies. He may imagine that he is having intercourse with that woman, but there is no resolve in his heart or any plan to do that, rather he may refuse if given the opportunity to do it. It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaj fi Sharh al-Minhaj (7/205, 206) – which is a Shafi'i book: “Because when he thinks of that or imagines it, it does not occur to him to actually commit zina or do any of the things that lead to it, let alone resolve to do it. All that is happening to him is that he imagines something reprehensible as something good.” (See: al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra, 4/87) It seems that the correct view is the view that such fantasies are makruh, even if we do not say that they are haram. That is for the following reasons: Many psychologists regard sexual fantasies as a psychological disorder if they dominate a person’s thinking to such an extent that he cannot enjoy any pleasure except through these fantasies, and that may lead to abnormal sexual fantasies. Islamic shari’ah teaches the principle of sadd al-dharai’ or blocking the means that may lead to haram things and closing every door that may lead to evil. It is to be expected that sexual fantasies may lead to a person committing haram deeds. A person who frequently imagines something and wishes for it will inevitably develop the motive to do it and will try to do it a great deal. So he starts by looking at haram images, and his eyes become accustomed to looking at haram things, then he will try to fulfil his fantasies. Most of these fantasies come to people’s mind by haram means in people’s minds, such as permissive satellite channels and by watching scenes of decadent societies from kafir lands all over the world, where there is no modesty and watching sex scenes is becoming a daily habit, as is obvious to anyone who lives or works in those countries. Finally, such fantasies may lead to spouses losing interest in one another, so the wife is no longer attractive to her husband, and vice versa, which leads to marital problems, and then sufferings and problems start. How to avoid sexual fantasies For all of these reasons, our advice to everyone who is tested with such fantasies is to hasten to put a stop to them and rid himself of them. The following means may be of help: Completely avoiding everything that may provoke such fantasies, such as haram movies and TV shows which are shown on satellite TV, as well as avoiding reading stories that generate such fantasies. Al-Ghazali said in Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din (1/162): The way to ward off distracting thoughts is to cut off their source, i.e. avoid the means that could create these thoughts; if the source of such thoughts is not stopped, it will keep generating them.” Regularly reciting the adhkar that are prescribed in shari’ah, especially that which is said before having intercourse: “Allahumma jannibna al-shaytana wa jannib al-shaytana ma razaqtana (O Allah, keep the Shaytan away from us and keep the Shaytan away from that with which You bless us).” Narrated by al-Bukhari (141)and Muslim (1434). Focusing on the present enjoyment instead of that which is absent. In both spouses there is that which will keep the other from thinking of haram things. If each spouse focuses on the attractions of the other, they will not be distracted by fantasies of other things. Imagine if your husband had fantasies like you do, would you accept that? Wouldn’t that make you feel unhappy? How can you accept to make your husband feel like that? Try to use this thought to get rid of what you are feeling. Consult psychologists. There is nothing wrong with going to a female psychologist or female doctor and asking her for advice; you may find something to help you in sha Allah. I ask Allah to guide and bless you and your husband. And Allah knows best."
Is it permissible for him to sell gifts that have to do with kaafir festivals?,"Question There is a factory that makes glass gifts, such as perfume bottles and candlesticks and exports them to other countries. I have been offered a position with responsibility for exports, but the factory will ask me to make some gifts that are just for Christian holidays (Christmas) such as crosses and images. Is this work permissible? I fear Allaah now that I have been blessed with some knowledge and have memorized His Book.","Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for any Muslim to join in the festivals of the kuffaar, whether by attending the festivities or enabling them to hold their celebrations, or selling any goods or products that have to do with these festivals. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote to the Minister for Trade, saying: From Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem to His Excellency the Minister for Trade, may Allaah preserve him. Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings. We have been told that last year, some traders imported gifts for Christmas and the Christian New Year, including Christmas trees, and that some citizens bought these and gave them as gifts to Christian foreigners in our country, joining them in this festival. This is an evil action which they should not have done. Undoubtedly you know that this is not permissible, and you are aware of what the scholars have said about there being scholarly consensus on the prohibiton on joining the kuffaar, mushrikeen and people of the Book in their festivals. We hope that you will issue a ban on these gifts that have been brought into our country and other things that come under the same ruling and are things that are unique to their celebrations. Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, 3/105. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Some Muslims join the Christians in their celebrations. What is your advice? He replied: It is not permissible for any Muslim man or woman to join the Christians, Jews or other kaafirs in their festivals, rather that must be avoided, because “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us against imitating them and adopting their ways. So the believer, man or woman, must beware of that; it is not permissible to help them in doing that in any way, because these festivals are against sharee’ah, so it is prohibited to take part in them or to cooperate with the people who are celebrating it, or help them in any way, whether by helping them to serve tea or coffee or in other ways such as providing vessels etc, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment” [al-Maa'idah 5:2] Joining in with the kuffaar on their holidays is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression. Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/405 In a statement issued by the scholars of the Standing Committee concerning joining in celebrations of the Millennium, they said: … It is not permissible for a Muslim to cooperate with the kuffaar in any way with regard to their festivals, such as announcing and publicizing their festivals, including the Millennium mentioned above, or promoting them by any means, whether that is via the media or by setting up a clock to “count down” to the Millennium, or making clothes or other items that commemorate the occasion, or printing greeting cards or stationery marking this occasion, or offering special discounts or prizes on these occasions, or holding sporting events or producing special logos for them etc. Based on this, it is not permissible for you to participate in making anything that has to do with the festivals of the kuffaar; you should leave this job for the sake of Allaah, and Allaah will compensate you with something better than it in sha Allaah. And Allaah knows best."
Beware of the Whispers of the Shaytan about Allah,"Question For two weeks this question has been haunting me and I cannot find an answer to it, but in sha Allah you will have the answer: What is the evidence that Allah does not lie, or what is the evidence that He always tells the truth, and why will He never lie? I know that this is a strange question, and I felt too embarrassed to ask anyone about it for a while, but I looked for an answer and I feel a kind of anxiety even when praying.","Praise be to Allah.By Allah, we do not know which of your two issues we find stranger, that you have gone along with the whispers of the shaytan (devil) to such an extent that brought you to the brink of the abyss and nearly made you fall in, or that you find this question difficult and are not able to find an answer to it. What do you know of your religion, if you do not know this? What do you think of your Lord, if you are asking about this? When her freed slave asked her: O my mother, did Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) see his Lord? ‘Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, (may Allah be pleased with her) said: My hair stood on end at what you said. If the hair of the Mother of the Believers stood on end because of alarm for the one who asked her this question: Did Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) see his Lord, i.e., in this world – although the believers will see Him in Paradise and that will be the greatest of their joys (may Allah not deprive us of it) – then how should one react to your question? Have you left your heart empty to such an extent that the shaytan can toy with it and cause it to end up like this? Have you heard of the report narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from Jabir who said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I saw in a dream as if my head was cut off. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled and said: If the shaytaan toys with one of you in his sleep, he should not tell the people about it.” If a dream such as this is regarded as the shaytan toying with a person, then what would the Prophet’s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) response be to one who saw what you have seen in a dream? What would he say if the shaytan toyed with him when he was awake, and not in a dream? It is natural that you should feel ashamed and you should weep for yourself if the shaytan has gained so much power over you. Yes, we understand that the shaytan may toy with a person in such ways, but he should not go along with the ideas instilled by the shaytan and try to discuss it and look for evidence for it. Rather his deeply rooted faith should protect him, for the shaytan is evil and his plot is weak: “… ever feeble indeed is the plot of shaytan (Satan).” [4:76]. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The shaytan comes to some of you and says, ‘Who created such and such? Who created such and such?’ – until he says, ‘Who created your Lord?’ If that happens, then let him seek refuge with Allah and stop thinking about that.” What do you think the Prophet’s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) answer would be to this “difficult” question posed by the accursed enemy? One should seek refuge with Allah from this waswas (insinuating whisper), and stop thinking about it or getting carried away with it, because the accursed one does not need an answer to this question. He knows that his question is pure fallacy, for it is not befitting that the Creator should have a creator, otherwise He would be another created being. Rather his aim is to stir up doubts until he gains control over one who dies in such a state, if he can. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadeeth (report) quoted above: “‘Who created your Lord?’ If that happens, then let him seek refuge with Allah and stop thinking about that” i.e., let him stop getting carried away with that, and turn to Allah in warding it off; he should realize that he (shaytan) wants to corrupt his religious commitment and his reasoning with these whispers, so he should strive to ward them off by thinking of something else. Al-Khattabi said: The point of this hadeeth is that if the shaytan whispers such thoughts, one should seek refuge with Allah from him and stop debating with the shaytan about it, then this waswas will diminish. There is no end to the shaytan’s whispers, rather every time proof is produced to silence him, he moves on to something else until he finally makes one confused. We seek refuge with Allah from that. … But his saying ‘Who created your Lord?” is contradictory and is a flawed argument, because it is impossible for the Creator to be created. Al-Teebi said: Rather he enjoined seeking refuge with Allah and distracting oneself with something else; he did not tell us to ponder and look for evidence, because the knowledge that Allah does not need a creator is a basic fact that is not open to debate, and because getting carried away in thinking about that will only make a person more confused. If a person is in such a state, he has no option except to turn to Allah and seek His protection. The hadeeth also implies criticism of asking too much about that which does not concern one and that which one has no need to ask about. It is also one of the signs of Prophethood, namely his foretelling something that was going to happen and then it happened. End quote. As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined putting an end to such whispers and not indulging in them, then the believer, if he is overwhelmed by any such thing, and if the accursed enemy instills such a thing in his heart, then he will regard this waswas as something serious that has befallen him. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Some of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and asked him: We find in ourselves something that is too awful for any of us to speak of it. He said: “Do you really find that?” They said: Yes. He said: “That is clear faith.” [ Muslim] Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What this means is: The fact that you think of this waswas as something terrible is a clear sign of faith, for if you dare not utter it and you are so afraid of it and of speaking of it, let alone believing it, this is the sign of one who has achieved perfect faith and who is free of doubt O slave of Allah, the man of dignity who has some standing among people would refrain from lying and would hate lies to be attributed to him. The story of Abu Sufyan with Heraclius concerning this matter is well known, so how about if this noble and dignified man is a believer? For lying is incompatible with faith. How about if one imagines the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) telling lies when he is the truthful one? This is an idea that would make the skin crawl and the hair stand on end. It seems most likely that there are two reasons why the shaytan has gained control over you: 1- You have turned away from focusing on remembrance (dhikr) of the Most Merciful, studying His verses and what it says in His Book of His most beautiful names and sublime attributes, and acknowledging His greatness, majesty, beauty and perfection that are mentioned in His Book and in the sunnah (teachings) of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 2- Perhaps it is a punishment from Allah because of the first reason, which is your keeping company with the devils among men, who have been supported by the devils among the jinn and helped by them against you. Those companions were not necessarily friends of yours who come and go with you, rather that may have been via the internet as idle curiosity may have led you to go to some atheist and anti-religion chat rooms, where one of them stated his specious argument and it settled in your heart and led to the problem that you are now suffering. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allah) (i.e. this Quran and worship of Allah), We appoint for him shaytan (Satan ‑ devil) to be a Qareen (a companion) to him. And verily, they (Satans / devils) hinder them from the path (of Allah), but they think that they are guided aright! Till, when (such a one) comes to Us, he says [to his Qareen (Satan/devil companion)] ‘Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts (or the east and west) a worst (type of) companion (indeed)! It will profit you not this Day (O you who turn away from Allah’s remembrance and His worship) as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers (you and your Qareen) in the punishment.” [43:36] Set your heart straight and turn to your Lord, and acknowledge Him as He has told you in His Book. Turn to His Book and read it and ponder it, and keep your tongue busy with remembrance of Him (dhikr), for that will protect you: “I command you to remember Allah, for the likeness of that is that of a man whose enemy comes after him, until he comes to a strong fortress where he protects himself from him. Similarly, a person cannot protect himself against the shaytan except by remembering Allah.” [Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh/authentic by al-Albani.] And Allah knows best."
Shaving Head in Islam,Question Is t sunnah to shave the head?,"Praise be to Allah.What may be understood from the words of the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) is that shaving the head is of six kinds: 1 – An act of worship and a means of drawing closer to Allaah, for which a person will be rewarded. This applies in four cases only, to which there is no fifth: (i)Hajj (ii)‘Umrah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Indeed Allaah shall fulfil the true vision which He showed to His Messenger [i.e. the Prophet saw a dream that he has entered Makkah along with his Companions, having their (head) hair shaved and cut short] in very truth. Certainly, you shall enter Al-Masjid Al-Haraam, if Allaah wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short” [al-Fath 48:27] (iii)Shaving the child’s head on the seventh day after birth. The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1439) from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) offered a sheep as ‘aqeeqah for al-Hasan, and said: ‘O Faatimah, shave his head and give the weight of his hair in silver in charity.’” (Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1226. See also Tuhfat al-Mawlood by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 217). (iv)The kaafir when he becomes a Muslim, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood (356) which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded a kaafir man who had become Muslim, “Shave off the hair of kufr and get circumcised.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood; see also al-Mughni, 1/276; Sharh al-‘Umdah by Shaykh al-Islam, 1/350) The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) were agreed that it is not recommended to shave the head at times other than these four. See al-Istiqaamah by Shaykh al-Islam, 1/256. 2 – Shirk (the association of others with Allaah). Shaving the head may be a form of shirk, when the head is shaved as an act of humbling oneself before someone other than Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (4/195): “Such as when the mureeds (disciples of Sufi shaykhs) shave their heads for their shaykhs, and one of them says, ‘I shaved my head for So and so.’ This is like saying, ‘I prostrated to So and so,’ because shaving the head is an act of humility and submission, which is why it is one of the acts that complete the Hajj, for it means putting one’s forelock in the hand of its Lord, in submission to His greatness and humbling oneself before His glory. It is one of the most eloquent forms of submission. Hence when the Arabs wanted to humiliate their prisoners and free them, they would shave their heads and let them go…” 3 – A reprehensible innovation (bid’ah) – this takes many forms, such as: Shaving the head as an act of worship and religious devotion – other than in the four cases mentioned above – such as making a shaved head a sign of righteousness or complete asceticism (zuhd). This is what the Khawaarij used to do. Hence it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described the Khawaarij as “their sign will be that they shave their heads.” (al-Bukhaari, 7007; Muslim, 1763). Al-Qurtubi said: “ ‘Their sign will be that they shave their heads’ means that they will make that a symbol of their rejection of worldly adornments and a sign by which they might be known. This is ignorance on their part… and introducing something into the religion of Allaah which differs from that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs and their followers used to do.” (See Sharh al-‘Umdah, 1/231; Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/118). Another example is that which some people do, ordering a person who has repented to shave his head. This is a bid’ah (innovation) which was not done by any of the Sahaabah or those who followed them in truth, or by any of the imams of the Muslims. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/118) 4 – Haraam kinds of shaving the head, which takes a number of forms, such as: (i)Shaving the head when calamity strikes, such as the death of a relative and the like. It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) disowned the woman who raises her voice in lament, the one who shaves her hair at times of calamity and the one who rends her garment.” Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned in al-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir the 117th major sin: shaving the head at times of calamity. He said: “Because that is showing discontent and a lack of acceptance of the divine decree.” (ii)Shaving the head in a manner that resembles the kuffaar or immoral people who are well known for shaving their heads. A person might do that as a kind of adornment, to make himself look like them, or he might shave the hair at the sides of the head and leave the middle long. All of these are haraam forms of imitating others, and a form of promiscuity and decadence – we ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4031; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3401). Al-Faari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: i.e., whoever makes himself resemble the kuffaar or immoral people, then he is one of them, i.e., he shares the sin with them. 5 – Permissible – i.e., shaving the head for a reason, such as shaving it as a remedy for disease, or to prevent lice and so on. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This is permissible according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 12/117) 6 – Shaving the head for none of the reasons stated above. This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. Some of them regarded it as makrooh, such as Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him), and they quoted as evidence the fact that it is the sign of the followers of innovation, namely the Khawaarij, as stated in the hadeeth quoted above. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Those who regard it as permissible quoted as evidence the report narrated by Abu Dawood (4192) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to the family of Ja’far ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) three days after Ja’far had died, and called for a barber and told him to shave the heads of his sons. (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3532). And Abu Dawood narrated (4195) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a child who had part of his head shaved and not other parts. He said: “Shave it all or leave it all.” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3535). Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “This clearly shows that it is permissible to shave the head, and it cannot be interpreted in any other way.” (Sharh Muslim). But using these two hadeeth to show that it is permissible to shave the head for no reason is a matter which is subject to further discussion. Firstly, shaving the head here is for a reason, so it is permissible, the reason being that boys are more likely than others to be affected by lice, because they sweat a lot and get dirty. Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/159. Secondly, this has to do with a young boy, and concessions are made for children that are not made for adults. Haashiyat al-Sindi ‘ala al-Nasaa’i. See also Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/119; Sharh al-‘Umdah, 1/230. There is some difference of opinion concerning the fifth type: is shaving the head makrooh or permissible? It is preferable not to shave it. Al-Faawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is better not to shave it unless that is for Hajj or ‘Umrah, as was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). (From ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, 11/248). And Allaah knows best."
Going to the house of the second wife on a day or night that is not hers,Question Is it permissible for the husband to visit his second wife in a day that is not hers (it is for the first wife) just to ask how her health is because she is ill?.,"Praise be to Allah. If the husband goes out of the house of the wife whose day it is and goes to the house of the other wife, that is subject to further discussion: (a) If it is during the day, and the division is on the basis of nights, then it is permissible in case of need, such as dropping things off, handing over money for maintenance, finding out news, and visiting her if she is sick and so on, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not favour one of us over another with regard to division of his time and how long he stayed with us, and there was rarely a day when he did not go around to all of us, and he would draw close to each wife without having intercourse, until he reached the one whose day it was, then he would stay overnight with her. Sawdah bint Zam’ah said, when she grew old and feared that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would leave her: O Messenger of Allaah, my day is for ‘Aa’ishah; and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted that from her. Narrated by Abu Dawood (2135); al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood: (it is) hasan saheeh. It is permissible for the husband to be intimate with his wife when he enters upon her, without having intercourse, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would enter upon me when it was the day of another of his wives, and he would do everything with me except intercourse. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (2023). He should not stay with her for long, and if he stays too long he should make it up to the one whose turn it is. (b) As for going out to the other wife at night, it is not permissible except in case of necessity, such as if she is gravely ill, or giving birth and her contractions are severe, or there is fear of robbery and fire; if he stays with her too long then he should make it up to the one whose turn it is. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: As for entering upon her co-wife when it is her turn: If it is at night, it is not permissible except in case of necessity, such as if she is dying, and he wants to be with her or she wants to give him final requests (a will), or something else that is essential. If he does do that, and he does not stay long before he leaves, he does not have to make it up. If he stays and the sick wife recovers, then he should make it up to the other wife, staying as long as he stayed with (the one who sick). If he goes there for something that is not necessary, he is sinning, and the ruling is that he should make it up, just as if he went there for a necessary reason, because there is no point in making up a short time. As for entering upon a wife during the day when it is the turn of another, that is permissible in the case of need, such as giving her maintenance, visiting her if she is sick, asking about something that he needs to know, or visiting her because he has not seen her for a while and so on, because of the report narrated by ‘Aa’ishah who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would enter upon me when it was the day of another of his wives, and he would do everything with me except intercourse. When he enters upon her, he should not have intercourse with her and he should not stay with her for long, because that means that he has dwelt with her and she is not entitled to that. If he stays too long with her, he should make it up (to the other wife). End quote from al-Mughni (7/234). Based on that, if the husband’s going to the house of the wife whose turn it is not happens by day, for the reason that you mention of checking on her, then there is no sin on him for that, and he should not stay there for a long time, except in case of necessity. If it happens at night, it is not permissible for him to go to her unless it is an emergency, such as if she is very sick or the wife whose turn it is gives him permission. If he stays there for a long time then he must make it up to the other wife, spending as long with her as he did with (the wife whose house he went to out of turn). And Allaah knows best."
Will We See Allah in Jannah?,Question Is it proven that the believers will see their Lord in the Hereafter?,"Praise be to Allah.Proof for seeing Allah in Jannah from the Quran The blessings which Allah bestows upon His slaves cannot be counted. Allah has singled out the believers for additional blessings in this world, as He has blessed them with Islam, and chosen them to be guided by the Quran, and He will bless them in Paradise with the greatest special blessing that He can bestow upon them, which is the honour of seeing His holy Face in the Paradise of `Adan , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Some faces that Day shall be shining (and radiant). Looking at their Lord (Allah).” [Al-Qiyamah :22-23] I.e., the faces of the believers will be beautiful and radiant, joyful because they are looking at the Face of their Lord. Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They will look at their Lord and their faces will become radiant with His Light.” Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “[The phrase] ‘Some faces that Day shall be shining (and radiant)’ means, because of the blessing. ‘Looking at their Lord’ means, looking upon the Face of their Lord.” This is the opinion of the scholars who interpreted the Quran among the scholars of the Sunnah and Hadith. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They will have all that they desire and We have more.” [Qaaf 50:35] What is meant by “more” here is looking upon the Face of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, as that was interpreted by `Ali and Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with them). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “For those who have done good is the best reward and even more.” [Yunus 10:26] The “best reward” is Paradise, and “even more” is looking upon the Face of Allah, as explained by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in the narration by Muslim in (266) from Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him), according to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allah will say, ‘Do you want anything more?’ They will say, ‘Have You not brightened our faces, admitted us to Paradise, and saved us from Hell?’ Then the veil will be lifted and they will not have seen anything dearer to them than looking upon their Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted. This is what is meant by ‘even more.’” Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “For those who have done good is the best reward and even more .” [Yunus 10:26] So, once you know that the people of Paradise will not be given anything there that is dearer to them than looking upon the Face of their Lord, it will become clear to you just how great is the deprivation and loss that awaits the sinners whom Allah warns with the words (interpretation of the meaning): “Nay! Surely, they (evil doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Al-Mutafiffun 83:15] We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound How beautiful are the words of Ash-Shafi`i, which were narrated from him by Ar-Rabi` ibn Sulayman – who was one of his students – who said: “I was with Muhammad ibn Idris [i.e., Ash-Shafi`i], who had received a letter from Upper Egypt in which it said, ‘What do you say about the verse, “Nay! Surely, they (evil doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Al-Mutafiffun 83:15] Ash-Shafi`i said: “Because they will be veiled by the wrath (of Allah), this indicates that the allies of Allah will see Him because He is pleased with them.’” This is some of the evidence from the Quran which proves that the believers will see their Lord in Paradise . Proof for seeing Allah in Jannah from the Sunnah With regard to the evidence in the Sunnah, there is a great deal of it. For example: Al-Bukhari (6088) and Muslim (267) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people said: “O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?” The Messenger of Allah said, “Do you doubt that you see the moon on the night when it is full?” They said, “No, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do you doubt that you see the sun when there is no cloud?” They said, “No, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “You will see Him likewise.” According to a report narrated by Al-Bukhari: “you will not have any doubts or disputes concerning seeing Him,” and seeing Him will not cause you any hardship or make you tired. And Allah knows best. Summarised from Sharh Muslim. Also in Al-Bukhari (6883) and Muslim (1002), it is narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), looking at the moon on the night of the fourteenth (of the month). He said, ‘You will see your Lord with your own eyes just as you are looking at this (moon), without any doubt that you are seeing Him.’” The comparison in this Hadith is between seeing and seeing, i.e., just as we see the sun in all clarity on a cloudless day, and no one prevents anyone else from seeing it despite the large numbers of people looking at it, and just as we see the moon completely on the night when it is full, and we see it so clearly, despite the large numbers of people who are looking at it, so too the believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection, so fully and clearly. But there is no comparison in the Hadiths between what is seen in one case and the other, may Allah be exalted far above such a thing, for there is nothing like unto Allah, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. Al-Bukhari (4500) and Muslim (6890) narrated from Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Two gardens of silver, their vessels and everything in them, and two gardens of gold, their vessels and everything in them. And there will be nothing preventing the people from seeing their Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, except the veil of pride concealing His Face in the Paradise of `Adan.” The Hadiths about seeing Allah were narrated by nearly thirty Companions. So whoever claims after this that no one will see Allah in the Hereafter is rejecting the Quran and the message with which Allah sent His Messengers, and he is exposing himself to the stern warning mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Nay! Surely, they (evil doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Al-Mutafiffun 83:15] We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and we ask Him to bestow upon us the joy of seeing His holy Face…. Amen. References: Sharh al-‘Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah, 1/209 ff; A`lam As-Sunnah Al-Manshurah by Al-Hukami, p. 141. For more details, please see the following answers: 164119 , 12423 , and 2734 .

Playing Qur’aan in the audio chat room in which there is music,Question What is the ruling on playing Qur’aan in audio chat rooms in which there is music and cameras?.,"Praise be to Allah.This action is not something that is prescribed in sharee’ah, and it may cause people to be put off Qur’aan and not respect it, and they may want to stop the recitation, in addition to the fact that they will be busy with other things and will not pay attention to it. That may also be accompanied by other evil actions. The one who wants to offer advice should enter the chat room and explain the shar’i ruling on music and images; it is not sufficient to recite Qur’aan or play a recording. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Tibyaan fi Adaab Hamalat al-Qur’aan (p. 92): What should be paid attention to and is showing respect to the Qur’aan and avoiding matters that some negligent reciters do not pay attention to. For example: not laughing, engaging in idle talk and speaking during the recitation, apart from essential talk, in obedience to the words of Allaah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Qur’aan is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A’raaf 7:204]. That also includes not fidgeting with one’s hands and so on, for one is conversing with one’s Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, so one should not fidget before Him. That also includes not looking at things that may distract one and not letting one’s mind wander. Even worse than all of that is looking at that at which it is not permissible to look, such as beardless youths and so on. If those who are attending a gathering of Qur’aan recitation see any of these evils or any others, they should denounce it as much as possible, taking action to stop it if they can or speaking out against it if they cannot take action, otherwise let them denounce it in their hearts. And Allaah knows best. End quote. Al-Bahooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’ (1/433) that Ibn ‘Aqeel (may Allaah have mercy on him) stated that it is haraam to read Qur’aan in the marketplaces where people shout to sell their wares, and he quoted him as saying: Hanbal said: Many words and actions are done as acts of obedience by the common folk, but they are regarded as sins by the scholars, such as reading Qur’aan in the marketplaces where people shout to sell their wares, and the people of the marketplace are not able to hear it, and that is a kind of disrespect. End quote. The following question was addressed to the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas: The specialist hospital has an excellent internal communication system which allows a person to put a caller on hold, and answer another call for a short or long period, then go back to the first caller. During this period when he is on hold, the caller can listen to some appropriate recorded material. We wanted to fill this period with some religious material, such as portions of Qur’aan or hadeeth. But because this religious material may be interrupted with talk about worldly matters which may include serious talk and joking, depending on the status and circumstances of the speakers, we thought that we should consult you first, before we introduce this religious material. They replied: Firstly: It is not permissible to put the caller on hold, because that causes annoyance, unless there is a reason for that, such as if the caller is behaving badly and it cannot be stopped except by cutting him off, or if some emergency arises. Secondly: The Holy Qur’aan is the Word of Allaah, which must be respected and guarded against anything inappropriate such as mixing it with jokes before or after the recitation, or using it as entertainment or something to fill empty time, as you have mentioned. Rather one should intend to listen to it properly with the aim of worshipping Allaah and drawing closer to Him, whilst pondering its meanings and learning lessons from it, not just for entertainment and to fill time. The same applies to the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): it is not permissible to mix them with jokes and chitchat, rather we should pay attention to it and guard it against anything that is inappropriate. The aim should be to learn the rulings of sharee’ah from it and act upon it. End quote. ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (4/84) Undoubtedly what is going on in the chat rooms is far more serious than what is mentioned in the question put to the Committee. Hence we say: You must protect the Qur’aan from such situations, for the Qur’aan is too great to be recited alongside music; in that case it may happen that it is being recited to people who are careless and heedless, let alone those who are engaged in haraam things. We do not advise anyone to enter these websites and programs, apart from daa’iyahs who are equipped with sufficient knowledge and insight to ward off specious arguments and who have strong faith which will help them to resist whims and desires. People should keep themselves busy with that which will benefit them, and make use of good and decent web sites, for hearts are weak and specious arguments may have a great impact. A person may go in with the intention of offering advice, but will soon become one of those who become confused. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. May Allaah help us to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows best."
Credit cards,"Question Nowadays many people use “Credit” cards (credit cards) which are issued by some of the banks. The gold cards cost 548 riyals and the silver cards cost 245 riyals. This amount is paid to the bank annually by the person who uses the Credit card, like an annual subscription. The way these cards are used is that the card allows the bearer to withdraw as much money as he wants from the bank’s branches as a loan, and he has to repay the same amount of money within a period not exceeding fifty-four days. If he does not pay it back within the period stated, the bank will charge interest of 1.95 riyals for each hundred riyals of money withdrawn. The bank also charges 3.50 riyals for every hundred riyals of cash withdrawn by the carrier of the card, or a minimum of 45 riyals for every cash withdrawal. The carrier of this card is also entitled to buy products in stores that the bank deals with, without paying any cash, and it becomes a loan from the bank. If he delays paying off the cost of what he has bought for more than fifty-four days, they will charge 1.95 riyals for every hundred of the price of the products purchased from the stores that the bank deals with. What is the ruling on using these cards and subscribing annually to the bank in order to use these cards?.","Praise be to Allah.This question was put to the Standing Committee, who replied: If the credit card is as described, then it is a new kind of riba-based transaction and of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, making them fall into sin and contaminating their earnings and dealings. It comes under the same rulings as the riba of the Jaahiliyyah which is forbidden in sharee’ah. (Either you pay it off at the appointed time or you increase the amount). Hence it is not permissible to issue such cards or to use them. And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about this and he said: The answer is that a contract of this type is not permissible, because it involves riba which is the price of the card, and it also means committing to pay interest if payment is delayed."
Having intercourse with one wife in front of the other,"Question Is it permissible for a man married to two or more woman to engagane sexual encounters with his wives all at once? Meaning : can he have sex with one wife and have the second wife join, even if they can't see each other?.","Praise be to Allah.Having intercourse with one wife in the presence of the other and where she can see is something concerning which there should be no dispute that it is haraam. 1 – al-Hasan al-Basri said: They – meaning the Sahaabah and senior Taabi’een – used to regard wajs as makrooh, which means having intercourse with one when the other can hear the sounds. The word “makrooh” according to the earlier scholars means that it is haraam. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 4/388 2 – Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If two wives agree to live together in one house, that is permissible, because they each have the right to their own house, but they may give up that right. Similarly they may agree to let him sleep between them in one bed. But if they agree to let him have intercourse with one of them when the other one is looking, that is not permissible, because it is vile and despicable and is not appropriate, and it does not become permissible even if they agree to it. al-Mughni, 8/137 3 – al-Hajaawi the author of Zaad al-Mustanqi’ said: It is makrooh to have intercourse where anyone can see. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen commented on these words by saying: It is very strange that he limited himself to describing it as makrooh. This covers two issues. The first is having intercourse where the awrahs of both partners can be seen. Undoubtedly limiting oneself to saying that this is makrooh is a mistake, because it is obligatory to cover the ‘awrah. If it is in a place where anyone can see their ‘awrahs, this is undoubtedly haraam, and what this author says is not correct at all. The second is having intercourse in a place where the ‘awrah cannot be seen. Limiting oneself to saying that this is makrooh is also subject to further discussion. For example, if they are covered with a blanket and he starts to have intercourse with her, and the movements can be seen. This is undoubtedly more likely to be haraam, because it is not appropriate for a Muslim to lower himself to such a level. This may also provoke desire in the person who sees this, and that may lead to evil consequences. The correct view concerning this matter is that it is haraam to have intercourse with a woman in view of anyone, unless the onlooker is a child who does not understand what is happening; in this case it does not matter. But if the child understands what is happening then intercourse should not take place where he can see, even if he is a child, because a child may speak about what he has seen unintentionally. Sharh Kitaab al-Nikaah min Zaad al-Mustanqi’, tape 17. And Allaah knows best."
Ruling on scented antiperspirant for women,"Question What is the ruling on using antiperspirant, noting that it has a fragrance, but I cannot do without it, because I sweat a great deal when I am at the University?","Praise be to Allah.It is possible to divide the types of antiperspirant – in terms of ruling on a woman using them – into two categories: The first category is antiperspirants that are scented with a discernible fragrance. It is not permissible for a woman to use this type outside the house, if she thinks it most likely that she will walk past some men and they will smell the fragrance. The evidence for that is the hadith of Zaynab, the wife of ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with them both), who said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us: “When one of you comes to the mosque, let her not put on any perfume.” Narrated by Muslim (443). As he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade women to go out to the mosque wearing perfume, because it was most likely that men would notice the fragrance because the place was small and there was no barrier between the men and women, then it is more appropriate that a woman who is going out to the marketplace and other places where people gather should not be allowed to use perfume. There are other hadiths which speak of that, some of which have been quoted previously in the answer to question no. 102329 . The second category is unscented antiperspirants, or those that have a light fragrance that is not obvious and does not go beyond the user. There is nothing wrong with a woman using this type, and there is no reason to disallow it. Ar-Ramli ash-Shaafa‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In the case of a woman, it is not allowed for her to put on perfume and wear adornment and fancy clothes when she wants to attend [the mosque]. In fact, it is appropriate for her to rid herself of unpleasant odours. End quote . Ash-Shabraamalsi commented on these words, saying: “In fact, it is appropriate for her to rid herself of unpleasant odours” means: Even if what is used to remove unpleasant odours has a fragrance, as this is the only way to achieve that result – but is on condition that men cannot smell that fragrance. End quote from Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (2/340). But if the woman thinks it most likely that she will not pass any men; rather she will be among other women like her, in that case there is nothing wrong with her using perfume or antiperspirant. And Allah knows best."
Ruling on watching game shows and on entering prize draws,"Question What is ruling concerning attending/watching game shows such as ""Wheel of Fortune"", etc.? Also, in general, is it permissible to enter oneself in a drawing for a prize, say a car?.","Praise be to Allah. It is not appropriate for a Muslim to waste his time in things that will not benefit him, so how about spending time doing things that are sinful or haraam? The time that a person wastes in his day is part of his life, and he should use it in doing things that will bring him closer to his Lord and avoid wasting it in doing haraam or evil things. The program which the questioner mentions is a foolish program which the Muslim should not watch, in which women appear improperly dressed and in which young men and women appear together as boyfriend-girlfriend couples and the like, and in which the contestant collects a large amount of money then loses it if the wheel lands on the word “Bankrupt”. How can the viewer denounce what he sees of nakedness and gambling? Secondly: There is nothing wrong with a Muslim buying a product and then entering a prize draw from that company, but that is subject to conditions: Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Companies nowadays offer prizes to those who buy from them, and we say that there is nothing wrong with this, subject to two conditions: The first condition: The price of the item purchased should be its true price, i.e., the price should not be raised in order to cover the cost of the prize. If the price is raised in order to cover the cost of the prize, then this is gambling and is not permitted. The second condition: The person should not buy the item in order to try to win the prize. If he buys it only in order to try to win the prize, and he has no real use for the item, then this is a waste of money. We have heard that some people buy cartons of milk or yogurt which they do not need, but they buy it for a chance of winning the prize. So you find that they buy it and pour it out in the marketplace or on the way home. This is not permissible, because it is a waste of money, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has forbidden wasting money. As’ilah al-Baab al-Maftooh, no. 1162. And Allaah knows best."
Hadiths which speak of the virtues of Soorat Qaaf and Soorat al-Jumu‘ah,Question Are there any particular virtues in reciting Soorat Qaaf and Soorat al-Jumu‘ah?,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to Soorat al-Jumu‘ah, we have noted previously in the answer to question no. 121646 that there is no sound report which speaks of its virtue, except that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite it in the first rak‘ah of Jumu‘ah prayer, and in the second rak‘ah he would recite Soorat al-Munaafiqoon. With regard to Soorat Qaaf, a number of hadiths have been narrated concerning it, including the following: 1- The report narrated by Muslim (891) from ‘Ubaydullah ibn ‘Abdillah, according to which ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab asked Abu Waaqid al-Laythi: What did the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in [the prayer of Eid] al-Adha and al-Fitr? He said: He used to recite in them {Qaf. Wa’l-Qur’an il-majeed} [Soorat Qaf] and {Iqtarabat is-saa‘atu wa’nshaqqa al-qamar} [Soorat al-Qamar]. 2- Muslim also narrated (873) that Umm Hishaam bint Haarithah ibn an-Nu‘maan said: I only memorized Qaaf from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), when he recited it in his khutbah every Friday. She said: And our oven and the oven of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were the same. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The reason for choosing Qaaf was because it contains mention of the resurrection, death, stern exhortation and firm deterrents. This indicates that it is recommended to recite Qaaf or part of it in every khutbah. End quote. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would recite this soorah in large gatherings, such as Eid and Jumu‘ah, because it includes mention of the beginning of creation, the resurrection, the standing and the reckoning, paradise and hell, reward and punishment, encouragement and deterrent. End quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer (7/367). 3- Imam Ahmad (16982) narrated from Waathilah ibn al-Asqa‘ that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given instead of the Tawraat the seven [long soorahs], and I have been given instead of the Zaboor the soorahs that contain more than a hundred verses, and I have been given instead of the Injeel the seven oft-repeated verses, and I have been favoured with al-mufassal.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (1480). Soorat Qaaf is the beginning of al-Mufassal, as was stated by Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Tafseer (7/392). See the answer to question no. 143301 . 4- Muslim (458) narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite in Fajr {Qaf. Wa’l-Qur’an il-majeed} [Soorat Qaf], and the rest of his prayers were short. According to another report narrated by him: He used to recite in Fajr {Qaf. Wa’l-Qur’an il-majeed} [Soorat Qaf] and similar soorahs. 5- Az-Zayla‘i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Takhreej Ahaadeeth al-Kashshaaf (3/361) that ath-Tha‘labi narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b, from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “Whoever recites Soorat Qaaf, Allah will make easy for him the throes of death.” But this is one of the fabricated hadiths that were narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka‘b (may Allah be pleased with him) regarding the virtues of soorahs, and the scholars are unanimously agreed that it is a false hadith that is entirely fabricated. Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Abu Ishaaq ath-Tha‘labi narrated similar hadiths in his Tafseer, and he mentioned for each soorah a virtue, and Abu’l-Hasan al-Waahidi followed him in that. End quote. See: al-Mawdoo‘aat by Ibn al-Jawzi (1/240). For more information, please see the answer to question no. 47618 . And Allah knows best."
Giving charity in the last ten days of Ramadan,"Question Is it better to give in charity in the last ten days of Ramadan, or to spend the nights of those days in prayer and dhikr which is the only special thing about those nights?.","Praise be to Allah.What was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning staying up at night during the last ten nights of Ramadan is that those nights should be spent in prayer and dhikr. Charity during Ramadan is better than charity at other times, but we do not know of anything in the Sunnah to indicate that giving charity in the last ten days is better. But the scholars stated that righteous deeds are better when done at times of virtue, and undoubtedly the last ten nights of Ramadan are better than any other nights, because Laylat al-Qadr is among them, which is better than a thousand months. Whatever the case, what is prescribed for the Muslim is to give a great deal of charity throughout Ramadan. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most generous of people and he was at his most generous during Ramadan. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6; Muslim, 2308 And Allah knows best."
Are hasanaat and sayi’aat multiplied at special times and in special places?,Question Is it true that sayi’aat (bad deeds) are multiplied in Ramadaan? Is the same true of hasanaat (good deeds)? Is there any evidence to that effect?.,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, both hasanaat and sayi’aat are multiplied at special times and in special places, but there is a difference between the multiplication of hasanaat and the multiplication of sayi’aat. The multiplication of hasanaat is in both quantity and quality. What is meant by quantity is number, so a good deed is multiplied by ten times the like thereof; and what is meant by quality is that the reward is great and vast. With regard to sayi’aat, it is multiplied in terms of quality only, i.e., the sin is greater and the punishment is more severe. With regard to quantity a bad deed receives one sayi’ah, and it cannot be more than one. It says in Mataalib Uli al-Nuha (2/385): “Hasanaat and sayi’aat are multiplied in a special place such as Makkah, Madeenah and Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and in the mosques; and at special times such as on Fridays, during the sacred months and in Ramadaan. With regard to the multiplication of hasanaat, this is a matter concerning which there is no scholarly difference of opinion. With regard to the multiplication of sayi’aat, this was the view of a number of scholars, following Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood… Some scholars said that what Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood meant by the view on the multiplication of sayi’aat is that they are multiplied in quality but not in quantity.” Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Does fasting bring the Muslim expiation for both minor and major sins? Is the sin of an evil action compounded in Ramadaan?” He replied: “What is prescribed for the Muslim in Ramadaan and at other times is to strive against his nafs (self) that is inclined towards evil until it becomes tranquil and inclined towards goodness. He must fight against the enemy of Allaah Iblees until he is safe from his evil and his whispers. The Muslim in this world is engaged in a great, ongoing struggle against his nafs, his desires and the Shaytaan. So he has to repent a great deal and pray for forgiveness at all times. But times vary one from another. The month of Ramadaan is the best month of the year, for it is the month of forgiveness, mercy and ransom from the Fire. If the month is special and the place is special, the hasanaat for good deeds are multiplied and the sayi’aat for sins are multiplied. An evil deed done in Ramadaan is more sinful than one done at any other time, just as an act of worship done in Ramadaan brings a greater reward from Allaah than one done at any other time. Because Ramadaan has such a great status, an act of worship done during this month is especially virtuous and its reward is greatly multiplied, and a sin committed during this month is worse and more serious than a sin committed at any other time. So the Muslim has to make the most of this blessed month by doing acts of worship and righteous deeds, and giving up bad deeds, so that Allaah may bless him by accepting his good deeds and helping to remain steadfast in adhering to the truth. But a bad deed receives one sayi’ah like it, and is not multiplied in terms of quantity either in Ramadaan or at other times. But a good deed may be multiplied ten or more times, because Allaah says in Soorat al-An’aam (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever brings a good deed (Islamic Monotheism and deeds of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger) shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed (polytheism, disbelief, hypocrisy, and deeds of disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger) shall have only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not be wronged” [al-An’aam 6:160] And there are many similar verses. Similarly in special places such as the Haramayn [the Two Sanctuaries, i.e., in Makkah and Madeenah] deeds are multiplied greatly in quantity and quality; bad deeds are not multiplied in quantity but they are multiplied in quality when done at special times or in special places, as referred to above. And Allaah is the Source of strength. From Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah, 15/446. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/262: Both hasanaat and sayi’aat are multiplied when done in special places and at special times. Hasanaat (good deeds) are multiplied in quantity and quality; sayi’aat (bad deeds) are multiplied in quality but not in quantity, because Allaah says in Soorat al-An’aam, which was revealed in Makkah, (interpretation of the meaning): “Whoever brings a good deed (Islamic Monotheism and deeds of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger) shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed (polytheism, disbelief, hypocrisy, and deeds of disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger) shall have only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not be wronged” [al-An’aam 6:160] And He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and whoever inclines to evil actions therein [i.e., in al-Masjid al-Haraam in Makkah] or to do wrong (i.e. practise polytheism and leave Islamic Monotheism), him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment” [al-Hajj 22:25] But He did not say, We will multiply that to him, rather He said, “We shall cause to taste from a painful torment”. So the way in which sayi’aat done in Makkah or in Madeenah are multiplied is in terms of quality. And Allaah knows best."
Spending on relatives,Question When is it obligatory for a person to spend on his parents?,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle in spending on relatives such as parents and children is to be found in the Qur’aan, Sunnah and scholarly consensus. With regard to the Qur’aan, it is the aayat (interpretation of the meanings): “but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis” [al-Baqarah 2:233] “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents” [al-Isra’ 17:23] Duty towards parents includes spending on them according to necessity. With regard to ijmaa’ (scholarly consensus), Ibn al-Mundhir said: “The scholars are agreed that spending on poor parents who have no source of income and no money is an obligation on the son’s wealth.” The obligation of spending is conditional upon the one who is spending being able to afford to do so, and upon the one on whom money is spent being in difficulty and being in need of that spending. This is according to general consensus."
He wants to propose marriage to a girl whose father puts his money in the bank,"Question I am intending to propose marriage to a girl, but I found out that her father puts his money in the bank and he is going to prepare her trousseau using this money. Will this trousseau and furniture be halaal or haraam?.","Praise be to Allah. Consuming riba is a major sin and one of the serious sins that incur punishment. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. 279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [al-Baqarah 2:278-279] And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same. Narrated by Muslim 1598. But dealing with a person who consumes riba is permissible. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) dealt with the Jews although they consumed riba. What is haraam with regard to the wealth of one who consumes riba is the extra money obtained through riba only; the rest of his wealth -- if it is from a halaal source -- is halaal. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about those whose wealth is mostly haraam such as tax collectors (referring to the maks, a haraam levy or tax), those who consume riba and so on, as well as those who practice haraam professions such as those who make images of animate beings, astrologers and the helpers of oppressive rulers. Is it permissible to buy food from them or not? He replied: If their wealth consists of both halaal and haraam, then dealing with them is a grey area; it cannot be ruled to be haraam unless it is known that he is giving him something that it is haraam to give, and it cannot be ruled to be halaal unless it is known that he is giving him something halaal. If most of it is halaal, then it cannot be ruled that it is haraam to interact with him; if most of it is haraam, it was said that it is halaal to interact with him and it was said that rather it is haraam. With regard to the one who deals with riba, the majority of his wealth may be halaal, unless it is known that it is not halaal for some other reason. That is because when he sells 1000 for 1200, it is only the additional amount that is haraam. If his wealth consists of both halaal and haraam and they are mixed, the halaal part of it cannot be ruled to be haraam; rather he may take the proportion that is halaal, as in the case where there are two partners and the wealth of one of them is mixed with the wealth of the other, then it should be divided between the two partners. The same applies with regard to the one whose wealth is mixed between halaal and haraam; the portion that is haraam should be taken out and the rest is halaal for him. And Allah knows best. End quote. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 29/272-273 Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) favoured the view that wealth that is acquired by haraam means, such as riba, earnings of a female singer, selling drugs and bribes is only haraam for the one who acquires it; as for the one who takes it from him for a permissible reason, such as if he spends it on his children and his wife, or on a gift or payment for work and so on, it is halaal for the one who takes it. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Everything that is acquired by haraam means is haraam and does not benefit the one who acquired it, and if he spends it he will not be blessed in it and if he gives it in charity it will not be accepted from him, and if he leaves it behind, it will be his provision for the Hell fire. But with regard to the one to whom he gives that thing, it is not haraam for him, because the prohibition is connected to the way in which it was acquired, not to the wealth itself. Everything that is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired is only haraam for the one who acquired it in that way, but for the one who takes it by permissible means from the one who acquired it, it is not haraam for him. But as for that which is haraam in and of itself [such as stolen wealth or wealth acquired by force], it is haraam both for the one who acquires it and for others. End quote. Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb, 13/179 He also said: There is nothing wrong with a person accepting zakaah or donations from riba-based banks, because he is receiving it by lawful means, and the sin is on the bank for acquiring it by means of riba. The evidence for that is the fact that the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted gifts from the Jews and he accepted invitations from the Jews, although it is well known that the Jews consumed riba and acquired wealth by unlawful means. Similarly he interacted with the Jews in Khaybar, i.e., he gave them some of the palm trees and crops on the basis that they would have half and the Muslims would have half, although it was well known that they consumed riba. Hence you may follow a useful principle: If someone acquires something by any permissible means then the sin of the one who acquired it by haraam means is not passed to him, because it is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired, so it is haraam for the one who acquired it in an inappropriate manner. But if you know that this wealth is the property of so and so, such as if a thief stole a sheep and brought it to you as a gift, then it is not permissible for you to accept it from him, because you know that this sheep belongs to So and so. But if something is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired, it is permissible for the one who takes it by lawful means. End quote. Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 27/140 Based on that, there is nothing wrong with proposing marriage to this girl, if she is religiously committed and of good character, and it does not matter that her father puts his money in riba-based banks and will supply his daughter’s trousseau from this wealth. The sin of that haraam wealth is on her father only, and there is no sin on her or on you because of that, in sha Allah. You have to advise her father and tell him not to do this evil thing; you should explain that riba is devoid of blessing and it will be a cause of loss and shame on the Day of Resurrection.

She did not make up the Ramadaan fasts that she owed for nine years,"Question I am a girl who was astray but praise be to Allaah I have been guided. But my question is that I used to fast Ramadaan, but I did not make up the fasts I owed for nine years. There are about 50 days and I cannot fast all of them. I can do half of them and I will give money for the rest of them. Is that permissible? How much should I give?.","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: for having guided you and enabled you to do that which He loves. We give glad tidings to you of the forgiveness of Allaah, for the one who repents from sin is like one who has not sinned at all. And whoever turns to Allaah, Allaah will turn to Him. Secondly: Those who break the fast in Ramadaan for a legitimate shar’i excuse, such as travellers, those who are sick and menstruating women have to make up the days when they did not fast, if they are able to fast. It is not permissible to feed poor people instead when one is able to fast, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:185] i.e., he must fast the number of days that he missed. It was narrated that Mu’aadhah said: I asked ‘Aa’ishah: “Why does the menstruating woman have to make up the fasts and not the prayers?” She said: “That used to happen to us, and we were commanded to make up the fasts but we were not commanded to make up the prayers.” Narrated by Muslim, 335. Thirdly: It is not obligatory for you to fast them one after the other; you can fast them separately, so fast one day and not the next, or fast a number of consecutive days then do not fast for a number of days, and so on… according what is easiest for you, until Allaah enables you to make up all the days you owe. You should start by making up the days missed in Ramadaan of last year, so that the next Ramadan will not start before you have fasted them. See question no. 26865, for it is important. Seek the help of Allaah and ask Him to help you to obey Him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say in his du’aa’: “O Allaah, help me to remember You, be thankful to You and worship You well.” May Allaah help you to do all that is good. And Allaah knows best."
White Day Fasting: Lunar or Solar Calendar?,"Question I am a ""New"" Muslim (or recently converted) and I thank Allah for guiding me to this truly happiest move I've made in my life. Among all the other ways to worship the Allah, I appreciate very much the issue of fasting. I have truly enjoyed my first Ramadan this year and went through all 30 days with pride and great faith. I'm also very interested in voluntary fasting and besides fasting Thursdays, I've been also fasting during the White Days (13,14,15 every month). However, I've realized that I've been fasting 13,14,15 according to Georgian, normal calendar, and not according to an Islamic one! Is what I have done really wrong? Does it annul my fasting? What shall I do in the future? Thank you very much in advance!","Praise be to Allah.First of all, congratulations on the blessing of Allah which you have received, as He has guided you to this religion and caused you to enjoy the sweetness of obedience and worship through fasting, which is one of the greatest forms of worship. Here we will explain in brief the virtues of fasting. Virtues of fasting The virtues of fasting are immense, and a number of sound hadiths state this, such as the following: Fasting is something which is just for Allah, and Allah will give multiple rewards without measure for it. The hadith says: [Allah says:] Fasting is Mine and it is I Who give reward for it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1904) There is nothing equivalent to fasting. (Al-Nasai, 4/165; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/413) The supplication (du’a) of the fasting person will not be refused. (Reported by al-Bayhaqi, 3/345; see also al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 1797) The one who fasts has two joys: the joy of breaking his fast and, when he meets his Lord, the joy of having fasted. (Reported by Muslim, 2/807) Fasting will be an intercession for the slave on the Day of Resurrection, when it will say: O Lord, I stopped him from eating and drinking during the day, so let me intercede for him. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/174; al-Bayhaqi classed its isnad as hasan in al-Mujtama, 3/181; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411) The smell (coming from the mouth of) the fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the scent of musk. (Muslim, 2/808). Fasting is a protection and a strong fortress against the Fire. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/402; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411 and Sahih al-Jami’, 3880) Whoever fasts one day for the sake of Allah, Allah will keep his face seventy years distance away from the Fire because of it. (Reported by Muslim, 2/808) Whoever fasts a day seeking the pleasure of Allah and then dies [i.e. that is the last thing he does] will enter Paradise. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/391; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/412) In Paradise, there is a gate called al-Rayyan, through which those who fast will enter, and no-one else will enter through it. After they have entered, it will be locked and no-one else will enter it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1797). Voluntary fasts will make up for any shortfall in obligatory fasts. Examples of voluntary fasts include ‘Ashura , the Day of ‘Arafah , al-Ayam al-Bid (the White Days), Mondays and Thursdays , six days of Shawwal , and increased fasting during the months of al-Muharram and Sha’ban. What are the White Days? What is meant by al-Ayyam al-Bid is the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each lunar month, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.” [al-Baqarah 2:189] So the timing of certain acts of worship and the ‘iddah (waiting period for women who have been divorced or widowed, etc.) are worked out according to the lunar months of the Hijri or Islamic calendar, not the solar months of the Gregorian or Western calendar. The fasts which you have observed according to the solar calendar most likely do not correspond with the lunar calendar, but in any case you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for the days that you have fasted, because you have fasted them voluntarily for the sake of Allah. But if you wish to earn the reward that is specifically for fasting Ayyam al-Bid, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do, you should find out the timings according to the lunar calendar and fast according to it. We ask Allah to increase His blessings upon you, to help you adhere to His religion, to give you the strength to do that which will please Him and to increase your reward, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. Do not forget us in your prayers whilst you are fasting. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
He married a Christian girl in the presence of her kaafir brother,"Question I made zeena with a christian girl and she became pregnant.In my ignorance,I thought I would make the situation right and marry her.We were married in the masjid with the imam,another muslim brother,her brother and her mother as witness.She was not muslim at the time of our marriage.She did later take shahadah before our child was born.What is the status of our marriage?What is the status of this child?What is the status of my other children by her?I have regret and remorse of what I did and I do not want go back to this,but I am concerned that my marriage is not even legal,in which case I would find myself in the same sin.What do I do to relieve myself of the predicament I have gotten myself into?","Praise be to Allah.This marriage is considered to be null and void, because it happened when she was pregnant as a result of zinaa, and because it was lacking in one of the essential conditions of marriage, which is the presence of two male witnesses and the acceptance of her guardian. On this basis, the marriage contract must be repeated with a Muslim walee (guardian) or qaadi (judge). The children should be named after the father on whose bed they were born and the father should not disown any one of them, because “the child is for the bed.” And Allaah knows best."
Studying in a society that does not adhere to Islamic sharee’ah,"Question I am a young Muslim man. I worship Allaah and I want to act in accordance with the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But the problem is that I live among people most of whom do not pray or fast or pay zakaah. They engage in bid’ah and innovated matters, they swear by things other than Allaah and make vows to others than Allaah. Some people express disbelief (kufr) in Allaah and His Messenger in their words. I am a youth studying in middle school, and most of the students are bad mannered and do not obey the commands of Allaah. There are girls with us who do not wear hijaab, and the female teachers are the same, so that it is too easy to commit evil and haraam actions, and other things that would take too long to explain. But my father will not let me leave school. I want to leave this school and get away from this environment, and work in farming and worship Allaah far away from the evil of people, but my father will not let me do that. I want to ask whether it is permissible for me to leave school. Is it permissible for me to leave this country and move to another, even if my father does not approve? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.","Praise be to Allah.If the situation is as you describe, then you must leave this school and beware of its evil, and keep away from it and its people, in order to protect your religious commitment, belief and morals from these evildoers among the students, male and female, and this bad society. You must do your utmost to move to a safe school or a safe city or a farm or whatever is farthest removed from danger to your religious commitment and morals. This is what you must do, even if your father does not approve, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Obedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said, “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.” Sitting among evildoers, people of shirk and those who do not pray, and sitting among girls who make a wanton display of their beauty and are unveiled poses a serious danger to one's beliefs and morals, so it is not permissible for the Muslim to remain in this situation. Rather he must beware of this society and move away from it to a society that is better and safer for his religious commitment even if he has to travel from one city to another, such as going to Makkah or Madeenah in order to study in al-Masjid al-Haraam or al-Masjid al-Nabawi, because there are teachers there who are people of knowledge, virtue and sound ‘aqeedah, whether his parents approve or not, because obedience to parents is only with regard to that which is right and proper, not in matters of sin and disobedience, as stated above. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek."
Is it permissible for him to buy a computer for his son using interest he has received or keep it in return for waiving debts owed to him?,"Question I want to get rid of some interest. Is it permissible for me to (i) give it to my son who is a university student aged 22 and he does not have any income except what his father spends on his maintenance for food and drink and the like? Is it permissible for me to give him some of this interest so that he can buy a computer and other things that will help him in his studies?; or (ii) to give it to my siblings who are hard up? Is it permissible for me to keep some of this interest in return for loans that I had lent and that they did not give back to me, and to let them off?.","Praise be to Allah. Firstly: It is haraam to deal with riba in all forms and this is a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. 279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [al-Baqarah 2:278-279] It is essential to repent from it by giving up the sin, regretting what has happened in the past, resolving not to do it again and giving up the haraam money by spending it on charitable causes and in the public interest. The penitent does not have the right to benefit from it by using it in his own interests, such as buying food or drink or accommodation or spending it on his family or education fees, or on warding off harm or injustice from himself, such as paying the costs of compulsory insurance or any other kinds of taxes and levies. Based on that, you do not have the right to spend from this riba on obligatory maintenance of your son, such as his food and drink or the costs of his education. With regard to buying the equipment that he is unable to buy and which is not included in the obligatory maintenance, it seems that this is permissible, and it is also permissible to pay off his debts, because the father is not obliged to pay off the debts of his son. Secondly: It is permissible to give this interest to a poor brother if his maintenance is not obligatory upon you. See the discussion of that in the answer to question number 81952. Thirdly: It is not permissible for you to take this interest in return for waiving debts that are owed to you, because there are benefits for you in that and it is in your interests, because debts may be paid off or the debtor may not be able to pay it. It has been stated above that the penitent is not entitled to benefit from the interest. But you can give it to these debtors, and if they use it to pay off the debts that they owe to you, there is nothing wrong with your accepting it. We ask Allaah to forgive your sins and to accept your repentance. And Allaah knows best."
Ruling on keeping dolls and computer games in which the player dresses dolls,"Question I have several questions: 1. I really like playing games in which I dress dolls, because they teach me how to choose my outfits and choose their colours. Is there any sin on me, and what is the ruling on that? 2. I love to draw, especially anime, but I separate the head from the bodies. Is that haraam? 3. I take answers for the questions in my textbooks from the Internet. Is this haraam, knowing that the teacher knows about it? 4. What is the ruling on watching cartoons without music, but the girl characters wear athletic clothes? These cartoons are shown on the Majd children’s channel. 5. What is the ruling on wearing the burqa‘ (niqab) with the extra cover, meaning that no one can see my eyes?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: There is nothing wrong with keeping dolls in the house, on condition that they belong to small children, because they serve the purpose of entertaining, training and teaching the children. Please see the answers to questions no. 20325 and 119056 . This has to do with dolls made of plastic or cloth, which usually help little girls to train to do their future tasks as mothers, such as combing their hair, dressing them in modest clothes, and other things that are well known in the world of children. As for the games which involve dressing dolls, as mentioned in the question, the ruling on that is different. After looking at the websites to which the questioner referred, we found that they involve clear evils and obvious sins, which guarantees that it is haraam to visit those websites and play these doll-dressing games. The reasons for this prohibition include the following: 1.. These games for girls are not the kind of games that are exempted according to Islamic teachings from the general prohibition on images; rather these are images of animate beings, whether they are drawn by hand or with the computer. The point here is that they are images of animate beings, which it is prohibited to draw. For more information on this prohibition, please see the answers to questions no. 34839 , 10668 and 39806 . 2.. There are some serious problems with these images, as they show the images of semi-naked girls, so that the player can choose the right clothes for them. Such alluring images are undoubtedly haraam, because they are spreading immorality and evil. The girl may admire these bodies and underwear, and try to imitate them, which may lead to many bad consequences. 3. These games include images which encourage immorality and unlawful relationships, as the players are asked to choose clothing that is suitable for young men and women to go out together on a first date, or to matchmake for marriage. This is wrong, and it is not permissible to allow it because of the evils that it involves. Allowing it means approving of unlawful relationships between young men and women, and encouraging them to do such things in real life, and it takes away the modesty and shyness of young girls and makes them get used to evil. For these reasons, the ruling on visiting such websites is that it is haraam. Secondly: Anime, which is short for “animation,” is a type of cartoon. What the question is about is the ruling on drawing images of the heroes of these cartoons, such as Tom (who is the cat) and Jerry (who is the mouse), without showing their heads. The answer to that is: When it comes to drawing things, everything is either animate, such as humans and animals, or inanimate, such as trees and rivers. If the drawing is of the second type, then there is nothing wrong with it. But if the drawing is of animate beings – which includes the heroes of cartoons – then the basic principle is that it is haraam, but if the drawing is without a head, then what appears to be the case is that it is permissible. For information on the ruling on drawing animate beings, please see the answers to questions no. 7222 and 98424 . Thirdly: There is nothing wrong with taking the answers to questions in textbooks from the Internet or other sources, because this is a type of studying and learning. Fourthly: There is nothing wrong with watching cartoons, on condition that they adhere to Islamic guidelines. This has been discussed previously in the answer to question no. 97444. Fifthly: The niqab or burqa‘ is prescribed according to Islamic teachings, but some women are careless about adhering to the conditions of wearing it, which has led some of our contemporary scholars to disallow women to wear it. For the one who adheres to the conditions of wearing it, there is nothing wrong with her wearing it, if Allah wills. This has been discussed previously in the answers to questions no. 1496 and 21134 . And Allah knows best."
Ruling on playing with ouija boards,"Question I recently found out about a game that is very common in our country, which is called Ouija. Does this game come under the heading of witchcraft and interacting with the jinn?","Praise be to Allah. The ouija board game poses a danger to the religious commitment and life of the player. With regard to his religious commitment, that is because it involves calling upon and addressing the jinn, responding to them, believing their words, and being afraid of going against their orders. The ruling on playing this game is no different than the ruling on going to fortune tellers and soothsayers, because of what happens of the player asking the jinn about matters that are unseen or unknown to him. With regard to the danger that it poses to his life, that is because of what has happened of many people being affected by mental illness, anxiety and fear that ruined their lives. Hence there have been many statements from psychologists and there is unanimous agreement on the necessity of getting rid of this game and not trying it out, let alone playing it and becoming attached to it. In brief, it consists of a board on which are written all the numbers and letters, and at the top of the board are written the words Yes, No, and Goodbye. Each board is written in the language of the local people and there is a disc in the middle of the board, the edges of which are held by a minimum of two players. The game begins by calling upon “Ouija”, and it is clear in the minds of the players that they are now calling upon a spirit or a jinn, according to the player’s belief, and he is asked about things that are unknown to them of events that have taken place, and the disc moves towards the numbers and letters in order to spell out the answer to the question. If the question is about a specific date, the disc, with their fingers on it, moves towards the numbers in order to answer the question. Similarly, if the question is about a name or an event, then the disc moves towards the letters in order to spell out the answer to the question. Or the answer may be Yes or No, so the disc moves towards one of them. The players cannot choose to exit the game until they ask permission from “Ouija”, then if the disk moves towards the word No, they cannot leave the game, but if it moves towards the word Yes, then they can leave, whereupon they have to thank him, then when the players have thanked him, the disc moves towards the word Goodbye. Some people try to take the matter lightly and make it merely a game for fun, but in fact it is extremely serious. What appears to be the case is that the word “Ouija” is the name of one of the jinn – a king or someone else– and he sends one of his troops to move the disk towards the numbers and letters to spell out the answers. There are some people who believe that this movement comes from the devil-companions (qareen) of the players, and that what they ask about is known to them only or is known in the realm of the jinn. There are others – Western doctors and scientists – who believe that the phenomenon of the disk’s movement is what is called “unconscious movement”; what is meant is that the mind is able, under the influence of certain emotions, to move the muscles of the body unconsciously, without the individual being aware of this movement, so it appears to him as if the spirits are moving the pointer under his hand. What is established in the mind of the Muslim is that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade going to soothsayers and said that “they are nothing.” And he said that if a person goes to them, even if he does not believe in them, then no prayer will be accepted from him for forty days, and that whoever goes to them and believes in them has committed an act of disbelief. We have discussed all of this – with the relevant evidence – in the answers to questions no. 8291, 60431, 100900 and 135589. It is not permissible for the Muslim to seek the help of the jinn to find out unknown and unseen matters, even if he does not seek to draw close to them by doing acts of worship or obedience to them. Merely seeking their help is prohibited. See the answer to question no. 137948. Because the jinn benefit from the humans who play this game, the jinn submit, in a sense, to the players, by telling them the unknown matters they ask about. The human also submits to the jinn in a sense. It is sufficient to note that they dare not leave the game without seeking the permission of “Ouija”, otherwise they think and believe that they will be harmed. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): ‘O you assembly of jinns! Many did you mislead of men,’ and their Auliya (friends and helpers, etc.) amongst men will say: ‘Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us’” [al-An‘aam 6:128]. The sin and disbelief that affect the player before and during the game, and afterwards, is what Allah, may He be exalted, mentions in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the jinns, but they (jinns) increased them (mankind) in sin and disbelief” [al-Jinn 72:6]. With regard to the ruling on seeking the help of the jinn, please see the answers to questions no. 10815, 11114 and 78546. Conclusion: It is haraam for the Muslim to play the Ouija board game, even if in fact it involves no more than unconscious movements, because the player actually and intentionally calls upon the jinn, which comes under the heading of seeking the help of the jinn and the ruling on going to fortune tellers and soothsayers. All of these are haraam things. We have discussed this above and in the answers referred to. And Allah knows best."
Can We Talk during I’tikaf?,Question Is it true that one should not talk to others during i’tikaf?,"Praise be to Allah.The purpose of i’tikaf I’tikaf means staying in the mosque to worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. The purpose of i’tikaf is for the individual to devote his time to worshipping Allah, may He be exalted, far removed from everything that may distract him. Therefore the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to observe i’tikaf in a small tent inside the mosque, so that this place would be only for the person who was observing i’tikaf and he would not be distracted by other people in the mosque, as he could not see them and they could not see him. Can we talk to others during i’tikaf? This is what the person who is observing i’tikaf should be keen to do, but if he speaks briefly to some of the people, or someone comes to visit him and he talks to him, there is nothing wrong with that. But this conversation should be in a low voice, so as not to distract any of those who are remembering Allah, may He be exalted, reading Quran or praying in the mosque. And this talk should be brief and should not distract him from the purpose of i’tikaf. Can a woman talk to her husband during i’tikaf? Al-Bukhari (2035) and Muslim (2175) narrated from ‘Ali ibn Husayn that Safiyyah – the wife of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – told him that she came to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to visit him when he was in i’tikaf in the mosque during the last ten days of Ramadan , and she spoke to him for a while, then she got up to leave, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) got up with her. Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Ihkam (2/45): “This hadith indicates that it is permissible for a woman to visit the one who is in i’tikaf and it is permissible to talk to the one who is in i’tikaf.” What should be done during i’tikaf and should not be done? Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The deeds of the one who is in i’tikaf may be divided into several categories: those that are permissible, those that are prescribed and encouraged, and those that are prohibited. As for those that are prescribed, he should focus on worshipping Allah and seeking to draw closer to Him, because this is the essence and purpose of i’tikaf. Therefore it is limited to the mosques (and cannot be done elsewhere). Another category is that which is prohibited, which refers to anything that is contrary to i’tikaf, such as if the person was to go outside of the mosque with no excuse, or to buy or sell, or to have intercourse with his wife, and other deeds that would cancel out i’tikaf because they are contrary to its purpose. The third category is that which is permissible and allowed, such as talking to people , asking them how they are and other things that Allah, may He be exalted, has permitted to the one who is observing i’tikaf. (Majmu‘ Fatawa wa Rasail al-‘Uthaymin, 20/175-176) He also said: “There is nothing wrong with him talking briefly to his companions who are with him in i’tikaf or who have come in to visit him.” (Jalasat Ramadaniyyah, 18/15) He also said: “I’tikaf: is what is meant thereby that some friends get together in a corner of the mosque to talk about unimportant matters and that in which there is no benefit, or is the purpose to devote oneself to worshipping Allah, may He be glorified and exalted? The latter is the purpose of it, so beware of wasting this precious time in talking to your friends and wasting time. But if you talk to them sometimes, there is nothing wrong with that, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) talked to his wife Safiyyah bint Huyayy (may Allah be pleased with her) at night, then he got up to walk her back to her house.” (Al-Liqa ash-Shahri, 70/8) Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to talking in the mosque, if it is about worldly matters and is a conversation between brothers and friends about some of their worldly concerns, if it is brief then there is nothing wrong with it, in sha Allah, but if it goes on at length then it is makruh. It is makruh to take the mosques as places for talking about worldly matters , because they were built for the remembrance of Allah, reading Quran, offering the five daily prayers and other good deeds, such as offering supererogatory prayers, observing i’tikaf and holding study circles. But with regard to taking them as places to chat about worldly matters, that is makruh, but a little of that, if necessary, when greeting one’s brother with salam when meeting him, and asking him how he and his children are, and so on, or talking about worldly matters, so long as that does not go on at length and is done briefly, there is nothing wrong with that.” (Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb, 2/706) For more, please see this category: I’tikaf. And Allah knows best."
Ruling on the farewell tawaaf for the disabled and for menstruating women,"Question Do menstruating women, women bleeding following childbirth, disabled people and sick people have to do the farewell tawaaf?.","Praise be to Allah.Menstruating woman and women who are bleeding following childbirth do not have to do the farewell tawaaf. The disabled should do it, carried by others, as should those who are sick, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you should leave until the last thing that he does is to circumambulate the House.” And it was narrated in al-Saheehayn that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told the people that the last thing they should do in Makkah was to circumambulate the Ka’bah, but he exempted menstruating women. Another hadeeth indicates that women who are bleeding following childbirth (nifaas) are like menstruating women and do not have to do the farewell tawaaf."
How a woman should wipe her head when doing wudoo’,Question What is the way in which a woman should wipe her head when doing wudoo’?.,"Praise be to Allah.The way in which a woman – and a man whose hair is long – should wipe the head when doing wudoo’ is what is narrated in the hadeeth of al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh (may Allaah be pleased with her). Ahmad (26484) and Abu Dawood (128) narrated from her that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did wudoo’ in her house, and he wiped his entire head from the crown of the head, all the way to the back of the head, and he did not disturb or ruffle the hair. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. What is meant by the “crown of the head” is the top of the head, i.e., start wiping from top to bottom. Al-‘Iraaqi said: What is meant is that he would start wiping from the top of the head to the bottom, and he did that on each side. End quote from ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. Another well known way of wiping has also been narrated, which is to wipe the hair with both hands from front to back, then to bring the hands back to the place where one started. But this method leads to ruffling the hair, and the preferred method for women is to wipe the head in the first manner, or to wipe from the front to the back of the head and not to bring the hands back again. This is another interpretation of the hadeeth of al-Rubayyi’. See the answer to question no. 45867. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/87): If the one who has hair fears that it may be ruffled if he brings his hands back over his head, then he may not do that. This was stated by Ahmad. It was said to him: How should the one who has hair down to his shoulders wipe (his head) during wudoo’? He wiped his head once and said: Like this, so as to avoid ruffling his hair, i.e., he should pass his hands to the back of his head and not bring them forward again. If he wishes he may wipe his head, as it was narrated from al-Rubayyi’ that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did wudoo’ in her house, and he wiped his entire head from the parting on each side to the back, and he did not disturb or ruffle the hair. Narrated by Abu Dawood. Ahmad was asked: How should a woman wipe her hair? He said: Like this; and he put his hand in the middle of his head, then drew it forwards, then he lifted it and put it where he had started, then he drew it backwards. Whatever he wipes it after wiping what is obligatory is good enough. End quote. And Allaah knows best."
Sex-change operations,Question Is it permitted for a person to change his sex from a woman to a man or vice versa? Please give evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnaah.,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a person to change sex from male to female or vice versa. The Muslim has to be content with what Allaah has decreed, for He has placed him in a suitable position. He does not know – perhaps if he was female that would not be good for him, or if she was male that would be bad for her. Similarly, there are some people for whom nothing but poverty is good, and if Allaah made such a person rich it would be harmful for him; and there are others for whom nothing but richness is appropriate, and if they became poor that would be harmful to them. Some women wished that they could be men who would fight in the way of Allaah. This was just wishful thinking, but Allaah revealed the prohibition of that wishful thinking in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And wish not for the things in which Allaah has made some of you to excel others. For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned” [al-Nisaa’ 4:32] If mere wishful thinking is forbidden, then how about taking action based on that? If the Muslim is forbidden to change the creation of Allaah in minor cases, so how about changing sex altogether? Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr Changing one’s sex is a kind of tampering with the creation of Allaah and following the way of the Shaytaan who vowed that he would misguide the sons of Adam in this way and in others, as Allaah tells us that he said: “and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah” [al-Nisaa’ 4:119 – interpretation of the meaning] We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound."
Etiquette of travelling to Hajj and elsewhere,"Question Is there a particular etiquette that the traveller should pay attention to, especially when travelling to Hajj?.","Praise be to Allah.There are many points of etiquette to be followed by the traveller, which the scholars have compiled. One of those who compiled these rulings well was al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), in his book al-Majmoo’ (4/264-287), where he mentions sixty-two points of etiquette. We will mention some of them in brief, and anyone who wants to know more may consult the writings of al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him). He said: Chapter on the etiquette of travelling: This is an important topic, for which there is a great need. Our aim here is to refer to this etiquette in brief. 1 – When a person wants to travel, it is mustahabb for him to consult those whose religious commitment, experience and knowledge he trusts about travelling at that time. The one who is consulted must be sincere in offering advice and avoid being influenced by whims and desires. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and consult them in the affairs” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:159] The saheeh ahaadeeth indicate that the people used to consult the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with regard to their affairs. 2 – Once he has decided to travel, the Sunnah is to seek Allah’s guidance by praying istikhaarah. So he should pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then recite the du`a of istikhaarah. 3 – If he has decided to travel for Hajj or jihad or any other purpose, he should start by repenting from all sins and makrooh actions, and he should put right any wrongs he has done towards people and pay off whatever he can of the debts he owes them; he should also return anything that has been entrusted to him and seek forgiveness from anyone with whom he has any dealings or friendship. He should write his will and have it witnessed, and he should appoint someone to pay off the debts that he was not able to pay. He should also leave with his family and those on whom he is obliged to spend enough funds to cover their needs until he returns. 4 – He should seek to please his parents and those whom he is obliged to honour and obey. 5 – If he is travelling for Hajj or jihad or any other purpose, he should strive to ensure that his funds are halaal and free from any suspicion. If he goes against this and goes for Hajj or jihad with wealth that has been seized by force, he is a sinner and although his Hajj or jihad may be outwardly valid, it will not be a proper Hajj (Hajj mabroor). 6 – It is mustahabb for the one who is travelling to Hajj or for any other purpose for which provision is carried to take a great deal of provision and money with him, so that he can share them with those who are in need. His provisions should be good (i.e., halaal), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it” [al-Baqarah 2:267] He should give willingly so that it will be more likely to be accepted. 7 – If he wants to travel for Hajj or jihad, he should learn about how they are to be done, for no act of worship is valid if done by one who does not know it properly. It is mustahabb for the one who wants to do Hajj to take with him a clear book about the rituals which also speaks about their aims, and he should read it constantly and often throughout his journey, so that it will become fixed in his mind. Hence there is the fear that for some of the common folk, their Hajj will not be valid because they fail to fulfil one of the conditions and so on. And some of them may imitate some of the common folk of Makkah, thinking that they know the rituals properly and thus being deceived by them. That is a serious mistake. Similarly in the case of one who is going out for jihad etc, it is recommended for him to take a book which speaks of what he needs to know, and the warrior should learn what he needs to know about fighting and the du`as to be said at that time, and the prohibitions on treachery, killing women and children, and so on. The one who is travelling for the purpose of trade should learn what he needs to know about buying and selling, which transactions are valid and which are invalid, what is halaal and what is haraam, and so on. 8 – It is mustahabb for him to seek a companion who desires good and hates evil, so that if he forgets, he can remind him, if he remembers, he can help him, and if he happens to be a man of knowledge, he should stick with him, because he will help him to avoid bad attitudes such as boredom with travel and he can help him to maintain a noble attitude and encourage him to do so. He should also be keen to please his companion throughout the journey. Each of them should put up with the other and view his companion with respect, and be patient with whatever he may do at some times. 9 – It is mustahabb for him to bid farewell to his family, neighbours, friends and all his loved ones. He should bid them farewell and he should say to each of them: “I place your religion, your faithfulness and the ends of your deeds in the trust of Allah.” The one who is staying behind should say to the traveller: “May Allah bless you with taqwa and forgive you your sins and make goodness easy for you wherever you are.” 10 – It is Sunnah to say the following du`a when leaving the house: Bismillaah, tawakkaltu ‘ala Allah, wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah. Allahumma inni a’oodhu bika min an adilla aw udalla aw azilla aw uzalla aw azlima aw uzlama aw ajhala aw yujhal ‘alayya (In the name of Allah, I put my trust in Allah and there is no power and no strength except with Allah. O Allah, I seek refuge with You lest I should stray or be led astray, or slip or be tripped, or do wrong or be wronged, or behave foolishly or be treated foolishly).” 11 – The Sunnah when leaving one's house and wanting to get up on one's mount is to say Bismillah. Then when he has mounted it he should say: “Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi sakhkhara lana hadha wa ma kunna lahu muqrineen wa inna ila rabbina la munqaliboon (In the name of Allah… All praise be to Allah Who has placed this (transport) at our service and we ourselves would not have been capable of that, and to our Lord is our final destiny.” Then he should say Al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allah) three times and Allahu akbar (Allah is most Great) three times, then, “Subhaanaka inni zalamtu nafsi faghfir li innahu la yaghfir ul-dhunooba illa anta (Glory be to You, verily I have wronged myself, so forgive me, for surely no one can forgive sins except You).” And: “Allahumma inna nas’aluka fi safarina haadha al-birra wa’l-taqwa wa min al-‘aml ma tarda, Allahumma hawwin ‘alayna safarana haadha watwi ‘anna bu’dahu. Allahumma anta al-saahib fi’l-safar wa’l-khaleefah fi’l-ahl. Allahumma inni a’oodhu bika min wa’tha’ al-safar wa ka’aabat al-manzar wa su’ al-munqalib fi’l-maali wa’l-ahl (O Allah, we ask You for righteousness and piety in this journey of ours, and we ask You for deeds which please You. O Allah, facilitate our journey and let us cover its distance quickly. O Allah, You are the Companion on the journey and the Successor (the One Who guards them in a person’s absence) over the family. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the difficulties of travel, from having a change of heart and from being in a bad predicament, and I seek refuge with You from an ill-fated outcome with regard to wealth and family).” When returning the same words are recited with the following addition: “Aayiboona taa’iboona ‘aabidoona li rabbina haamidoon (Returning, repenting, worshipping and praising our Lord).” 12 – It is mustahabb to travel with a group of people, because of the hadith of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the people knew what I know about being alone, no one would ever travel alone at night.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. 13 – It is mustahabb for the group to appoint the best and wisest of their number as their leader, and to obey him, because of the hadith of Abu Sa’eed and Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When three people set out on a journey, let them appoint one of their number as their leader.” A hasan hadith narrated by Abu Dawood with a hasan isnaad. 14 – It is mustahabb to set out at the end of the night, because of the hadith of Anas who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You should travel at the end of the night (or throughout the night) because it is easier to cover a greater distance at night.” This was narrated by Abu Dawood with a hasan hadith. It was also narrated by al-Haakim who said: it is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 15 – He should adopt a kind and good attitude, and avoid arguing or pushing and shoving people on the road. He should guard his tongue against insults, backbiting, cursing his mount or any other kind of foul speech. 16 – It is mustahabb for the traveller to say takbeer when going up a rise in the land and to say tasbeeh when going down into valleys and the like. 17 – If he sees a village or town that he wants to enter, it is mustahabb for him to say: “Allahumma as’aluka khayraha wa khayra ahliha wa khayra ma fiha wa ‘a’oodhu bika min sharriha wa sharri ahliha wa sharri ma fiha (O Allah, I ask You for its goodness, the goodness of its people and the goodness of what is in it, and I seek refuge with You from its evil, the evil of its people and the evil of what is in it).” 18 – It is mustahabb for him to make du`a most of the time when travelling, because his du`a will be answered. He should try to remain in a state of purity and to pray on time. Allah has made it easy by allowing tayammum and joining and shortening of prayers. 20 – The Sunnah when stopping in a place is to say what was narrated by Khawlah bint Hakeem, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever makes a stop then says: ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allah il-taammati min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” Narrated by Muslim. 21 – It is mustahabb for a travelling group to camp close to one another and not to be scattered or separated needlessly, because of the hadith of Abu Tha’labah al-Khushani (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When the people stopped in a place, they would scatter in the mountain passes and valleys. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your scattering in these mountain passes and valleys is something from the Shaytaan.” After that, they never stopped in any place without being close together. Narrated by Abu Dawood with a hasan isnaad. 22 – The Sunnah for the traveller is that when he has done what he set out to do, he should hasten to return to his family, because of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Travel is a kind of torment, which keeps one of you from his food and drink. When one of you has finished what he set out to do, let him hasten back to his family.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 23 – The Sunnah is to say when returning from a journey that which is narrated in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar, according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he came back from a campaign or from Hajj and ‘Umrah, he would say takbeer on every high ground three times, then he would say, ‘Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer. Aayiboona taa’iboona ‘aabidoona, saajidoona li rabbina haamidoon. Sadaqa Allahu wa’dah wa nasara ‘abdah wa hazama al-ahzaaba wahdah (There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion, to Him be all praise, and He is Able to do all things. Returning, repenting, worshipping, prostrating to our Lord and praising Him. Allah fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave and defeated the confederates Alone). Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. It was narrated that Anas said: We came back with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when we reached the outskirts of Madeenah he said: “Aayiboona taa’iboona ‘aabidoona li rabbina haamidoon (Returning, repenting, worshipping and praising our Lord).” And he kept saying that until we came to Madeenah. Narrated by Muslim. 24 – The Sunnah when returning home is to start by going to the mosque that is nearest one's home and praying two rak’ahs with the intention of offering salaat al-qudoom (the prayer of arrival), because of the hadith of Ka’b ibn Maalik, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he came back from a journey, would start by going to the mosque where he would pray two rak’ahs and then sit down. Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 25 – It is mustahabb to make food for the returning traveller, whether it is made by the traveller himself or by someone else for him, as indicated by the hadith of Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he came back to Madeenah from a journey, would slaughter a camel or a cow. Narrated by al-Bukhaari. 26 – It is haraam for a woman to travel without a mahram unnecessarily, whether that is a long or a short distance, because of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel for the distance of one day and one night except with a mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. End quote from al-Nawawi. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The etiquette of travelling for Hajj is divided into two categories: obligatory and mustahabb. The obligatory etiquette means that the traveller should fulfil all the obligations and pillars (essential parts) of Hajj, and avoid the things that are forbidden in ihraam in particular, and the things that are forbidden in general, whether they are forbidden in ihraam or when not in ihraam, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajjtherein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj” [al-Baqarah 2:197] The mustahabb etiquette when travelling for Hajj is for a person to do all the things that he should do, such as being generous to people, serving his brothers, putting up with their annoyance, not retaliating to mistreatment, and being kind to them, whether that is after he puts on the ihraam or before, because this etiquette is sublime and good, and is required of every believer at all times and in all places. There are also other points of etiquette that has to do with the act of worship, such as doing Hajj in the most perfect manner and striving to do it with the proper etiquette in both word and deed. End quote. Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/16."
Selling on consignment and selling a product before it arrives,"Question What, in your view, is the shar’i ruling on selling on consignment and selling goods bought from abroad before they arrive in one’s store?","Praise be to Allah.The first question is: what is the ruling on selling on consignment? This means that a person says, I will sell you these goods – whatever you manage to sell will come under this deal, and whatever you do not sell, I will take back. This transaction in haraam, because it clearly involves an unknown element as neither the vendor nor the purchaser knows how much of the goods will be sold. The issue here is jahaalah (ignorance, not knowing). It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade sales that involve undue risk (gharar) and this is clearly a risky transaction. But if the two sides have to do a deal, then the owner of the goods should give them to the other party to sell them on his behalf, and give him a reward for acting as his agent. This will achieve the aim of both parties, with the latter acting as an agent for the former. There is nothing wrong with this. As for selling goods before they arrive, this is not permitted either, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade selling from the same place where goods are bought before the trader has actually acquired them (lit. added them to his own luggage). He should first take possession of them, then he can sell them. As for selling them when they are in another country, when he does not know if they will arrive intact or not, this is not permitted. If a person were to say that the purchaser is obliged to accept the goods “as is”, whether they are defective or not, our response is: a person may agree to that, hoping to make a profit, but if the goods turn out to be defective, he will regret it and be upset, and a dispute may arise between him and the vendor. Islam – praise be to Allaah – has blocked the way to regret, disputes and conflict. By the same token, if the goods get destroyed en route, conflicts may arise between the two parties. The point here is that it is not permitted to sell goods until they have have reached the vendor, then he may sell them."
